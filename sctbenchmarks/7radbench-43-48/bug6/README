Bug 6 #526805)
a.k.a. NSPR-3
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

NSPR Bug

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=526805

(or docs folder) for more information.

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------

PR_RWLock_Wlock (prrwlock.c)
PR_RWLock_Rlock (prrwlock.c)
PR_RWLock_Unlock (prrwlock.c)

------------------------------
Makefile Targets
------------------------------

The Makefile has two targets

make:
This does the default buggy build

make sleep: 
this does the default buggy build but with an extra sleep added in
ptsynch.c and ptthread.c to make the bug more likely to occur

------------------------------
Where is the source from?
------------------------------

The source for nspr was retrieved by executing the following commands

$ wget https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases/v4.8/src/nspr-4.8.tar.gz

------------------------------
Bug
------------------------------

If a reader tries to recursively reacquire its reader lock after a writer has
shown up (and is waiting) deadlock will result.

Compare src/rwlock-test.c and src/rwlock-test-sleep.c to see the difference.
