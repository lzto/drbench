Bug 2 (Bug #476934)
a.k.a. SpiderMonkey-1
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

Firefox Javascript Bug--atomicity violation in garbage collector can result in
null pointer dereference. See docs folder or

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=476934

for more information.

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------


JS_SetContextThread (jsapi.cpp)
{JS,js}_ClearContextThread (jsapi.cpp, jscntxt.cpp)
JS_BeginRequest (jsapi.cpp)
{JS,js}_GC (jsapi.cpp, jsgc.cpp)
JS_EndRequest (jsapi.cpp)

------------------------------
Where is the source from?
------------------------------

The source comes from the separately released NSPR 4.6.7 (July 6, 2007)
threading package and JS 1.7.0 engine (Oct 19, 2007):

$ wget https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases/v4.6.7/src/nspr-4.6.7.tar.gz
$ wget ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/js-1.7.0.tar.gz

------------------------------
Scripted Build
------------------------------

in the scripts/ folder contains:

build-js.sh: 
automates the buggy source build.

build-testharness.sh:
build script for the test harness.

clean.sh:
deletes test harness, unzipped sources, and built binaries.

------------------------------
The Bug
------------------------------

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src/js/src/Linux_All_DBG.OBJ bin/test-ctxt
Segmentation fault

This bug manifests fairly rarely.  To make it occur more often try increasing
THREADS, MAX_CALLS, and MAX_GC in src/test-ctxt.cpp and recompiling the test
harness.

There is some debate in the bug report about whether this bug is a misuse of
the JS engine API.  Comment 4 by Brendan Eich suggests to me that this is
indeed a valid way to use the API. Specifically:

"Igor, it was never legal to use JS_THREADSAFE but not JS_BeginRequest(cx)
before calling JS_DestroyContext*.

JS_ClearContextThread is a different issue, arguably, although it too could be
called in a request (on a different context, say a root or dummy context)."

That is, you cannot call JS_DestroyContext*() outside of a request but
JS_ClearContext() could arguably be called outside of a request.  I note this
because it seems making the JS_ClearContext() call inside a request seems to
prevent the segfault.
