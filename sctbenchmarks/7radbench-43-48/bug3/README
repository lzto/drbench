Bug 3 (Bug #478336)
a.k.a. SpiderMonkey-2
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

SpiderMonkey Javascript Bug

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478336

for more information.

Bug is intermittent and will manifest itself as follows:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/js/src/Linux_All_DBG.OBJ/ ./test-js
Assertion failure: JS_PROPERTY_CACHE(cx).disabled >= 0, at jsinterp.c:509
Aborted

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------

JS_BeginRequest (jsapi.cpp)
{JS,js}_DestroyContext (jsapi.cpp, jscnxt.cpp)

------------------------------
Reproduction with Sleeps
------------------------------

To reproduce this bug with sleeps add the following lines in src/js/src/jsgc.c
from the js-1.8.0-rc1.tar.gz bundle:


at line 2954 just before the the "void js_GC(...)" definition:

int is_first = 1;


at line 3468 (after "#endif /* JS_SCOPE_DEPTH_METER */" and before
"JS_LOCK_GC(rt)"):

  if (is_first) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Sleeping!\n");
      is_first = 0;
      sleep(1);
      fprintf(stderr, "Back Awake!\n");
  }

This does *not* cause failure in the patched version 
(patch must have worked :).

------------------------------
Where is the source from?
------------------------------

The source for nspr and js were retrieved by executing the following commands
(taken from the build script attached to the bug report):


$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases/v4.7.3/src/nspr-4.7.3.tar.gz
$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/js-1.8.0-rc1.tar.gz

------------------------------
Scripted Build
------------------------------

The scripts/ folder contains:

build-js.sh: build script to automate the js engine build.  Takes one parameter
(1.7/1.8/1.8-patch). 1.7 is an older version which does not exhibit the same
bug.  1.8 is the buggy version. 1.8-patch applies the patches suggested in the
bug report to fix the bug.

build-testharness.sh:
build script for the test harness

clean.sh:
deletes testharness and firefox src and objects
