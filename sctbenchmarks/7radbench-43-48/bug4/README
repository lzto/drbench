------------------------------
Bug 4 (Bug #354593)
a.k.a NSPR-1
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

NSPR Bug

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354593

(or docs folder) for more information.

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------

MT_safe_localtime (prtime.c)

------------------------------
Makefile Targets
------------------------------

The Makefile has three targets

make:
This does the default buggy build

make sleep: 
this does the default buggy build but with an extra sleep added in
prtime.c to make the bug more likely to occur

make patch: 
this applies the bug fix and then does the build

------------------------------
Where is the source from?
------------------------------

The source for nspr was retrieved by executing the following commands

$ wget http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/nspr/releases/v4.6.4/src/nspr-4.6.4.tar.gz

------------------------------
Bug
------------------------------

A poorly synchronized initialization can result in multiple copies of a
specific monitor mutex being allocated.  This can allow multiple threads into a
single critical section.  Manifests as an assertion presumably because the NSPR
library does some tracking in critical sections to make sure everything is
sane.

See mozilla/nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prtime.c at line ~580.
