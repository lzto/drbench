@section About This Manual

@cindex online location of manual
@cindex manual, online location

This is the @code{MySQL} reference manual; it documents @code{MySQL}
up to Version @value{mysqlversion}. Functional changes are always
indicated with reference to the version, so this manual is also suitable
if you are using an older version of the @code{MySQL} software
(such as 3.23 or 4.0-production).
There are also references for version 5.0 (development).

Being a reference manual, it does not provide general instruction on
@code{SQL} or relational database concepts. It also will not teach you how to
use your operating system or command line interpreter.

As the @code{MySQL Database Software} is under constant development,
the manual is also updated frequently.
The most recent version of this manual is available at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/documentation/} in many different formats,
including HTML, PDF, and Windows HLP versions.

@cindex manual, available formats
@cindex Texinfo

The primary document is the Texinfo file.
The HTML version is produced automatically using a modified version of
@code{texi2html}.
The plain text and Info versions are produced with @code{makeinfo}.
The PostScript version is produced using @code{texi2dvi} and @code{dvips}.
The PDF version is produced with @code{pdftex}.

The index can assist you in finding information in the manual. For online use,
you can try the searchable version of the manual available at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/doc/}.

If you have any suggestions concerning additions or corrections to this
manual, please send them to the documentation team at @email{docs@@mysql.com}.

This manual was initially written by David Axmark and Michael (Monty)
Widenius. It is now maintained by the MySQL Documentation Team,
consisting of Arjen Lentz, Paul DuBois and Stefan Hinz.

@subsection Conventions Used in This Manual

This manual uses certain typographical conventions:

@cindex manual, typographical conventions
@cindex typographical conventions
@cindex conventions, typographical

@table @asis
@item @code{constant}
Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL statements;
database, table, and column names; C and Perl code; and environment variables.
Example: ``To see how @code{mysqladmin} works, invoke it with the
@code{--help} option.''

@item @file{filename}
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and
pathnames.  Example: ``The distribution is installed under the
@file{/usr/local/} directory.''

@item @samp{c}
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate
character sequences.  Example: ``To specify a wildcard, use the @samp{%}
character.''

@item @emph{italic}
Italic font is used for emphasis, @emph{like this}.

@item @strong{boldface}
Boldface font is used in table headings and to convey
@strong{especially strong emphasis}.
@end table

When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular
program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.  For
example, @code{shell>} indicates a command that you execute from your login
shell, and @code{mysql>} indicates a statement that you execute from the
@code{mysql} client program:

@example
shell> type a shell command here
mysql> type a mysql statement here
@end example

The ``shell'' is your command interpreter. On Unix, this is typically a
program such as @code{sh} or @code{csh}. On Windows, the equivalent is
@code{command.com} or @code{cmd.exe}, typically run in a Windows console.

Note that to enter a command or statement from an example, you do not type
the prompt shown in the example.

Commands to set shell variables are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you
are using @code{csh} or @code{tcsh}, you will need to issue commands somewhat
differently.
For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command
looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

@example
shell> VARNAME=value some_command
@end example

@cindex shell syntax
@cindex command syntax

For @code{csh} or @code{tcsh}, you would execute the sequence like this:

@example
shell> setenv VARNAME value
shell> some_command
@end example

Database, table, and column names must often be substituted into commands.  To
indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual uses
@code{db_name}, @code{tbl_name}, and @code{col_name}.  For example, you might
see a statement like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;
@end example

This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would supply
your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;
@end example

SQL keywords are not case sensitive and may be written in uppercase or
lowercase.  This manual uses uppercase.

In syntax descriptions, square brackets (@samp{[} and @samp{]}) are used
to indicate optional words or clauses.  For example, in the following
statement, @code{IF EXISTS} is optional:

@example
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name
@end example

When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the alternatives
are separated by vertical bars (@samp{|}).  When one member from a set of
choices @strong{may} be chosen, the alternatives are listed within square
brackets (@samp{[} and @samp{]}):

@example
TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)
@end example

When one member from a set of choices @strong{must} be chosen, the
alternatives are listed within braces (@samp{@{} and @samp{@}}):

@example
@{DESCRIBE | DESC@} tbl_name @{col_name | wild@}
@end example

An ellipsis (@code{...}) indicates the omission of a section of a statement,
typically to provide a shorter version of more complex syntax. For example,
@code{INSERT ... SELECT} is shorthand for the form of @code{INSERT} statement
that is followed by a @code{SELECT} statement.

An ellipsis can also indicate that the preceding syntax element of a statement
may be repeated. In the following example, multiple @code{reset_option} values
may be given, with each of those after the first preceded by commas:

@example
RESET reset_option [,reset_option] ...
@end example


@node What-is, What is MySQL AB, Manual-info, Introduction
@section Overview of the MySQL Database Management System

@cindex MySQL, defined
@cindex MySQL, introduction

@code{MySQL}, the most popular @code{Open Source} SQL database management
system, is
developed, distributed, and supported by @code{MySQL AB}.  @code{MySQL AB} is a
commercial company, founded by the MySQL developers, that builds its business
by providing services around the @code{MySQL} database management system.
@xref{What is MySQL AB}.

The @code{MySQL} Web site (@uref{http://www.mysql.com/})
provides the latest information about @code{MySQL} software and
@code{MySQL AB}.

@table @asis

@c TODO: These item headings are not consistent in tone. Some ask questions,
@c others are statements...

@item @code{MySQL} is a database management system.

A database is a structured collection of data.  It may be anything from a
simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of
information in a corporate network.  To add, access, and process data
stored in a computer database, you need a database management system
such as @code{MySQL} Server.  Since computers are very good at handling large
amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing,
as stand-alone utilities or as parts of other applications.

@cindex databases, defined

@item MySQL is a relational database management system.

A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting
all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and flexibility.
The @code{SQL} part of ``@code{MySQL}'' stands for ``@code{Structured
Query Language}.'' SQL is the most common standardized language used to
access databases and is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL Standard.(The SQL 
standard has been evolving since 1986 and several versions exist. In this 
manual, ``@code{SQL-92}'' refers to the standard released in 1992,
``@code{SQL:1999}'' refers to the standard released in 1999, and
``@code{SQL:2003}'' refers to the current version of the standard.
We use the term ``@code{the SQL standard}'' to 
mean the current version of the SQL Standard at any time.)


@cindex relational databases, defined
@cindex SQL, defined
@item MySQL software is @code{Open Source}.

@code{Open Source} means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software.
Anybody can download the @code{MySQL} software from the Internet and use it
without paying anything.  If you wish, you may study the source code
and change it to suit your needs.  The @code{MySQL} software uses the
@code{GPL} (@code{GNU General Public License}),
@uref{http://www.fsf.org/licenses/}, to define what you
may and may not do with the software in different situations.
If you feel uncomfortable with the @code{GPL} or need to embed
@code{MySQL} code into a commercial application, you can buy a
commercially licensed version from us.
@xref{MySQL licenses}.

@cindex @code{Open Source}, defined
@cindex General Public License

@item Why use the MySQL Database Server?

The @code{MySQL Database Server} is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.
If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try.
@code{MySQL Server} also has a practical set of features developed in
close cooperation with our users.  You can find a performance comparison
of @code{MySQL Server} with other database managers on our benchmark page.
@xref{MySQL Benchmarks}.

@code{MySQL Server} was originally developed to handle large databases
much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in
highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though
under constant development, @code{MySQL Server} today offers a rich and
useful set of functions.  Its connectivity, speed, and security make
@code{MySQL Server} highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

@item The technical features of MySQL Server

The @code{MySQL Database Software} is a client/server system that consists
of a multi-threaded @code{SQL} server that supports different backends,
several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools,
and a wide range of application programming interfaces (APIs).

We also provide @code{MySQL Server} as a multi-threaded library which you
can link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier-to-manage
product.

@item There is a large amount of contributed MySQL software available.

It is very likely that you will find that your favorite application or
language already supports the @code{MySQL Database Server}.

@cindex MySQL history
@cindex history of MySQL
@cindex MySQL name
@cindex My, derivation
@cindex MySQL Dolphin name
@cindex Sakila

We started out with the intention of using @code{mSQL} to connect to our
tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some
testing, we came to the conclusion that @code{mSQL} was not fast enough or
flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to our
database but with almost the same API interface as @code{mSQL}.  This API was
designed to allow third-party code that was written for use with @code{mSQL} to
be ported easily for use with @code{MySQL}.

The derivation of the name @code{MySQL} is not clear.  Our base
directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix
``my'' for well over 10 years.  However, co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter
is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to
@code{MySQL} is still a mystery, even for us.

The name of the MySQL Dolphin (our logo) is @code{Sakila}. @code{Sakila} was chosen
by the founders of MySQL AB from a huge list of names suggested by users
in our ``Name the Dolphin'' contest. The winning name was submitted by
Ambrose Twebaze, an open source software developer from Swaziland, Africa.
According to Ambrose, the name Sakila has its roots in SiSwati, the local
language of Swaziland. Sakila is also the name of a town in Arusha,
Tanzania, near Ambrose's country of origin, Uganda.

@subsection The Main Features of MySQL

@cindex main features of MySQL
@cindex features of MySQL

The following list describes some of the important characteristics
of the @code{MySQL Database Software}. @xref{MySQL 4.0 Nutshell}.

@c This list is too technical and should be divided into one feature
@c list comparable to commercial competition and a very technical on
@c with max limits (from crash-me) and so on.
@table @asis
@item Internals and Portability
@itemize @bullet
@item
Written in C and C++.
@item
Tested with a broad range of different compilers.
@item
Works on many different platforms.  @xref{Which OS}.
@item
Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.
@item
APIs for C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Tcl are available.
@xref{Clients}.
@item
Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can easily
use multiple CPUs if they are available.
@item
Provides transactional and non-transactional storage engines.
@item
Uses very fast B-tree disk tables (@code{MyISAM}) with index compression.
@item
Relatively easy to add another storage engine. This is useful if you
want to add an SQL interface to an in-house database.
@item
A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.
@item
Very fast joins using an optimized one-sweep multi-join.
@item
In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.
@item
SQL functions are implemented using a highly optimized class library and
should be as fast as possible.  Usually there is no memory allocation
at all after query initialization.
@item
The @code{MySQL} code is tested with Purify
(a commercial memory leakage detector) as well as with Valgrind,
a @code{GPL} tool (@uref{http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/}).
@item
The server is available as a separate program for use in a client/server
networked environment.  It is also available as a library that can be
embedded (linked) into standalone applications. Such applications can be
used in isolation or in environments where no network is available.
@end itemize

@item Column Types
@itemize @bullet
@item
Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes
long, @code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE}, @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR},
@code{TEXT}, @code{BLOB}, @code{DATE}, @code{TIME}, @code{DATETIME},
@code{TIMESTAMP}, @code{YEAR}, @code{SET}, @code{ENUM}, and OpenGIS geometry
types.
@xref{Column types}.
@item
Fixed-length and variable-length records.
@end itemize

@item Commands and Functions
@itemize @bullet
@item
Full operator and function support in the @code{SELECT} and @code{WHERE}
clauses of queries.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
    -> FROM tbl_name
    -> WHERE income/dependents > 10000 AND age > 30;
@end example

@item
Full support for SQL @code{GROUP BY} and
@code{ORDER BY} clauses.  Support
for group functions (@code{COUNT()},
@code{COUNT(DISTINCT ...)},
@code{AVG()}, @code{STD()},
@code{SUM()}, @code{MAX()}, @code{MIN()}, and @code{GROUP_CONCAT()}).
@item
Support for @code{LEFT OUTER JOIN} and @code{RIGHT OUTER JOIN} with both standard
SQL and ODBC syntax.
@item
Support for aliases on tables and columns as required by standard SQL.
@item
@code{DELETE}, @code{INSERT}, @code{REPLACE}, and @code{UPDATE} return
the number of rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return
the number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the
server.
@item
The @code{MySQL}-specific @code{SHOW} command can be used to retrieve
information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The @code{EXPLAIN} command
can be used to determine how the optimizer resolves a query.
@item
Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For example,
@code{ABS} is a valid column name.  The only restriction is that for a
function call, no spaces are allowed between the function name and the
@samp{(} that follows it.  @xref{Reserved words}.
@item
You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as of
Version 3.22).
@end itemize

@item Security
@itemize @bullet
@item
A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure, and
allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because all
password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.
@end itemize

@item Scalability and Limits
@itemize @bullet
@item
Handles large databases.  We use @code{MySQL Server} with databases that 
contain 50 million records. We also know of users who
use @code{MySQL Server} with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows.
@item
Up to 64 indexes per table are allowed (32 before MySQL 4.1.2).  Each index may
consist of 1 to 16 columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index width is
1000 bytes (500 before MySQL 4.1.2).
An index may use a prefix of a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} column.
@end itemize

@item Connectivity
@itemize @bullet
@item
Clients may connect to the @code{MySQL} server using TCP/IP sockets
on any platform.  On Windows systems in the NT family (NT, 2000,
or XP), clients may connect using named pipes. On Unix systems,
clients may connect using Unix domain socket files.
@item
The Connector/ODBC interface provides @code{MySQL} support for client programs
that use ODBC (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) connections.  For example,

@node Stability, Table size, Features, What-is
@subsection MySQL Stability

@cindex stability

This section addresses the questions ``@emph{How stable is MySQL Server?}''
and ``@emph{Can I depend on MySQL Server in this project?}''
We will try to clarify these issues and answer some important
questions that concern many potential users. The information in this
section is based on data gathered from the mailing list, which is
very active in identifying problems as well as reporting types of use.

The original code stems back to the early 1980s. It provides a stable code
base, and the @code{ISAM} table format used by the original storage engine
remains backward-compatible.
At TcX, the predecessor of @code{MySQL AB}, @code{MySQL} code has worked
in projects since mid-1996, without any problems.
When the @code{MySQL Database Software} initially was released to a wider public,
our new users quickly found some pieces of ``untested code.'' Each new release
since then has had fewer portability problems (even though each new release
has also had many new features).

Each release of the @code{MySQL Server} has been usable. Problems have occurred
only when users try code from the ``gray zones.''  Naturally, new users
don't know what the gray zones are; this section therefore attempts to
document those areas that are currently known.
The descriptions mostly deal with Version 3.23 and 4.0 of @code{MySQL Server}.
All known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest version, with the
exception of those listed in the bugs section, which
are design-related.  @xref{Bugs}.

The @code{MySQL Server} design is multi-layered with independent modules.
Some of the newer modules are listed here with an indication of how
well-tested each of them is:

@cindex modules, list of

@table @asis
@item Replication --- Gamma
Large groups of servers using replication are in production use, with
good results. Work on enhanced replication features is continuing
in @code{MySQL} 5.x.

@item @code{InnoDB} tables --- Stable (in 3.23 from 3.23.49)
The @code{InnoDB} transactional storage engine has been declared
stable in the @code{MySQL} 3.23 tree, starting from version 3.23.49.
@code{InnoDB} is being used in large, heavy-load production systems.

@item @code{BDB} tables --- Gamma
The @code{Berkeley DB} code is very stable, but we are still improving
the @code{BDB} transactional storage engine interface in
@code{MySQL Server}, so it will take some time before this is as well
tested as the other table types.

@item Full-text searches --- Beta
Full-text searching works but is not yet widely used.
Important enhancements have been implemented in @code{MySQL} 4.0.

@item @code{Connector/ODBC 3.51} (uses ODBC SDK 3.51) --- Stable
In wide production use. Some issues brought up appear to be
application-related and independent of the ODBC driver or underlying
database server.

@item Automatic recovery of @code{MyISAM} tables --- Gamma
This status applies only to the new code in the @code{MyISAM} storage
engine that checks if the table was closed properly on open and
executes an automatic check or repair of the table if it wasn't.

@end table

Paying customers receive high-quality support directly from MySQL AB.
MySQL AB also provides the MySQL mailing list as a community resource
where anyone may ask questions.

Bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch. For serious bugs, there
is almost always a new release.


@node Table size, Year 2000 compliance, Stability, What-is
@subsection How Big MySQL Tables Can Be

@c TODO: move to MyISAM storage engine section, replace with
@c more general "limits" section.

@cindex tables, maximum size
@cindex size of tables
@cindex operating systems, file-size limits
@cindex limits, file-size
@cindex files, size limits

@code{MySQL} Version 3.22 had a 4GB (4 gigabyte) limit on table size. With the
@code{MyISAM} storage engine in @code{MySQL} Version 3.23, the maximum table
size was increased to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes). With this larger
allowed table size, the maximum effective table size for @code{MySQL}
databases now normally is determined by operating system constraints
on file sizes, not by MySQL internal limits.

The @code{InnoDB} storage engine maintains @code{InnoDB} tables within a
tablespace that can be created from several files. This allows a
table to exceed the maximum individual file size. The tablespace can include
raw disk partitions, which allows extremely large tables. The maximum
tablespace size is 64 TB.

The following table lists some examples of operating system file-size
limits:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .50
@item @strong{Operating System} @tab @strong{File-size Limit}
@item Linux-Intel 32-bit        @tab 2GB, much more when using LFS
@item Linux-Alpha               @tab 8TB (?)
@item Solaris 2.5.1             @tab 2GB (4GB possible with patch)
@item Solaris 2.6               @tab 4GB (can be changed with flag)
@item Solaris 2.7 Intel         @tab 4GB
@item Solaris 2.7 UltraSPARC    @tab 512GB
@item NetWare w/NSS filesystem  @tab 8TB
@end multitable

On Linux 2.2, you can get @code{MyISAM} tables larger than 2GB in size by
using the LFS patch for the ext2 filesystem. On Linux 2.4, patches also
exist for ReiserFS to get support for big files. Most current Linux
distributions are based on kernel 2.4 and already include all the required
Large File Support (LFS) patches. However, the maximum available file size
still depends on several factors, one of them being the filesystem used to
store MySQL tables.

For a very detailed overview about LFS in Linux, have a look at Andreas
Jaeger's ``Large File Support in Linux'' page at
@url{http://www.suse.de/~aj/linux_lfs.html}.

By default, @code{MySQL} creates @code{MyISAM} tables with an internal
structure that allows a maximum size of about 4GB.  You can
check the maximum table size for a table with the @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS}
command or with the @code{myisamchk -dv tbl_name}.
@xref{SHOW,  , @code{SHOW}}.

If you need a @code{MyISAM} table that will be larger than 4GB in size (and your
operating system supports large files), the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement
allows @code{AVG_ROW_LENGTH} and @code{MAX_ROWS} options.
@xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.
You can also change these options with @code{ALTER TABLE} after the table has
been created, to increase the table's maximum allowable size.
@xref{ALTER TABLE,  , @code{ALTER TABLE}}.

Other ways to work around file-size limits for @code{MyISAM} tables are as
follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If your large table is read-only, you can use @code{myisampack} to
compress it.  @code{myisampack} usually compresses a table by at
least 50%, so you can have, in effect, much bigger tables.
@code{myisampack} also can merge multiple tables into a single table.
@xref{myisampack, , @code{myisampack}}.

@item
Another way to get around the operating system file limit for @code{MyISAM}
data files is by using the @code{RAID} options.
@xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

@item
@code{MySQL} includes a @code{MERGE} library that allows
you to handle a collection of @code{MyISAM} tables that have identical
structure as a single @code{MERGE} table.
@xref{MERGE, , @code{MERGE} tables}.

@end itemize


@node Year 2000 compliance,  , Table size, What-is
@subsection Year 2000 Compliance

@cindex Year 2000 compliance
@cindex compliance, Y2K
@cindex date functions, Y2K compliance

The @code{MySQL Server} itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K)
compliance:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{MySQL Server} uses Unix time functions that handle dates into the year
@code{2037} for @code{TIMESTAMP} values. For @code{DATE} and @code{DATETIME}
values, dates through the year @code{9999} are accepted.

@item
All @code{MySQL} date functions are implemented in one source file,
@file{sql/time.cc}, and are coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.

@item
In @code{MySQL} Version 3.22 and later, the @code{YEAR} column type
can store years @code{0} and @code{1901} to @code{2155} in one byte and
display them using two or four digits.
All two-digit years are considered to be in the range
@code{1970} to @code{2069}, which means that if you store @code{01} in a
@code{YEAR} column, @code{MySQL Server} treats it as @code{2001}.
@end itemize

The following simple demonstration illustrates that @code{MySQL Server}
doesn't have any problems with dates until after the year 2030:

@example
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS y2k;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE y2k (date DATE,
    ->                   date_time DATETIME,
    ->                   time_stamp TIMESTAMP);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO y2k VALUES
    -> ('1998-12-31','1998-12-31 23:59:59',19981231235959),
    -> ('1999-01-01','1999-01-01 00:00:00',19990101000000),
    -> ('1999-09-09','1999-09-09 23:59:59',19990909235959),

@end example

The final @code{TIMESTAMP} column value is zero because the final
year (@code{2050}) exceeds the @code{TIMESTAMP} maximum.  The
@code{TIMESTAMP} data type, which is used to store the current time,
supports values that range from @code{19700101000000} to
@code{20300101000000} on 32-bit machines (signed value).  On 64-bit
machines, @code{TIMESTAMP} handles values up to @code{2106} (unsigned
value).

The example also shows that the @code{DATE} and @code{DATETIME} data types have
no problems with the dates used. They handle dates through the year
@code{9999}.

Although @code{MySQL Server} itself is Y2K-safe, you may run into
problems if you use it with applications that are not Y2K-safe.
For example, many old applications store or manipulate years using
two-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than four-digit values.
This problem may be compounded by applications that use
values such as @code{00} or @code{99} as ``missing'' value indicators.
Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix because different
applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may
use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.

Thus, even though @code{MySQL Server} has no Y2K problems, it is
the application's responsibility to provide unambiguous input.
See @ref{Y2K issues} for @code{MySQL Server}'s rules for dealing
with ambiguous date input data that contains two-digit year values.

Technical support from @code{MySQL AB} means individualized answers
to your unique problems direct from the software engineers who code
the @code{MySQL} database engine.

We try to take a broad and inclusive view of technical support. Almost
any problem involving @code{MySQL} software is important to us if it's
important to you.
Typically customers seek help on how to get different commands and
utilities to work, remove performance bottlenecks, restore crashed
systems, understand the impact of operating system or networking issues
on @code{MySQL},
set up best practices for backup and recovery, utilize APIs, and so on.
Our support covers only the @code{MySQL} server and our own utilities,
not third-party products that access the @code{MySQL} server, though we
try to help with these where we can.

Detailed information about our various support options is given at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/support/}, where support contracts can also be
ordered online. If you have restricted access to the Internet, please contact
our sales staff via email at @email{sales@@mysql.com}.

Technical support is like life insurance. You can live happily
without it for years. However, when your hour arrives, it becomes
critically important, but it's too late to buy it.
If you use @code{MySQL Server} for important applications and encounter
sudden difficulties, it may be too time consuming to figure out all the
answers yourself. You may need immediate access to the most experienced
@code{MySQL} troubleshooters available, those employed by @code{MySQL AB}.

The @code{MySQL} software is released under the
@code{GNU General Public License} (@code{GPL}),
which is probably the best known @code{Open Source} license.
The formal terms of the @code{GPL} license can be found at
@uref{http://www.fsf.org/licenses/}.
See also @uref{http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html} and
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html}.

Since the @code{MySQL} software is released under the @code{GPL},
it may often be used for free, but for certain uses you may want
or need to buy commercial licenses from @code{MySQL AB} at
@uref{https://order.mysql.com/}.
See @uref{http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing/} for
more information.

Older versions of @code{MySQL} (3.22 and earlier) are subject to a

See the documentation of the specific version for information.

Please note that the use of the @code{MySQL} software under commercial

@subsubsection Using the MySQL Software Under a Commercial License

The @code{GPL} license is contagious in the sense that when a program
is linked to a @code{GPL} program all the source code for all the parts
of the resulting product must also be released under the @code{GPL}.
If you do not follow this @code{GPL} requirement, you break the license 
terms and forfeit your right to use the @code{GPL} program altogether. 
You also risk damages.

You need a commercial license:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When you link a program with any @code{GPL} code from the @code{MySQL}
software and don't want the resulting product to be licensed under @code{GPL}, 
perhaps because you want to build a commercial product or keep the added
non-@code{GPL} code closed source for other reasons. When purchasing
commercial licenses, you are not using the @code{MySQL} software under
@code{GPL} even though it's the same code.

@item
When you distribute a non-@code{GPL} application that @strong{only} works with the
@code{MySQL} software and ship it with the @code{MySQL} software. This type
of solution is considered to be linking even if it's done over a network.

@item
When you distribute copies of the @code{MySQL} software without providing
the source code as required under the @code{GPL} license.

@item
When you want to support the further development of the @code{MySQL}
database even if you don't formally need a commercial license.
Purchasing support directly from @code{MySQL AB} is another good way
of contributing to the development of the @code{MySQL} software, with
immediate advantages for you.
@xref{Support}.
@end itemize

If you require a license, you will need one for each installation of the
@code{MySQL} software. This covers any number of CPUs on a machine, and there
is no artificial limit on the number of clients that connect to the server
in any way.

For commercial licenses, please visit our Web site at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/products/licensing/}.
For support contracts, see @uref{http://www.mysql.com/support/}.
If you have special needs or you have restricted access to the Internet,
please contact our sales staff via email at @email{sales@@mysql.com}.

@subsubsection Using the MySQL Software for Free Under GPL

@cindex licensing, free
@cindex free licensing

You can use the @code{MySQL} software for free under the @code{GPL} if
you adhere to the conditions of the @code{GPL}.
For additional details, including answers to common questions about the @code{GPL},
see the generic FAQ from the Free Software Foundation at
@uref{http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html}. 
Common uses of the @code{GPL} include:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When you distribute both your own application and the @code{MySQL}
source code under the @code{GPL} with your product.

@item
When you distribute the @code{MySQL} source code bundled with other
programs that are not linked to or dependent on the @code{MySQL} system
for their functionality even if you sell the distribution commercially.
This is called mere aggregation in the @code{GPL} license.

@item
When you are not distributing @strong{any} part of the @code{MySQL}
system, you can use it for free.

@item
@cindex ISP services
@cindex services, ISP
@cindex services, Web
@cindex Internet Service Providers
When you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), offering Web hosting
with @code{MySQL} servers for your customers.
We encourage people to use ISPs that have MySQL support,
as this will give them the confidence that their ISP will, in fact, 
have the resources to solve any problems they may experience with 
the @code{MySQL} installation. Even if an ISP does not have
a commercial license for @code{MySQL Server}, their customers 
should at least be given read access to the source of the @code{MySQL}
installation so that the customers can verify that it is correctly patched.

@item
@cindex Web server, running
@cindex running a Web server
When you use the @code{MySQL} database software in conjunction with a
Web server, you do not need a commercial license (so long as it is not
a product you distribute). This is true even if you run a commercial
Web server that uses @code{MySQL Server}, because you are not
distributing any part of the @code{MySQL} system. However, in this
case we would like you to purchase @code{MySQL} support because the
@code{MySQL} software is helping your enterprise.
@end itemize

If your use of @code{MySQL} database software does not require a commercial
license, we encourage you to purchase support from @code{MySQL AB} anyway.
This way you contribute toward @code{MySQL} development and also gain
immediate advantages for yourself. @xref{Support}.

If you use the @code{MySQL} database software in a commercial context
such that you profit by its use, we ask that you further the development
of the @code{MySQL} software by purchasing some level of support.  We feel
that if the @code{MySQL} database helps your business, it is reasonable to
ask that you help @code{MySQL AB}.
(Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only using
for free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're asking
us to provide free support, too.)

@node Roadmap, TODO, Licensing and Support, Introduction
@section MySQL Development Roadmap

This section provides a snapshot of the MySQL development roadmap, including
major features implemented or planned for MySQL 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, and 5.1.
The following sections provide information for each release series.

The production release series is MySQL 4.0, which was declared stable
for production use as of Version 4.0.12, released in March 2003. This
means that future 4.0 development will be limited only to making bug
fixes. For the older MySQL 3.23 series, only critical bug fixes will
be made.

Active MySQL development currently is taking place in the MySQL 4.1 and
5.0 release series. This means that new features are being added to MySQL
4.1 and MySQL 5.0. Both 4.1 and 5.0 are available now in alpha status.

Before upgrading from one release series to the next, please see the notes
at @ref{Upgrade}.

Plans for some of the most requested features are summarized in the following

are now standard features.
@xref{InnoDB,  , @code{InnoDB}}.
@end itemize

@item New functionality
@itemize @bullet
@item
The enhanced @code{FULLTEXT} search properties of MySQL Server 4.0 enables
@code{FULLTEXT} indexing of large text masses with both binary

enabling a new set of applications to be built with MySQL Server.
@xref{Fulltext Search}.
@end itemize

@item Standards compliance, portability, and migration
@itemize @bullet
@item
Many users will also be happy to learn that MySQL Server now supports the
@code{UNION} statement, a long-awaited standard SQL feature.

@item
MySQL now runs natively on the Novell NetWare 6.0 platform.
@xref{NetWare installation}.

@item
Features to simplify migration from other database systems to MySQL
Server include @code{TRUNCATE TABLE} (as in Oracle).
@c commented out IDENTITY until someone explains what it means
@c and @code{IDENTITY}
@c as a synonym for automatically incremented keys (as in Sybase).
@end itemize

@item Internationalization
@itemize @bullet
@item
Our German, Austrian, and Swiss users will note that @code{MySQL} now

@emph{German sorting order} sorts words with umlauts in the same order 
as do German telephone books.
@end itemize

@item Usability enhancements
In the process of implementing features for new users, we have not forgotten
requests from our loyal community of existing users.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Most @code{mysqld} parameters (startup options) can now be set without taking
down the server. This is a convenient feature for database administrators
(DBAs).
@xref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET OPTION}}.

@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} and @code{UPDATE} statements have been added..

@item
On Windows, symbolic link handling at the database level is enabled by default.
On Unix, the @code{MyISAM} storage engine now supports symbolic
linking at the table level (and not just the database level as before).

@item
@code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} and @code{FOUND_ROWS()} are new functions that make it
possible to find out the number of rows a @code{SELECT} query that includes a
@code{LIMIT} clause would have returned without that clause.

@subsubsection The Embedded MySQL Server

The @code{libmysqld} embedded server library makes MySQL Server suitable for
a vastly expanded realm of applications. By using this library, developers can
embed MySQL Server into various applications and electronics devices, where
the end user has no knowledge of there actually being an underlying
database. Embedded MySQL Server is ideal for use behind
the scenes in Internet appliances, public kiosks, turnkey
hardware/software combination units, high performance Internet
servers, self-contained databases distributed on CD-ROM, and so on.

Many users of @code{libmysqld} will benefit from the MySQL
@emph{Dual Licensing}. For those not wishing to be bound by the @code{GPL},
the software is also made available under a commercial license.
The embedded MySQL library uses the same interface as the normal
client library, so it is convenient and easy to use.

MySQL Server 4.0 laid the foundation for new features implemented in MySQL
4.1, such as subqueries and Unicode support,
and for the work on stored procedures being done in version 5.0.
These features come at the top of the wish list of many of our customers.

With these additions, critics of the MySQL Database Server have to be

Replication can be done over SSL connections.
@end itemize

@item Standards compliance, portability, and migration
@itemize @bullet
@item
The new client/server protocol adds the ability to pass multiple
warnings to the client, rather than only a single result. This
makes operations such as bulk data loading much easier to track.
@item
@code{SHOW WARNINGS} shows warnings for the last command.
@xref{SHOW WARNINGS,  , @code{SHOW WARNINGS}}.
@end itemize

@item Internationalization
@itemize @bullet
@item
To support applications that require the use of local languages,
the MySQL software now offers extensive
Unicode support through the @code{utf8} and @code{ucs2} character sets.
@item
Character sets can now be defined per column, table, and database.
This allows for a high degree of flexibility in application design,
particularly for multi-language Web sites.
@item
For documentation for this improved character set support,
see @ref{Charset}.
@end itemize

@item Usability enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
In response to popular demand, we have added a server-based
@code{HELP} command that can be used
to get help information for SQL statements.
The advantage of having this information on the server side is that the
information is always applicable to the particular server version that you
actually are using.
Because this information is available by issuing an SQL statement, any client
can be written to access it.
For example, the @code{help} command of the @code{mysql} command-line client
has been modified to have this capability.
@item
In the new client/server protocol, multiple statements can be issued with
a single call.
@xref{C API multiple queries}.
@item
The new client/server protocol also supports returning multiple result sets.
This might occur as a result of sending multiple statements, for example.
@item
A new @code{INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...} syntax has been
implemented. This allows you to @code{UPDATE} an existing row if the
@code{INSERT} would have caused a duplicate in a @code{PRIMARY} or
@code{UNIQUE} key (index).
@xref{INSERT,  , @code{INSERT}}.
@item
A new aggregate function, @code{GROUP_CONCAT()}
adds the extremely useful capability of concatenating column values from
grouped rows into a single result string.

@subsubsection Stepwise Rollout

New features are being added to MySQL 4.1. The alpha version is already
available for download. @xref{Nutshell Ready for Immediate Use}.

The set of features that are being added to version 4.1 is mostly
fixed. Additional development is already ongoing for version 5.0.
MySQL 4.1 will go through the steps of
@emph{Alpha} (during which time new features might still be added/changed),
@emph{Beta} (when we have feature freeze and only bug corrections will be done),
and @emph{Gamma} (indicating that a production release is just weeks ahead).
At the end of this process, MySQL 4.1 will become the new production release.


@node Nutshell Ready for Immediate Use,  , Nutshell Stepwise Rollout, MySQL 4.1 Nutshell

The following features are not yet implemented in MySQL 4.1, but are planned
for implementation before MySQL 4.1 moves into its beta phase.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see @ref{Nutshell 4.1 features}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Stable OpenSSL support (MySQL 4.0 supports rudimentary, not 100% tested,
support for OpenSSL).

@subsection New Features Planned for 5.0

The following features are planned for inclusion into MySQL 5.0.
Some of the features such as stored procedures are complete and are
included in MySQL 5.0 alpha, which is available now.  Others such
as cursors are only partially available. Expect these and other
features to mature and be fully supported in upcoming releases.

Note that because we have many developers that are working on different
projects, there will also be many additional features. There is also a
small chance that some of these features will be added to MySQL 4.1.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see @ref{Nutshell 4.1 features}.

For those wishing to take a look at the bleeding edge of MySQL
development, we make our BitKeeper repository for
MySQL version 5.0 publicly available.
@xref{Installing source tree}.
As of December 2003, binary builds of version 5.0 are also available.

@table @asis
@item Stored Procedures
@itemize @bullet
@item
Stored procedures are currently implemented, based on the SQL:2003
standard.
@xref{Stored Procedures}.

@c Commented this out -- it's unclear whether this will happen or how much.

@c We will also implement a framework to hook in external languages,
@c and (where possible) compatibility with, for example, PL/SQL and T-SQL.
@end itemize

@item New functionality
@itemize @bullet
@item
Elementary cursor support.
@xref{Cursors}.
@item
The ability to specify explicitly for @code{MyISAM} tables that an index
should be created as an @code{RTREE} index.  (In MySQL 4.1, @code{RTREE} indexes
are used internally for geometrical data that use GIS data types, but cannot be
created on request.)
@item
Dynamic length rows for @code{HEAP} tables.
@end itemize

@item Standards compliance, portability and migration
@itemize @bullet
@item
Add true @code{VARCHAR} support (column lengths longer than 255, and
no stripping of trailing whitespace).
(There is already support for this in the @code{MyISAM} storage engine,
but it is not yet available at the user level.)
@end itemize

@item Speed enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name} (used by @code{mysql} client to allow
expansions of column names) should not open the table, only the
definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.
@item
Allow @code{DELETE} on @code{MyISAM} tables to use the record cache.
To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
the @file{.MYD} file.
@item
Better support for @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Dynamic length rows.
@item
Faster row handling (less copying).
@end itemize
@end itemize

@item Usability enhancements
@itemize @bullet

@subsection New Features Planned for 5.1

@table @asis
@item New functionality
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{FOREIGN KEY} support for all table types, not just @code{InnoDB}.
@item
Column-level constraints.
@c Commented out, it's not actually on the list
@c @item
@c Fail-safe replication.
@item
Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will
make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the
master.
@end itemize

@c @item Standards compliance, portability and migration
@c @itemize @bullet
@c @end itemize

@item Speed enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
New text based table definition file format (@file{.frm} files) and a
table cache for table definitions.  This will enable us to do faster
queries of table structures and do more efficient foreign key support.
@item
Optimize the @code{BIT} type to take 1 bit. (@code{BIT} now takes 1 byte;
it is treated as a synonym for @code{TINYINT}.)
@end itemize

@c @item Internationalzsation
@c @itemize @bullet
@c @end itemize

@item Usability enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
Add options to the client/server protocol to get progress notes
for long running commands.
@item
Implement @code{RENAME DATABASE}. To make this safe for all storage engines,
it should work as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Create the new database.
@item
For every table do a rename of the table to another database, as
we do with the @code{RENAME} command.
@item
Drop the old database.
@end itemize
@item
New internal file interface change.  This will make all file handling much
more general and make it easier to add extensions like RAID.
@end itemize

@end table


@node TODO future, TODO sometime, TODO MySQL 5.1, TODO
@subsection New Features Planned for the Near Future

@table @asis
@item New functionality
@itemize @bullet
@item
Oracle-like @code{CONNECT BY PRIOR ...} to search tree-like (hierarchical)
structures.
@item
Add all missing standard SQL and ODBC 3.0 types.
@item
Add @code{SUM(DISTINCT)}.
@item
@code{INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT} and @code{mysqld --concurrent-insert} to do
a concurrent insert at the end of a table if the table is read-locked.
@item
Allow variables to be updated in @code{UPDATE} statements. For example:
@code{UPDATE TABLE foo SET @@a=a+b,a=@@a, b=@@a+c}.
@item
Change when user variables are updated so that you can use them with
@code{GROUP BY}, as in the following example:
@code{SELECT id, @@a:=COUNT(*), SUM(sum_col)/@@a FROM tbl_name GROUP BY id}.
@item
Add an @code{IMAGE} option to @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to not update
@code{TIMESTAMP} and @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} fields.
@item
Add @code{LOAD DATA INFILE ... UPDATE} syntax that works like this:
@itemize @bullet
@item
For tables with primary keys, if an input record contains a primary key
value, existing rows matching that primary key value are updated from the
remainder of the input columns. However, columns corresponding to columns
that are @strong{missing} from the input record are not touched.
@item
For tables with primary keys, if an input record does not contain the primary
key value or is missing some part of the key, the record is treated as
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO}.
@end itemize
@item
Make @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} understand syntax like:
@example
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
     TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3)
     SET table_field1=CONCAT(text_field1, text_field2),
         table_field3=23
     IGNORE text_field3
@end example
This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file,
or update columns based on expressions of the read data.
@item
New functions for working with @code{SET} type columns:
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{ADD_TO_SET(value,set)}
@item @code{REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set)}
@end itemize
@item
If you abort @code{mysql} in the middle of a query, you should open
another connection and kill the old running query.
Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.
@item
Add a storage engine interface for table information so that you can use it as a system
table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables,
but very flexible.  @code{SHOW INFO FROM tbl_name} for basic table information
should be implemented.
@item
Allow @code{SELECT a FROM tbl_name1 LEFT JOIN tbl_name2 USING (a)}; in this
case @code{a} is assumed to come from the @code{tbl_name1} table.
@item
@code{DELETE} and @code{REPLACE} options to the @code{UPDATE} statement
(this will delete rows when a duplicate-key error occurs while updating).
@item
Change the format of @code{DATETIME} to store fractions of seconds.
@item
Make it possible to use the new GNU @code{regexp} library instead of the current
one (the new library should be much faster than the current one).
@end itemize

@item Standards compliance, portability and migration
@itemize @bullet
@item
Don't add automatic @code{DEFAULT} values to columns.  Produce an error for
any @code{INSERT} statement that is missing a value for a column that has no
@code{DEFAULT}.
@item
Add @code{ANY()}, @code{EVERY()}, and @code{SOME()} group functions. In
standard SQL, these work only on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
work on any columns or expressions by treating 0 values as FALSE and non-zero
values as TRUE.
@item
Fix the type of @code{MAX(column)} to be the same as the column type:
@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a DATE);
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NOW());
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT MAX(a) FROM t1;
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM t2;
@end example
@end itemize

@item Speed enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run @code{MyISAM}
recovery at the same time.
@item
Change @code{INSERT ... SELECT} to optionally use concurrent inserts.
@item
Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed
keys if they haven't been used in a while.
@item
Allow join on key parts (optimization issue).
@item
Add a log file analyzer that can parse out information about which tables
are hit most often, how often multiple-table joins are executed, etc.  This
should help users identify areas of table design that could be optimized
to execute much more efficient queries.
@end itemize

@item Internationalization
@itemize @bullet
@end itemize

@item Usability enhancements
@itemize @bullet
@item
Return the original column types when doing
@code{SELECT MIN(column) ... GROUP BY}.
@item
Make it possible to specify @code{long_query_time} with a granularity
in microseconds.
@item
Link the @code{myisampack} code into the server so that it can perform
@code{PACK} or @code{COMPRESS} operations.
@item
Add a temporary key buffer cache during @code{INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE} so that we
can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.
@item
If you perform an @code{ALTER TABLE} on a table that is symlinked to another
disk, create temporary tables on that disk.
@item
Implement a @code{DATE/DATETIME} type that handles time zone information
properly, to make dealing with dates in different time zones easier.
@item
Fix @code{configure} so that all libraries (like @code{MyISAM})
can be compiled without threads.
@item
Allow SQL variables as @code{LIMIT} arguments, for example,
@code{LIMIT @@a,@@b}.
@item
Automatic output from @code{mysql} to a Web browser.
@item
@code{LOCK DATABASES} (with various options).
@item
Many more variables for @code{SHOW STATUS}.  Records reads and
updates.  Selects on a single table and selects with joins.  Mean number of
tables in select. Number of @code{ORDER BY} and @code{GROUP BY} queries.
@item
@code{mysqladmin copy database new-database}; this requires a @code{COPY}
operation to be added to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Processlist output should indicate the number of queries/threads.
@item
@code{SHOW HOSTS} for printing information about the hostname cache.
@item
Change table names from empty strings to @code{NULL} for calculated columns.
@item
Don't use @code{Item_copy_string} on numerical values to avoid
number->string->number conversion in case of:
@code{SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM tbl_name GROUP BY id}
@item
Change so that @code{ALTER TABLE} doesn't abort clients
that execute @code{INSERT DELAYED}.
@item
Fix so that when columns are referenced in an @code{UPDATE} clause,
they contain the old values from before the update started.
@end itemize

@item New operating systems
@itemize @bullet
@item
Port the MySQL clients to LynxOS.
@end itemize

@end table


@node TODO sometime, TODO unplanned, TODO future, TODO
@subsection New Features Planned for the Mid-Term Future

@itemize @bullet
@item
Implement function: @code{get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)}.
@item
Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only
compressed tables use memmap.
@item
Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update
log with @code{SET TIMESTAMP=#;}.
@item
Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.
@item
Simple views (implemented in stepwise fashion up to full functionality).
@xref{ANSI diff Views}.
@item
Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table, or temporary file
gets error 23 (too many open files).
@item
Better constant propagation. When an occurrence of @code{col_name=n}
is found in an expression, for some constant @code{n}, replace other
occurrences of @code{col_name} within the expression with @code{n}.
Currently, this is done only for some simple cases.
@item
Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.
@item
Optimize key = expression comparisons. At the moment only key = field or
key = constant comparisons are optimized.
@item
Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.
@item
Change @file{sql_yacc.yy} to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
better error messages.
@item
Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments
in function.
@item
Use of full calculation names in the order part (for ACCESS97).
@item
@code{MINUS}, @code{INTERSECT}, and @code{FULL OUTER JOIN}.
(Currently @code{UNION} [in 4.0] and @code{LEFT|RIGHT OUTER JOIN} are supported.)
@item
Allow @code{SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#}, for placing a time limit on a query.
@item
Allow updates to be logged to a database.
@item
Enhance @code{LIMIT} to allow retrieval of data from the end of a result set.
@item
Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.
@item
Please note the changes to @code{mysqld_safe}: according to FSSTND (which
Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into @file{/var/run/<progname>.pid}
and log files into @file{/var/log}. It would be nice if you could put the
"DATADIR" in the first declaration of "pidfile" and "log", so the
placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.
@item
Allow a client to request logging.
@item
Allow the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement
to read files that have been compressed with @code{gzip}.
@item
Fix sorting and grouping of @code{BLOB} columns (partly solved now).
@item
Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement
a semaphore library for MIT-pthreads.
@item
Add full support for @code{JOIN} with parentheses.
@item
As an alternative to the one-thread-per-connection model, manage a pool
of threads to handle queries.
@item
Allow @code{GET_LOCK()} to obtain more than one lock.  When doing this, it is
also necessary to handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.

The normal place to report bugs is @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}, which is the
address for our bugs database.
This database is public, and can be browsed and searched by anyone.
If you log into the system, you will also be able to enter new reports.

Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first
time saves time both for us and for yourself.  A good bug report, containing
a full test case for the bug, makes it very likely that we will fix the bug in
the next release.  This section will help you write your report correctly
so that you don't waste your time doing things that may not help us much
or at all.

We encourage everyone to use the @code{mysqlbug} script to generate a bug
report (or a report about any problem).  @code{mysqlbug} can be
found in the @file{scripts} directory (source distribution) and in the 
@file{bin} directory under your MySQL installation directory (binary distribution). 
If you are unable to use @code{mysqlbug} (for example, if you are running 
on Windows), it is still vital that you include all the necessary information 
noted in this section (most importantly a description of the operating system 
and the MySQL version).

The @code{mysqlbug} script helps you generate a report by determining much
of the following information automatically, but if something important is
missing, please include it with your message.  Please read this section
carefully and make sure that all the information described here is included
in your report.

Preferably, you should test the problem using the latest production or
development version of MySQL Server before posting.  Anyone should be
able to repeat the bug by just using '@code{mysql test < script}' on the
included test case or by running the shell or Perl script that is included in the
bug report.

All bugs posted in the bugs database at @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}
will be corrected or documented in the
next MySQL release. If only minor code changes are needed to correct a
problem, we will also post a patch that fixes the problem.

If you have found a sensitive security bug in MySQL, please send an
email to @email{security@@mysql.com}.

If you have a repeatable bug report, please report it to the bugs
database at @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}.  Note that even in this case
it's good to run the @code{mysqlbug} script first to find information
about your system.  Any bug that we are able to repeat has a high chance
of being fixed in the next MySQL release.

To report other problems, you can use one of the MySQL mailing lists.

Remember that it is possible for us to respond to a message containing too much
information, but not to one containing too little.  People often omit facts
because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume that some
details don't matter.  A good principle is: If you are in doubt about stating
something, state it.  It is faster and less troublesome to
write a couple more lines in your report than to wait longer for the answer
if we must ask you to provide information that was missing from the initial
report.

The most common errors made in bug reports are (a) not including the version number of
the MySQL distribution used and (b) not fully describing the platform on which the MySQL server
is installed (including the platform type and version number).  This is highly
relevant information, and in 99 cases out of 100 the bug report is useless without it.  
Very often we get questions like,
``Why doesn't this work for me?'' Then we find that the feature
requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug
described in a report has already been fixed in newer MySQL
versions.  Sometimes the error is platform-dependent; in such cases, it is
next to impossible for us to fix anything without knowing the operating system and
the version number of the platform.

If you compiled MySQL from source,
remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is related to
the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all the time and
become better version by version.  To determine whether your
problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler you use.
Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug and
reported accordingly.

It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included in the
bug report.  That is, give a good example of everything you did that led to
the problem and describe, in exact detail, the problem itself.  The best reports are
those that include a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or
problem.  @xref{Reproduceable test case}.

If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include the
message in your report.  If we try to search for something from the archives
using programs, it is better that the error message reported exactly matches
the one that the program produces.  (Even the case should be observed.)
You should never try to remember what the error message was; instead, copy
and paste the entire message into your report.

If you have a problem with Connector/ODBC (MyODBC), please try to generate a
MyODBC trace file and send it with your report.  @xref{MyODBC bug report}.

Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will
do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples
using the @code{mysql} command-line tool, you should therefore use
the @code{--vertical} option (or the @code{\G} statement terminator)
for output that would exceed the available width for such a display
(for example, with the @code{EXPLAIN SELECT} statement; see the
example later in this section).

@cindex bug reports, criteria for
Please include the following information in your report:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
example, MySQL Version 4.0.12). You can find out which version you
are running by executing @code{mysqladmin version}.  @code{mysqladmin} can be
found in the @file{bin} directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

@item
The manufacturer and model of the machine on which you experience the 
problem.

@item
The operating system name and version.  If you work with Windows, you
can usually get the name and version number by double-clicking your
``My Computer'' icon and pulling down the ``Help/About Windows'' menu.
For most Unix-like operating systems, you can get this information by
executing the command @code{uname -a}.

@item
Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If in doubt,
include these values.

@item
If you are using a source distribution of the MySQL software, the name and
version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a binary
distribution, the distribution name is needed.

@item
If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error
messages and also a few lines of context around the offending code in the
file where the error occurrs.

@item
If @code{mysqld} died, you should also report the query that crashed
@code{mysqld}.  You can usually find this out by running @code{mysqld} with
logging enabled.  @xref{Using log files}.

@item
If a database table is related to the problem, include the output from
@code{mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ...}.  This is very easy
to do and is a powerful way to get information about any table in a database.
The information will help us create a situation matching the one you have.

@item
For speed-related bugs or problems with @code{SELECT} statements, you
should always include the output of @code{EXPLAIN SELECT ...}, and at
least the number of rows that the @code{SELECT} statement produces.  You
should also include the output from @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name}
for each involved table. The more information you give about your
situation, the more likely it is that someone can help you.

The following is an example of a very good bug report. It should be posted
with the @code{mysqlbug} script.  The example uses the @code{mysql}
command-line tool. Note the use of the @code{\G} statement terminator for
statements whose output width would otherwise exceed that of an 80-column
display device.

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES;
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
       <output from SHOW COLUMNS>
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
       <output from EXPLAIN>
mysql> FLUSH STATUS;
mysql> SELECT ...;
       <A short version of the output from SELECT,
       including the time taken to run the query>
mysql> SHOW STATUS;
       <output from SHOW STATUS>
@end example

@item
If a bug or problem occurs while running @code{mysqld}, try to provide an
input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script should include any
necessary source files.  The more closely the script can reproduce your
situation, the better.  If you can make a reproducible test case, you should
post it on @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/} for high-priority treatment.

If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the output
from @code{mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist} in your mail to
provide some information on how your system is performing.

@item
If you can't produce a test case with only a few rows, or if the test table
is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10 rows), you should
dump your tables using @code{mysqldump} and create a @file{README} file
that describes your problem.

Create a compressed archive of your files using
@code{tar} and @code{gzip} or @code{zip}, and use @code{ftp} to transfer the
archive to @uref{ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/}.  Then enter
the problem into our bugs database at @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}.

@item
If you think that the MySQL server produces a strange result from a query,
include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the result
should be, and an account describing the basis for your opinion.

@item
When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the variable names,
table names, etc., that exist in your actual situation than to come up with
new names.  The problem could be related to the name of a variable or table.
These cases are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
After all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your
actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case you have data
you don't want to show to others, you can use @code{ftp} to transfer it to
@uref{ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/}.  If the data is really top
secret and you don't want to show it even to us, then go ahead and provide
an example using other names, but please regard this as the last choice.

@item
Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if possible.  For
example, indicate the options that you use when you start the @code{mysqld}
server as well as the options that you use to run any MySQL client programs.
The options to programs like @code{mysqld} and @code{mysql}, and to the
@code{configure} script, are often keys to answers and are very relevant.
It is never a bad idea to include them.  If you use any modules, such
as Perl or PHP, please include the version numbers of those as well.

@item
If your question is related to the privilege system, please include the
output of @code{mysqlaccess}, the output of @code{mysqladmin reload}, and all
the error messages you get when trying to connect.  When you test your
privileges, you should first run @code{mysqlaccess}.  After this, execute
@code{mysqladmin reload version} and try to connect with the program that
gives you trouble.  @code{mysqlaccess} can be found in the @file{bin}
directory under your MySQL installation directory.

@item
If you have a patch for a bug, do include it.  But don't assume that the patch is
all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide some necessary
information such as test cases showing the bug that your patch fixes.  We
might find problems with your patch or we might not understand it at all; if
so, we can't use it.

If we can't verify exactly what the purpose of the patch is, we won't use it.
Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will handle all the
situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline case (even a rare one)
where the patch won't work, it may be useless.

@item
Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends on
are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things
without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a bug.

@item
Indicate in your bug report that you have checked the reference manual
and mail archive so that others know you have tried to solve the
problem yourself.

@item
If you get a @code{parse error}, please check your syntax closely.  If
you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that your
current version of MySQL Server doesn't support the syntax you are
using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/doc/} doesn't cover the
syntax you are using, MySQL Server doesn't support your query.  In this
case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or email
@email{licensing@@mysql.com} and ask for an offer to implement it.

If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an older version
of MySQL Server, you should check the MySQL change history to see
when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have the option of
upgrading to a newer version of MySQL Server.  @xref{News}.

@item
If your problem is that your data appears corrupt or you get errors
when you access a particular table, you should first check and then try
to repair your tables with @code{CHECK TABLE} and @code{REPAIR TABLE}
or with @code{myisamchk}.
@xref{MySQL Database Administration}.

If you are running Windows, please verify that @code{lower_case_table_names}
is 1 or 2 with @code{SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'lower_case_table_names'}.

@item
If you often get corrupted tables, you should try to find out when and why this
happens.  In this case, the error log in the MySQL data directory
may contain some information about what happened. (This is the file with the
@file{.err} suffix in the name.)  @xref{Error log}.  Please
include any relevant information from this file in your bug report.  Normally
@code{mysqld} should @strong{never} crash a table if nothing killed it in the
middle of an update.  If you can find the cause of @code{mysqld} dying,
it's much easier for us to provide you with a fix for the problem.
@xref{What is crashing}.

@item
If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL Server
and check whether it solves your problem.  All versions of
the MySQL software are thoroughly tested and should work without problems.
We believe in making everything as backward-compatible as possible,
and you should be able to switch MySQL versions without difficulty.

@section MySQL Standards Compliance

@cindex compatibility, with standard SQL
@cindex standards compatibility
@cindex extensions, to standard SQL
@cindex SQL-92, extensions to
@cindex standard SQL, extensions to

This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI/ISO SQL standards.
MySQL Server has many extensions to the SQL standard, and here you
will find out what they are and how to use them.  You will also find
information about functionality missing from MySQL Server, and how to work
around some differences.

Our goal is to not restrict MySQL Server usability for any usage without a
very good reason for doing so.  Even if we don't have the resources to perform
 development for every possible use, we are always willing to help and offer
suggestions to people who are trying to use MySQL Server in new territories.

One of our main goals with the product is to continue to work toward
compliance with the SQL standard, but without sacrificing speed or reliability.
We are not afraid to add extensions to SQL or support for non-SQL
features if this greatly increases the usability of MySQL Server for a large
segment of our user base.
(The @code{HANDLER} interface in MySQL Server 4.0 is an example of this
strategy. @xref{HANDLER, , @code{HANDLER}}.)

We will continue to support transactional and non-transactional
databases to satisfy both mission-critical 24/7 usage and
heavy Web or logging usage.

MySQL Server was originally designed to work with medium size databases
(10-100 million rows, or about 100MB per table) on small computer systems. 
Today MySQL Server handles terabyte-size databases, but the code can also be
compiled in a reduced version suitable for hand-held and embedded devices.
The compact design of the MySQL server makes development in both directions
possible without any conflicts in the source tree.

We are currently not targeting realtime support, though the MySQL
replication capabilities already offer significant functionality.

Database cluster support is planned through integration of our acquired
NDB Cluster technology into a new storage engine, available early 2004.

We are also looking at providing XML support in the database server.

@node Standards, SQL mode, Compatibility, Compatibility
@subsection What Standards MySQL Follows

ODBC levels 0-3.51.

We are aiming toward supporting the full ANSI/ISO SQL standard,
but without making concessions to speed and quality of the code.


@node SQL mode, ANSI mode, Standards, Compatibility
@subsection Selecting SQL Modes

The MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, and can apply these
modes differentially for different clients. This allows applications to
tailor server operation to their own requirements.

Modes define what SQL syntax MySQL should support and what kind of
validation checks it should perform on the data.  This makes it easier
to use MySQL in a lot of different environments and to use MySQL together
with other database servers.

You can set the default SQL mode by starting @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--sql-mode="modes"} option. Beginning with MySQL 4.1, you can also
change the mode after startup time by setting the @code{sql_mode} variable
with a @code{SET [SESSION|GLOBAL] sql_mode='modes'} statement.

For more information on setting the server mode, see @ref{Server SQL mode}.


@node ANSI mode, Extensions to ANSI, SQL mode, Compatibility
@subsection Running MySQL in ANSI Mode

@cindex running, ANSI mode
@cindex ANSI mode, running

You can tell @code{mysqld} to use the ANSI mode with the @code{--ansi}
startup option. @xref{Server options}.

Running the server in ANSI mode is the same as starting it with these options:

@example
--sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE
@end example

In MySQL 4.1, you can achieve the same effect with these two statements:

@example
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SET GLOBAL sql_mode =
  'REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';
@end example

@xref{SQL mode}.

In MySQL 4.1.1, the @code{sql_mode} options shown can be also be set with:

@example
SET GLOBAL sql_mode='ansi';
@end example

In this case, the value of the @code{sql_mode} variable will be set to all
options that are relevant for ANSI mode. You can check the result by doing:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_mode='ansi';
mysql> SELECT @@@@GLOBAL.sql_mode;
        -> 'REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,ANSI'
@end example


@node Extensions to ANSI, Differences from ANSI, ANSI mode, Compatibility
@subsection MySQL Extensions to the SQL Standard

@cindex hints
MySQL Server includes some extensions that you probably will not find in
other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments
of the form @code{/*! ... */}.  In this case, MySQL Server will parse and
execute the code within the comment as it would any other MySQL
statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

@example
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
@end example

If you add a version number after the @code{'!'} character, the syntax within
the comment will be
executed only if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the specified
version number:

@example
CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE t (a INT);
@end example

This means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, MySQL
Server will use the @code{TEMPORARY} keyword.

The following descriptions list MySQL extensions, organized by category.

@table @asis
@item Organization of data on disk

MySQL Server maps each database to a directory under the MySQL
data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database
directory.
This has a few implications:

@cindex database names, case-sensitivity
@cindex table names, case-sensitivity
@cindex case-sensitivity, of database names
@cindex case-sensitivity, of table names

@itemize @bullet

@item
Database names and table names are case sensitive in MySQL Server on
operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix
systems). @xref{Name case sensitivity}.

@item
Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit
(but may not consist solely of digits).

@item
You can use standard system commands to back up, rename, move, delete, and copy
tables that are managed by the @code{MyISAM} or @code{ISAM} storage engines.
For example, to rename a @code{MyISAM} table, rename the @file{.MYD},
@file{.MYI}, and @file{.frm} files to which the table corresponds.
@end itemize

@item General language syntax

@itemize @bullet

@item
Strings may be enclosed by either @samp{"} or @samp{'}, not just by @samp{'}.

@item
Use of @samp{\} as an escape character in strings.

@item
In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases
with the @code{db_name.tbl_name} syntax.  Some SQL servers provide
the same functionality but call this @code{User space}.
MySQL Server doesn't support tablespaces such as used in statements like this:
@code{CREATE TABLE ralph.my_table...IN my_tablespace}.

@item Functions and operators

@itemize @bullet

@item
To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
MySQL Server supports aliases for many functions. For example, all
string functions support both standard SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

@item
MySQL Server understands the @code{||} and @code{&&} operators to mean
logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL Server,
@code{||} and @code{OR} are synonyms, as are @code{&&} and @code{AND}.
Because of this nice syntax, MySQL Server doesn't support
the standard SQL @code{||} operator for string concatenation; use
@code{CONCAT()} instead. Because @code{CONCAT()} takes any number
of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the @code{||} operator to
MySQL Server.

@item
Use of @code{COUNT(DISTINCT list)} where @code{list} has more than one element.

@item
All string comparisons are case-insensitive by default, with sort
ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by
default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with
the @code{BINARY} attribute or use the @code{BINARY} cast, which causes
comparisons to be done using the underlying character code values rather
then a lexical ordering.

A derived table (an unnamed view) is a subquery in the @code{FROM} clause

For MySQL versions older than 4.1, most subqueries can be
rewritten using joins or other methods.

@subsubsection @code{SELECT INTO TABLE}

@findex SELECT INTO TABLE

MySQL Server doesn't support the Sybase SQL extension:
@code{SELECT ... INTO TABLE ...}.  Instead, MySQL Server supports the
standard SQL syntax @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...}, which is basically
the same thing. @xref{INSERT SELECT,  , @code{INSERT SELECT}}.

@example
INSERT INTO tblTemp2 (fldID)
       SELECT tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID
       FROM tblTemp1 WHERE tblTemp1.fldOrder_ID > 100;
@end example

Alternatively, you can use @code{SELECT INTO OUTFILE ...} or
@code{CREATE TABLE ... SELECT}.

From version 5.0, MySQL supports @code{SELECT ... INTO} with user
variables. The same syntax may also be used inside stored procedures using
cursors and local variables.

@cindex @code{InnoDB} tables

@cindex @code{ACID}

MySQL Server (version 3.23-max and all versions 4.0 and above) supports
transactions with the @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB}
transactional storage engines.
@code{InnoDB} provides @emph{full} @code{ACID} compliance.
@xref{Table types}.

The other non-transactional storage engines in MySQL Server (such as
@code{MyISAM}) follow a different paradigm for data integrity called
``@code{Atomic Operations}.'' In transactional terms, @code{MyISAM}
tables effectively always operate in @code{AUTOCOMMIT=1} mode.
Atomic operations often offer comparable integrity with higher performance.

With MySQL Server supporting both paradigms, you can decide whether your
applications are best served by the speed of atomic operations or the use of
transactional features. This choice can be made on a per-table basis.

As noted, the trade off for transactional vs. non-transactional table
types lies mostly in performance. Transactional tables have significantly
higher memory and diskspace requirements, and more CPU overhead.
On the other hand, transactional table types such as @code{InnoDB} also
offer many significant features. MySQL Server's modular design allows the
concurrent use of different storage engines to suit different
requirements and deliver optimum performance in all situations.

But how do you use the features of MySQL Server to maintain rigorous
integrity even with the non-transactional @code{MyISAM} tables, and how
do these features compare with the transactional table types?

@enumerate
@item
If your applications are written in a way that is dependent on being able
to call @code{ROLLBACK} rather than
@code{COMMIT} in critical situations, transactions are more
convenient. Transactions also ensure that unfinished updates or
corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is
given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is
saved.

If you use non-transactional tables,
MySQL Server in almost all cases allows you to resolve potential problems
by including simple checks before updates and by running simple scripts
that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically repair
or warn if such an inconsistency occurs. Note that just by using the
MySQL log or even adding one extra log, you can normally fix tables
perfectly with no data integrity loss.

@item
More often than not, critical transactional updates can be rewritten to be
atomic. Generally speaking, all integrity problems that transactions
solve can be done with @code{LOCK TABLES} or atomic updates, ensuring
that you never will get an automatic abort from the server, which is
a common problem with transactional database systems.

@item
Even a transactional system can lose data if the server goes down.
The difference between different systems lies in just how small the
time-lap is where they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only
``secure enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of
transactional database systems, is reported to sometimes lose data in such
situations.

To be safe with MySQL Server, whether or not using transactional tables, you
only need to have backups and have binary logging turned on. With
this you can recover from any situation that you could with any
other transactional database system.  It is always good to have
backups, independent of which database system you use.
@end enumerate

The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they
can code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary.
However, even if you are new to the atomic operations paradigm, or more
familiar with transactions, do consider the speed benefit that
non-transactional tables can offer on the order of three to five times
the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned transactional tables.

In situations where integrity is of highest importance, MySQL Server offers
transaction-level reliability and integrity even for non-transactional tables.
If you lock tables with @code{LOCK TABLES}, all updates will stall
until any integrity checks are made. If you obtain a @code{READ LOCAL} lock
(as opposed to a write lock) for a table that allows concurrent inserts at the
end of the table, reads are allowed, as are inserts by other clients.
The new inserted records will not be seen by the
client that has the read lock until it releases the lock.
With @code{INSERT DELAYED} you can queue inserts into a local
queue, until the locks are released, without having the client wait
for the insert to complete. @xref{INSERT DELAYED}.

``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only
means that you can be sure that while each specific update is running,
no other user can interfere with it, and there will never be an
automatic rollback (which can happen with transactional tables if you
are not very careful).  MySQL Server also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.

Following are some techniques for working with non-transactional tables:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
@code{LOCK TABLES}, and you don't need cursors to update
records on the fly.

@item
To avoid using @code{ROLLBACK}, you can use the following strategy:

@enumerate
@item
Use @code{LOCK TABLES ...} to lock all the tables you want to access.
@item
Test the conditions that must be true before performing the update.
@item
Update if everything is okay.
@item
Use @code{UNLOCK TABLES} to release your locks.
@end enumerate

This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with
possible rollbacks, although not always. The only situation
this solution doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the
middle of an update. In this case, all locks will be released but some
of the updates may not have been executed.

@item
You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following
techniques:

@itemize @bullet
@item Modify fields relative to their current value.
@item Update only those fields that actually have changed.
@end itemize

For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of
the changed data, or data that depends on the changed data, has changed
compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the
@code{WHERE} clause in the @code{UPDATE} statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: ''Some of the data you have changed
has been changed by another user.'' Then we show the old row versus the new
row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record
to use.

This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually
even better because we only update some of the columns, using values that
are relative to their current values.  This means that typical @code{UPDATE}
statements look something like these:

@example
UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+125;

UPDATE customer
  SET
    customer_date='current_date',
    address='new address',
    phone='new phone',
    money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us-125
  WHERE
    customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';
@end example

As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client
has changed the values in the @code{pay_back} or @code{money_he_owes_us}
columns.

@item
@findex mysql_insert_id()
@findex LAST_INSERT_ID()
In many cases, users have wanted @code{LOCK TABLES} and/or @code{ROLLBACK}
for the purpose of managing unique identifiers.  This can be handled much
more efficiently without locking or rolling back by using an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column and either the SQL function
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} or the C API function @code{mysql_insert_id()}.
@xref{Information functions}.
@xref{mysql_insert_id, , @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

@cindex rows, locking
@cindex locking, row-level
You can generally code around the need for row-level locking. Some situations
really do need it, and @code{InnoDB} tables support row-level locking. With
@code{MyISAM} tables, you can use a flag column in the table and do something
like the following:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;
@end example

MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was
found and @code{row_flag} wasn't already 1 in the original row.

You can think of it as though MySQL Server changed the preceding query to:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID AND row_flag <> 1;
@end example

Stored procedures are implemented in MySQL version 5.0.
@xref{Stored Procedures}.

Triggers are scheduled for implementation in MySQL version 5.1. A trigger is
effectively a type of stored procedure, one that is invoked when a particular
event occurs.
For example, you could set up a stored procedure that is triggered
each time a record is deleted from a transactional table and that stored
procedure automatically deletes the corresponding customer from a customer
table when all their transactions are deleted.


@node ANSI diff Foreign Keys, ANSI diff Views, ANSI diff Triggers, Differences from ANSI
@subsubsection Foreign Keys

@cindex foreign keys
@cindex keys, foreign

In MySQL Server 3.23.44 and up, the @code{InnoDB} storage engine supports
checking of foreign key constraints, including @code{CASCADE}, @code{ON
DELETE}, and @code{ON UPDATE}. @xref{InnoDB foreign key constraints}.

For storage engines other than @code{InnoDB}, MySQL Server parses the
@code{FOREIGN KEY} syntax in @code{CREATE TABLE} statements, but does not
use or store it. In the future, the implementation will be
extended to store this information in the table specification file so that it
may be retrieved by @code{mysqldump} and ODBC.  At a later stage,
foreign key constraints will be implemented for @code{MyISAM} tables as well.

Foreign key enforcement offers several benefits to database developers:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Assuming proper design of the relationships, foreign key constraints
make it more difficult for a programmer to introduce an inconsistency
into the database.

@item
Centralized checking of constraints by the database server makes it
unnecessary to perform these checks on the application side. This
eliminates the possibility that different applications may not all check the
constraints in the same way.

@item
Using cascading updates and deletes can simplify the application code.

@item
Properly designed foreign key rules aid in documenting relationships
between tables.
@end itemize

Do keep in mind that these benefits come at the cost of additional overhead
for the database server to perform the necessary checks. Additional checking
by the server affects performance, which for some applications may be
sufficiently undesirable as to be avoided if possible.
(Some major commercial applications have coded the foreign-key logic at the
application level for this reason.)

MySQL gives database developers the choice of which approach to use. If you
don't need foreign keys and want to avoid the overhead associated with
enforcing referential integrity, you can choose another table type instead,
such as @code{MyISAM}. (For example, the @code{MyISAM} storage engine offers
very fast performance for applications that perform only @code{INSERT} and
@code{SELECT} operations, because the inserts can be performed concurrently
with retrievals.  @xref{Table locking}.)

If you choose not to take advantage of referential integrity checks,
keep the following considerations in mind:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In the absence of server-side foreign key relationship checking, the
application itself must handle relationship issues.  For example, it must
take care to insert rows into tables in the proper
order, and to avoid creating orphaned child records. It must also be able to
recover from errors that occur in the middle of multiple-record insert
operations.

@item
If @code{ON DELETE} is the only referential integrity capability an
application needs, note that as of MySQL Server 4.0, you can use
multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements to delete rows from many
tables with a single statement. @xref{DELETE,  , @code{DELETE}}.

@item
A workaround for the lack of @code{ON DELETE} is to add
the appropriate @code{DELETE} statement to your application when you
delete records from a table that has a foreign key. In practice, this is often
as quick as using foreign keys, and is more portable.

@end itemize

Be aware that the use of foreign keys can in some instances lead
to problems:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Foreign key support addresses many referential integrity
issues, but it is still necessary to design key relationships carefully to avoid
circular rules or incorrect combinations of cascading deletes.

@item
It is not uncommon for a DBA to create a topology of relationships that
makes it difficult to restore individual tables from a backup.
(MySQL alleviates this difficulty by allowing you to temporarily disable
foreign key checks when reloading a table that depends on other tables.
@xref{InnoDB foreign key constraints}.
As of MySQL 4.1.1,
@code{mysqldump} generates dump files that take advantage of this
capability automatically when reloaded.)
@end itemize

Note that foreign keys in SQL are used to check and enforce referential
integrity, not to join tables.  If you want to get results from multiple
tables from a @code{SELECT} statement, you do this by performing a join
between them:

@example
SELECT * FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id = table2.id;
@end example

@xref{JOIN, , @code{JOIN}}. @xref{example-Foreign keys}.

The @code{FOREIGN KEY} syntax without @code{ON DELETE ...} is often used
by ODBC applications to produce automatic @code{WHERE} clauses.


@node ANSI diff Views, ANSI diff comments, ANSI diff Foreign Keys, Differences from ANSI
@subsubsection Views

@cindex views

Views are currently being implemented, and will appear in the 5.0 or 5.1
version of MySQL Server.
Unnamed views (@emph{derived tables}, a subquery in the @code{FROM}
clause of a @code{SELECT}) are already implemented in version 4.1.

Historically, MySQL Server has been most used in applications and on Web
systems where the application writer has full control over database
usage. Usage has shifted over time, and so we find that an
increasing number of users now regard views as an important feature.

Views are useful for allowing users to access a set of relations (tables)
as if it were a single table, and limiting their access to just that.
Views can also be used to restrict access to rows (a subset of a
particular table).
One does not require views to restrict access to columns, as MySQL Server
has a sophisticated privilege system.
@xref{Privilege system}.

Many DBMS don't allow updates to a view. Instead, you have to perform the
updates on the individual tables.
In designing an implementation of views, our goal, as much as is possible
within the confines of SQL, is full compliance with
``@strong{Codd's Rule #6}'' for relational database systems: All views
that are theoretically updatable, should in practice also be updatable.


@node ANSI diff comments,  , ANSI diff Views, Differences from ANSI
@subsubsection @samp{--} as the Start of a Comment

@cindex comments, starting
@cindex starting, comments

Some other SQL databases use @samp{--} to start comments.
MySQL Server uses @samp{#} as the start comment character. You can also use
the C comment style @code{/* this is a comment */} with MySQL Server.
@xref{Comments}.

MySQL Server Version 3.23.3 and above support the @samp{--} comment style,
provided the comment is followed by a space (or by a control character such
as a newline). The requirement for a space is to prevent problems with
automatically generated SQL queries that have used something like the following code, where we automatically insert the value of the payment for
@code{!payment!}:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!
@end example

Think about what happens if the value of @code{payment} is a negative value
such as @code{-1}:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit--1
@end example

@code{credit--1} is a legal expression in SQL, but if @code{--} is interpreted
as the start of a comment, part of the expression is discarded. The result is a
statement that has a completely different meaning than intended:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit
@end example

The statement produces no change in value at all!  This illustrates that
allowing comments to start with @samp{--} can have serious consequences.

Using our implementation of this method of commenting in MySQL Server
Version 3.23.3 and up, @code{credit--1} is actually safe.

Another safe feature is that the @code{mysql} command-line client
removes all lines that start with @samp{--}.


The following information is relevant only if you are running a
MySQL version earlier than 3.23.3:

If you have an SQL program in a text file that contains @samp{--}
comments, you should use the @code{replace} utility as follows to convert the
comments to use @samp{#} characters:

@example
shell> replace " --" " #" < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
         | mysql db_name
@end example

instead of the usual:

@example
shell> mysql db_name < text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
@end example

You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the @samp{--}
comments to @samp{#} comments:

@example
shell> replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
@end example

Change them back with this command:

@example
shell> replace " #" " --" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql
@end example


@node Constraints, Bugs, Differences from ANSI, Compatibility
@subsection How MySQL Deals with Constraints

@findex constraints

MySQL allows you to work with both transactional tables that allow rollback and
non-transactional tables that do not, so constraint handling is
a bit different in MySQL than in other databases.

We have to handle the case when you have updated a lot of rows in a
non-transactional table that cannot roll back when an error occurs.

The basic philosophy is to try to give an error for anything that we can
detect at compile time but try to recover from any errors we get at runtime.
We do this in most cases, but not yet for all. @xref{TODO future}.

The options MySQL has when an error occurs are to stop the statement in the
middle or to recover as well as possible from the problem and continue.

The following sections describe what happens for the different types of
constraints.

@menu
* constraint primary key::      Constraint PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE
* constraint NOT NULL::         Constraint @code{NOT NULL} and @code{DEFAULT} values
* constraint enum::             Constraint @code{ENUM} and @code{SET}
@end menu

@node constraint primary key, constraint NOT NULL, Constraints, Constraints
@subsubsection Constraint PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE

@cindex PRIMARY KEY, constraint
@cindex foreign key, constraint
@cindex UNIQUE, constraint

Normally you will get an error when you try to @code{INSERT} or
@code{UPDATE} a row that causes a primary key, unique key or foreign key
violation.  If you are using a transactional storage engine such as
@code{InnoDB}, MySQL will automatically roll back the transaction.  If you are
using a non-transactional storage engine, MySQL will stop at the incorrect
row and leave any remaining rows unprocessed.

To make life easier, MySQL supports an @code{IGNORE} keyword for
most commands that can cause a key violation (such as @code{INSERT IGNORE}
and @code{UPDATE IGNORE}). In this case, MySQL will ignore any key
violation and continue with processing the next row.  You can get
information about what MySQL did with the @code{mysql_info()} API function.
@xref{mysql_info,  , @code{mysql_info()}}.
In MySQL 4.1 and up, you also can use the @code{SHOW WARNINGS} statement.
@xref{SHOW WARNINGS}.

Note that for the moment only @code{InnoDB} tables support foreign keys.
@xref{InnoDB foreign key constraints}.
Foreign key support in @code{MyISAM} tables is scheduled for implementation
in MySQL 5.1.


@node constraint NOT NULL, constraint enum, constraint primary key, Constraints
@subsubsection Constraint @code{NOT NULL} and @code{DEFAULT} values

@cindex NOT NULL, constraint
@cindex default values, suppression
@cindex suppression, default values

To be able to support easy handling of non-transactional tables all
columns in MySQL have default values. 

If you insert an ``incorrect'' value in a column, such as a @code{NULL} in a
@code{NOT NULL} column or a too-large numerical value in a numerical
column, MySQL sets the column to the ``best possible value''
instead of producing an error.  For numerical values, this is either 0, the
smallest possible value or the largest possible value. For strings, this is
either the empty string or the longest possible string that can be in
the column.

This means that if you try to store @code{NULL} into a column that
doesn't take @code{NULL} values, MySQL Server instead stores 0 or @code{''}
(the empty string). This last behavior can, for single row
inserts, be changed with the @code{-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS} compile
option.) @xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.
This causes @code{INSERT} statements to generate an error unless you
explicitly specify values for all columns that require a non-@code{NULL}
value.

The reason for the preceding rules is that we can't check these conditions
until the query has begun executing.  We can't just roll back if we
encounter a problem after updating a few rows, because the table type may
not support rollback.  The option of terminating the statement is not that
good; in this case, the update would be ``half done,'' which is probably the
worst possible scenario.  In this case it's better to ``do the best you
can'' and then continue as if nothing happened.

This means that you should generally not use MySQL to check column content.
Instead, the application should ensure that is passes only legal values to
MySQL.

In MySQL 5.0, we plan to improve this by providing warnings when automatic
column conversions occur, plus an option to let you roll back statements
that attempt to perform a disallowed column value assignment, as long as the
statement uses only transactional tables.


@node constraint enum,  , constraint NOT NULL, Constraints
@subsubsection Constraint @code{ENUM} and @code{SET}

In MySQL 4.x, @code{ENUM} is not a real constraint, but is a more efficient
way to define columns that can only contain a given set of values.
This is because of the same reasons @code{NOT NULL} is not honored.
@xref{constraint NOT NULL}.

If you insert an incorrect value into an @code{ENUM} column, it will be set to
the reserved enumeration value @code{0}, which will be displayed as an empty
string in string context. @xref{ENUM}.

If you insert an incorrect value into a @code{SET} column, the incorrect value
is ignored. For example, if the column can contain the values
@code{'a'}, @code{'b'}, and @code{'c'}, an attempt to assign @code{'a,x,b,y'}
results in a value of @code{'a,b'}.
@xref{SET}.

@subsubsection Errors in 4.0 Fixed in a Later MySQL Version

The following known errors or bugs are not fixed in MySQL 4.0 because fixing
them would involve changing a lot of code that could introduce other
even worse bugs. The bugs are also classified as ``not fatal'' or
``bearable.''

@itemize @bullet
@item
In a @code{UNION}, the first @code{SELECT} determines the type,
@code{max_length} and @code{NULL} properties for the resulting
columns.  This issue is resolved in MySQL 4.1.1; the property values are based
on the rows from all @code{UNION} parts.
@item
In @code{DELETE} with many tables, one can't refer to tables to be
deleted through an alias. This is fixed in 4.1.
@item
You cannot mix @code{UNION ALL} and @code{UNION DISTINCT} in the same query.
If you use @code{ALL} for one @code{UNION}, it is used for all
of them.
@end itemize

@node Open bugs,  , Errors in 4.0, Bugs
@subsubsection Open Bugs and Design Deficiencies in MySQL

The following problems are known and fixing them is a high priority:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Even if you are using @code{lower_case_table_names=2} (which enables
MySQL to remember the used case for databases and table names) MySQL
will not on case insensitive systems remember the used case for database
names for the function @code{DATABASE()} or in various logs.

@item
Dropping a @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraint doesn't work in replication because
the constraint may have another name on the slave.

@item
@code{REPLACE} (and @code{LOAD DATA} with @code{REPLACE} option) does not
trigger @code{ON DELETE CASCADE}.

@item
@code{DISTINCT} with @code{ORDER BY} doesn't work inside @code{GROUP_CONCAT()}
if you don't use all and only those columns that are in the
@code{DISTINCT} list.

@item
@code{GROUP_CONCAT()} doesn't work with @code{BLOB}/@code{TEXT} columns
when you use @code{DISTINCT} or @code{ORDER BY} inside
@code{GROUP_CONCAT()}. To work around this limitation, use
@code{MID(expr, 1, 255)} instead.

@item
If one user has a long running transaction and another user drops a
table that is updated in the transaction, there is small chance that the
binary log may contain the @code{DROP TABLE} command before the table is
used in the transaction itself.  We plan to fix this in 5.0 by
having the @code{DROP TABLE} wait until the table is not used in any
transaction.

@item
When inserting a big integer value (between 2^63 and 2^64@minus{}1) into a
decimal/string column, it is inserted as a negative value because
the number is evaluated in a signed integer context. It is planned
to be fixed in 4.1.

@item
@code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} does not block @code{CREATE TABLE} or
@code{COMMIT}, which make cause a problem with the binary log position when
doing a full backup of tables and the binary log.

@item
@code{ANALYZE TABLE} on a @code{BDB} table may in some cases make the table
unusable until you restart @code{mysqld}.  If this happens, you will
see errors of the following form in the MySQL error file:

@example
001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log
@end example

@item
MySQL accepts parentheses in the @code{FROM} part of a @code{SELECT}
statement, but silently
ignores them.  The reason for not giving an error is that many clients
that automatically generate queries add parentheses in the @code{FROM}
part even where they are not needed.

@item
Concatenating many @code{RIGHT JOINS} or combining @code{LEFT} and
@code{RIGHT} join in the same query may not give a correct answer as
MySQL only generates @code{NULL} rows for the table preceding a @code{LEFT} or
before a @code{RIGHT} join.  This will be fixed in 5.0 at the same time
we add support for parentheses in the @code{FROM} part.

@item
Don't execute @code{ALTER TABLE} on a @code{BDB} table on which you are
running multiple-statement transactions until all those transactions complete.
(The transaction will probably be ignored.)

@item
@code{ANALYZE TABLE}, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}, and @code{REPAIR TABLE} may
cause problems on tables for which you are using @code{INSERT DELAYED}.

@item
Doing a @code{LOCK TABLE ...} and @code{FLUSH TABLES ...} doesn't
guarantee that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the
table.

@item
@code{BDB} tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many @code{BDB} tables
in a database, it will take a long time to use the @code{mysql} client on
the database if you are not using the @code{-A} option or if you are using
@code{rehash}. This is especially notable when you have a large table cache.

@item
Replication uses query-level logging: The master writes the executed
queries to the binary log. This is a very fast, compact, and efficient
logging method that works perfectly in most cases.
Though we have never heard of it actually occurring, it is theoretically
possible for the data on the master and slave to become different if a
query is designed in such a way that the data modification is
non-deterministic, that is, left to the will of the query optimizer. (That
generally is not a good practice anyway, even outside of replication!)
For example: 

@itemize @minus
@item
@code{CREATE ... SELECT} or
@code{INSERT ... SELECT}  statements that
insert zero or @code{NULL} values into an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.
@item
@code{DELETE} if you are
deleting rows from a table which has foreign keys with @code{ON DELETE
CASCADE} properties.
@item
@code{REPLACE ... SELECT}, 
@code{INSERT IGNORE ... SELECT} if you have
duplicate key values in the inserted data.
@end itemize
@strong{IF and only if all these queries have NO @code{ORDER BY}
clause guaranteeing a deterministic order}.

Indeed, for example for @code{INSERT ... SELECT} with no @code{ORDER
BY}, the @code{SELECT} may return rows in a different order
(which will result in a row having different ranks, hence getting a
different number in the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column),
depending on the choices made by the optimizers on the master and
slave. A query will be optimized differently on the master and slave only if:

@itemize @minus
@item
The files used by the two queries are not exactly the same; for
example @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} was run on the master tables and not on
the slave tables. (To fix this, @code{OPTIMIZE}, @code{ANALYZE}
and @code{REPAIR} are written to the binary log, as of MySQL 4.1.1).
@item
The table is stored using a different storage engine on the master than
on the slave. (It is possible to use different storage engines on the master
and slave. For example, you can use @code{InnoDB} on the master,
but @code{MyISAM} on the slave if the slave has less available disk
space.)
@item
MySQL buffer sizes (@code{key_buffer_size}, etc.) are different on
the master and slave. 
@item
The master and slave run different MySQL versions, and the optimizer
code differs between these versions.
@end itemize

This problem may also affect database restoration using
@code{mysqlbinlog|mysql}.

The easiest way to avoid this problem in all cases is add an
@code{ORDER BY} clause to 
such non-deterministic queries to ensure that the rows are always
stored or modified in the same order. 
In future MySQL versions, we will automatically add an @code{ORDER BY}
clause when needed.

@end itemize

The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Log files are based on hostnames (if you don't specify a file name with
the startup option). For now you have to use options like
@code{--log-bin=old_host_name-bin} if you change your host name to
something else. Another option is to just rename the old files to
reflect your hostname change. @xref{Server options}.

@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} will not delete temporary files left after a
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} command. @xref{mysqlbinlog,  , @code{mysqlbinlog}}.

@item
@code{RENAME} doesn't work with @code{TEMPORARY} tables or tables used in a
@code{MERGE} table.

@item
When using the @code{RPAD()} function in a query that has to be
resolved by using a temporary table, all resulting strings will
have rightmost spaces removed. This is an example of such a query:

@example
SELECT RPAD(t1.column1, 50, ' ') AS f2, RPAD(t2.column2, 50, ' ') AS f1
FROM table1 as t1 LEFT JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.record=t2.joinID
ORDER BY t2.record;
@end example

The final result of this bug is that you will not be able to get spaces on
the right side of the resulting values. The problem also occurs for any other
string function that adds spaces to the right.

The reason for this is due to the fact that @code{HEAP} tables, which are used
first for temporary tables, are not capable of handling @code{VARCHAR} columns.

This behavior exists in all versions of MySQL. 
It will be fixed in one of the 4.1 series releases.

@item
Due to the way table definition files are stored, you cannot use
character 255 (@code{CHAR(255)}) in table names, column names, or enumerations.
This is scheduled to be fixed in version 5.1 when we have new table
definition format files.

@item
When using @code{SET CHARACTER SET}, you can't use translated
characters in database, table, and column names.

@item
You can't use @code{_} or @code{%} with @code{ESCAPE} in @code{LIKE
... ESCAPE}.

@item
If you have a @code{DECIMAL} column with a  number stored in different
formats (+01.00, 1.00, 01.00), @code{GROUP BY} may regard each value
as a different value.

@item
@code{DELETE FROM merge_table} used without a @code{WHERE} clause
will clear only the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables.

@item
You cannot build the server in another directory when using
MIT-pthreads. Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not
likely to fix this. @xref{MIT-pthreads}.

@item
@code{BLOB} values can't ``reliably'' be used in @code{GROUP BY} or
@code{ORDER BY} or @code{DISTINCT}. Only the first @code{max_sort_length}
bytes are used when comparing @code{BLOB} values in these cases.
The default value of @code{max_sort_length} value is 1024. It can be changed
at server startup time.  A workaround for most cases is to use a substring.
For example:
@code{SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name}.

@item
Numeric
calculations are done with @code{BIGINT} or @code{DOUBLE} (both are
normally 64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one
gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with @code{BIGINT}
precision, @code{IF}, and @code{ELT()} with @code{BIGINT} or @code{DOUBLE}
precision and the rest with @code{DOUBLE} precision.  You should try to
avoid using unsigned long long values if they resolve to be bigger than
63 bits (9223372036854775807) for anything other than bit fields.
MySQL Server 4.0 has better @code{BIGINT} handling than 3.23.

@item
All string columns, except @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns, automatically
have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For @code{CHAR} types this
is okay. The bug is
that in MySQL Server, @code{VARCHAR} columns are treated the same way.

@item
You can only have up to 255 @code{ENUM} and @code{SET} columns in one table.

@item
In @code{MIN()}, @code{MAX()}, and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares @code{ENUM} and @code{SET} columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.

@item
@code{mysqld_safe} redirects all messages from @code{mysqld} to the
@code{mysqld} log.  One problem with this is that if you execute
@code{mysqladmin refresh} to close and reopen the log,
@code{stdout} and @code{stderr} are still redirected to the old log.
If you use @code{--log} extensively, you should edit @code{mysqld_safe} to
log to @file{'hostname'.err} instead of @file{'hostname'.log} so you can
easily reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and
executing @code{mysqladmin refresh}.

@item
In the @code{UPDATE} statement, columns are updated from left to right.  If
you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value instead of the
original value. For example:

@example
mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;
@end example

This will increment @code{KEY} by @code{2}, not @code{1}.

@item
You can refer to multiple temporary tables in the same query, but
you cannot refer to any given temporary table more than once.
For example, the following doesn't work:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM temporary_table, temporary_table AS t2;
@end example

@item
The optimizer may handle @code{DISTINCT} differently if you are using
'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are
counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in
normal queries hidden columns don't participate in the @code{DISTINCT}
comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never compare
the hidden columns when executing @code{DISTINCT}.

An example of this is:

@example
SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads
       WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id DESC;
@end example

and

@example
SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id
       FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
       WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9
       AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
       ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;
@end example

In the second case you may in MySQL Server 3.23.x get two identical rows in
the result set (because the values in the hidden @code{id} column may differ).

Note that this happens only for queries where you don't have the
@code{ORDER BY} columns in the result.

@item
Because MySQL Server allows you to work with table types that don't
support transactions, and thus can't roll back data, some things
behave a little differently in MySQL Server than in other SQL servers.
This is just to ensure that MySQL Server never needs to do a rollback
for an SQL statement.  This may be a little awkward at times as column
values must be checked in the application, but this will actually give
you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL Server to do some
optimizations that otherwise would be very hard to do.

If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL Server will, instead of
doing a rollback, store the @code{best possible value} in the column:

@itemize @minus
@item
If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical column,
MySQL Server instead stores the smallest or largest possible value in
the column.

@item
If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number into a
numerical column, MySQL Server stores 0.

@item
If you try to store @code{NULL} into a column that doesn't allow
@code{NULL} values, MySQL Server stores 0 or @code{''} (the empty
string) in it instead. (This behavior can, however, be changed with the
@code{-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS} compile option.)

@item
MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into @code{DATE} and
@code{DATETIME} columns (like @code{'2000-02-31'} or @code{'2000-02-00'}).
The idea is that it's not the job of the SQL server to validate dates. If
MySQL can store a date value and retrieve exactly the same value, MySQL
stores it as given.  If the date is totally wrong (outside the server's
ability to store it), the special date value @code{'0000-00-00'} is stored
in the column instead.

@item
If you set an @code{ENUM} column to an unsupported value, it is set to
the error value @code{empty string}, with numeric value 0.

@item
If you set a @code{SET} column to an unsupported value, the value is ignored.

@end itemize

@item
If you execute a @code{PROCEDURE} on a query that returns an empty set,
in some cases the @code{PROCEDURE} will not transform the columns.

@item
Creation of a table of type @code{MERGE} doesn't check whether the underlying
tables are of compatible types.

@item
MySQL Server can't yet handle @code{NaN}, @code{-Inf}, and @code{Inf}
values in @code{DOUBLE} columns. Using these will cause problems when trying to export
and import data. We should as an intermediate solution change @code{NaN} to
@code{NULL} (if possible) and @code{-Inf} and @code{Inf} to the
minimum respective maximum possible @code{double} value.

@item
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} to first add a @code{UNIQUE} index to a
table used in a @code{MERGE} table and then use @code{ALTER TABLE} to
add a normal index on the @code{MERGE} table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old key that was not unique in the
table. This is because @code{ALTER TABLE} puts @code{UNIQUE} indexes before
normal indexes to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
@end itemize

The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can get a hung thread if you do a @code{DROP TABLE} on a table that is
one among many tables that is locked with @code{LOCK TABLES}.

@item
In the following case you can get a core dump:

@itemize @minus
@item
Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.

@item
@code{LOCK table} with @code{WRITE}.

@item
@code{FLUSH TABLES}.
@end itemize

@item
Before MySQL Server Version 3.23.2 an @code{UPDATE} that updated a key with
a @code{WHERE} on the same key may have failed because the key was used to
search for records and the same row may have been found multiple times:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY > 100;
@end example

A workaround is to use:

@example
mysql> UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 > 100;
@end example

This will work because MySQL Server will not use an index on expressions in
the @code{WHERE} clause.

@item
Before MySQL Server Version 3.23, all numeric types were treated as
fixed-point fields. That means you had to specify how many decimals
a floating-point field should have. All results were returned with the
correct number of decimals.

@subsection Operating Systems Supported by MySQL

@cindex operating systems, supported
@cindex native thread support
@cindex thread support
@cindex process support
@cindex support, for operating systems

This section lists the operating systems on which you can expect to be able to
run MySQL.

We use GNU Autoconf, so it is possible to port MySQL to all modern systems
that have a C++ compiler and a working implementation of POSIX threads.
(Thread suport is needed for the server. To compile only the client code,
the only requirement is a C++ compiler.) We use and develop the software
ourselves primarily on Linux (SuSE and Red Hat), FreeBSD, and Sun Solaris
(Versions 8 and 9).

MySQL has been reported to compile successfully on the following
combinations of operating system and thread package.  Note that for many
operating systems, native thread support works only in the latest versions.

Not all platforms are equally well-suited for running
MySQL. How well a certain platform is suited for a high-load
mission-critical MySQL server is determined by the following
factors:

@itemize @bullet
@item
General stability of the thread library. A platform may have an excellent
reputation otherwise, but MySQL will be only as stable as the thread library
if that library is unstable in the code that is called by MySQL, even if
everything else is perfect.

@item
The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage of
symmetric multi-processor (SMP) systems. In other words, when a process
creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to run on a different
CPU than the original process.

@item
The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many threads which
acquire and release a mutex over a short critical region frequently without
excessive context switches. In other words, if the implementation of
@code{pthread_mutex_lock()} is too anxious to yield CPU time, this will hurt
MySQL tremendously. If this issue is not taken care of, adding extra CPUs
will actually make MySQL slower.

@item
General filesystem stability and performance.

@item
If your tables are big, the ability of the filesystem to deal with large
files at all and to deal with them efficiently.

@item
Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we know
a platform well, we enable platform-specific optimizations and fixes at
compile time. We can also provide advice on configuring your system optimally
for MySQL.

@item
The amount of testing we have done internally for similar configurations.

@item
The number of users who have successfully run MySQL on that
platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the chances of
encountering platform-specific surprises are much smaller.
@end itemize

Based on the preceding criteria, the best platforms for running
MySQL at this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 8.2, 2.4 kernel, and
ReiserFS (or any similar Linux distribution) and SPARC with Solaris
(2.7-9). FreeBSD comes third, but we really hope it will join the top
club once the thread library is improved. We also hope that at some
point we will be able to include into the top category all other platforms
on which MySQL currently compiles and runs okay, but not quite with the
same level of stability and performance.  This will require some
effort on our part in cooperation with the developers of the operating system
and library components that MySQL depends on. If you are interested in
improving one of those components, are in a position to influence its
development, and need more detailed instructions on what MySQL
needs to run better, send an email message to the MySQL internals mailing list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.

Please note that the purpose of the preceding comparison is not to say that
one operating system is better or worse than another in general. We are talking only about
choosing an OS for the specific purpose of running MySQL.  With this in
mind, the result of this comparison would be different if we considered more
factors. And in some cases, the reason one OS is better than the other could
simply be that we have put forth more effort into testing on and optimizing
for that particular platform.  We are just stating our observations to help
you decide which platform to use MySQL in your setup.


@node Which version, Getting MySQL, Which OS, General Installation Issues
@subsection Choosing Which MySQL Distribution to Install

@c TODO: We need to define what a "release" is, i.e., when we assign a new
@c version number a produce distributions that users can grab and install.
@c Also, define "release series", and "distribution" (an installable package).
@c TODO: This needs to describe the Standard/Max/Pro/Classic breakdown
@c TODO: This needs to describe distribution formats as well
@c (.tar.gz, RPM, PKG, .msi)

When preparing to install MySQL, you should decide which version
to use.  MySQL development occurs in several release series, and
you can pick the one that best fits your needs.  After deciding
which version to install, you can choose a distribution format.
Releases are available in binary or source format.

@subsubsection Choosing Which Version of MySQL to Install

The first decision to make is whether you want to use a production (stable)
release or a development release.  In the MySQL development process,
multiple release series co-exist, each at a different stage of maturity:

@itemize @bullet

@item
MySQL 5.0 is the newest development release series and is under very active
development for new features. Until recently it was available only in
preview form from the BitKeeper source repository. An early alpha release
has now been issued to allow more widespread testing.

@item
MySQL 4.1 is a development release series to which major new features have
been added. It is still at alpha status. Sources and binaries are available
for use and testing on development systems.

@item
MySQL 4.0 is the current stable/production-quality release series.
New releases are issued for bugfixes. No new features are added
that could diminish the code stability.

@item
MySQL 3.23 is the old stable/production-quality release series.
This series is retired, so new releases are issued only to fix
critical bugs.

@end itemize

We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves out bug fixes and
things that ``must be done.''  ``Somewhat frozen'' means that we may add
small things that ``almost surely will not affect anything that's already
working.'' Naturally, relevant bugfixes from an earlier series propagate to
later series.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or trying
to port it to some system for which there is no binary distribution, we
recommend going with the production release series. Currently this is MySQL
4.0.  Note that all MySQL releases, even those from development series, are
checked with the MySQL benchmarks and an extensive test suite before being
issued.

@item
If you are running an old system and want to upgrade, but
don't want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you should
upgrade to the latest version in the same release series you are using (where
only the last part of the version number is newer than yours).  We have tried
to fix only fatal bugs and make small, relatively safe changes to that version.

@item
If you want to use new features not present in the production release
series, you can use a version from a development series. Note that
development releases are not as stable as production releases.

@item
If you want to use the very latest sources containing all current patches and
bugfixes, you can use one of our BitKeeper repositories.
These are not ``releases'' as such, but are available as previews of the
code on which future releases will be based.
@end itemize

@cindex naming, releases of MySQL
@cindex releases, naming scheme

The MySQL naming scheme uses release names that consist of three
numbers and a suffix, for example, @code{mysql-4.1.0-alpha}.
The numbers within the release name are is interpreted like this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first number (@code{4}) is the major version and also describes the
file format.  All Version 4 releases have the same file format.

@item
The second number (@code{1}) is the release level.
Taken together, the major version and release level constitute the release
series number.

@item
The third number (@code{0}) is the version number within the
release series.  This is incremented for each new release.  Usually you
want the latest version for the series you have chosen.

@end itemize

For each minor update, the last number in the version string is incremented.
When there are major new features or minor incompatibilities with previous
versions, the second number in the version string is incremented.  When the
file format changes, the first number is increased.

Release names also include a suffix to indicates the stability level of the
release.  Releases within a series progress through a set of suffixes to
indicate how the stability level improves.
The possible suffixes are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{alpha} indicates that the release contains some large section of
new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs (usually there are none)
should be documented in the News section.  @xref{News}.  There are also new
commands and extensions in most alpha releases.  Active development that
may involve major code changes can occur in an alpha release, but everything
will be tested before issuing a release.  For this reason, there should be
no known bugs in any MySQL release.

@item
@code{beta} means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
features that could cause corruption in old code are added.  There should
be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha to beta when there
haven't been any reported fatal bugs within an alpha version for at least
a month and we have no plans to add any features that could make any old
command unreliable.

@item
@code{gamma} is a beta that has been around a while and seems to work fine.
Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many other companies call a release.

@item
If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run for a
while at many different sites with no reports of bugs other than
platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes are applied to the
release. This is what we call a production (stable) release.
@end itemize

MySQL uses a naming scheme that is slightly different from most other products.
In general, it's relatively safe to use any version that has been out for
a couple of weeks without being replaced with a new version within the release
series.

All releases of MySQL are run through our standard tests and
benchmarks to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the
standard tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

@cindex releases, testing
@cindex testing, of MySQL releases

Note that all releases have been tested at least with:

@table @asis
@item An internal test suite
The @file{mysql-test} directory contains an extensive set of test cases.
@c TODO: remove "virtually" when you don't need Cygwin for Windows
We run these tests for virtually every server binary.
See @ref{MySQL test suite} for more information about this test suite.

@item The MySQL benchmark suite
This suite runs a range of common queries.  It is also a test to see whether the
latest batch of optimizations actually made the code faster.
@xref{MySQL Benchmarks}.

@item The @code{crash-me} test
This test tries to determine what features the database supports and what its
capabilities and limitations are.  @xref{MySQL Benchmarks}.
@end table

Another test is that we use the newest MySQL version in our internal
production environment, on at least one machine.  We have more than 100
gigabytes of data to work with.


@node Choosing distribution format, Many versions, Choosing version, Which version
@subsubsection Choosing a Distribution Format

After choosing which version of MySQL to install, you should decide
whether to use a binary distribution or a source distribution.  In
most cases you should probably use a binary distribution, if one
exists for your platform. Binary distributions are available in native format
for many platforms, such as RPM files for Linux or DMG package installers for
Mac OS X. Distributions also are available as Zip archives or compressed
@code{tar} files. 

Reasons to choose a binary distribution include the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Binary distributions generally are easier to install than source distributions.

@c TODO: This makes a false characterization of max vs. non-max as
@c transactional vs. non-transactional.  Replace this with descriptions
@c of Standard/Max/Pro/Classic?

@item
To satisfy different user requirements, we provide two
different binary versions: one compiled with the non-transactional storage
engines (a small, fast binary), and one configured with the most
important extended options like transaction-safe tables.  Both versions
are compiled from the same source distribution.  All native MySQL
clients can connect to both MySQL versions.

The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the
@code{-max} suffix and is configured with the same options as
@code{mysqld-max}. @xref{mysqld-max, , @code{mysqld-max}}.

If you want to use the @code{MySQL-Max} RPM, you must first
install the standard @code{MySQL-server} RPM.

@end itemize

Circumstances under which you probably will be better off with a source
installation include the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  The standard
binary distributions are ``ready to run'' at any place, but you may want
to have even more flexibility to place MySQL components where you want.

@item
You want to configure @code{mysqld} with some extra features that are
not in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the most
common extra options that you may want to use:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{--with-innodb} (default for MySQL 4.0 and onwards)
@item @code{--with-berkeley-db} (not available on all platforms)
@item @code{--with-raid}
@item @code{--with-libwrap}
@item @code{--with-named-z-libs} (This is done for some of the binaries)
@item @code{--with-debug[=full]}
@end itemize

@item
You want to configure @code{mysqld} without some features that are
included in the standard binary distributions. For example,
distributions normally are compiled with support for all character
sets. If you want a smaller MySQL server, you can recompile it with support
for only the character sets you need.

@item
You have a special compiler (like @code{pgcc}) or want to use compiler
options that are better optimized for your processor.  Binary distributions
are compiled with options that should work on a variety of processors from
the same processor family.

@item
You want to use the latest sources from one of the BitKeeper
repositories to have access to all current bugfixes. For example,
if you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL development
team, the bugfix will be committed to the source repository and you
can access it there.  The bugfix will not appear in a release until
a release actually is issued.

@item
You want to read (or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up MySQL. For
this purpose, you should get a source distribution, because the source code
is always the ultimate manual.  Source distributions also contain more tests
and examples than binary distributions.

@subsubsection How and When Updates Are Released

@cindex releases, updating
@cindex updating, releases of MySQL

MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we want to share
new developments with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release
when we have very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended email supported customers
want and try to help them out.

No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  @xref{News}.

We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Releases are issued within each release series. For each release, the last
number in the version is one more than the previous release within the same
series.

@item
Production (stable) releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a year,
but if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes will be issued.

@item
Working releases/bug fixes to old releases are meant to appear about
every 4-8 weeks.

@item
Binary distributions for some platforms are made by us for major releases.
Other people may make binary distributions for other systems, but probably
less frequently.

@item
We usually make fixes available as soon as we have identified and corrected
small or non-critical but annoying bugs. The fixes
are available immediately from our public BitKeeper repositories, and will
be included in the next release.

@item
If by any chance a fatal bug is found in a release, we will make a new
release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies to do this,
too.
@end itemize


@node Release philosophy, MySQL binaries, Many versions, Which version
@subsubsection Release Philosophy---No Known Bugs in Releases

We put a lot of time and effort into making our releases bug free.
To our knowledge, we have not released a single MySQL version with any
@emph{known} ``fatal'' repeatable bugs.
(A fatal bug is something that crashes MySQL under normal usage,
produces incorrect answers for normal queries, or has a security problem.)

We have documented all open problems, bugs, and issues that are
dependent on design decisions.
@xref{Bugs}.

Our aim is to fix everything that is fixable without risk of
making a stable MySQL version less stable. In certain cases, this
means we can fix an issue in the development versions, but not
in the stable (production) version. Naturally, we document such
issues so that users are aware.

Here is a description of how our build process works:
@itemize @bullet
@item
We monitor bugs from our customer support list, the bugs database at
@uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}, and the MySQL external mailing lists.
@item
All reported bugs for live versions are entered into the bugs database.
@item
When we fix a bug, we always try to make a test case for it and
include it into our test system to ensure that the bug will never
recur without being detected. (About 90% of all fixed bugs have a test case.)
@item
We also create test cases for all new features we add to MySQL.
@item
Before we start to build a new MySQL release, we ensure that all
reported repeatable bugs for the MySQL version (3.23.x, 4.0.x, etc)
are fixed.  If something is impossible to fix (due to some internal
design decision in MySQL) we document this in the manual.
@xref{Bugs}.
@item
We do a build on all platforms for which we support binaries (15+
platforms) and run our test suite and benchmark suite on all of them.
@item
We will not publish a binary for a platform for which the test or
benchmark suite fails.  If it's a general error in the source, we fix
this and do the build plus tests on all systems again, from scratch.
@item
The build and test process takes 2-3 days).  If we receive a report regarding
a fatal bug during this process (for example, one that causes
a core dump), we fix the problem and restart the build process.
@item
After publishing the binaries on @uref{http://www.mysql.com/}, we send
out an announcement message to the @code{mysql} and @code{announce} mailing
lists.
@xref{Mailing-list}.
The announcement message contains a list
of all changes to the release and any known problems with the release.
(The ``known problems'' section in the release notes has only been needed
in a handful of releases.)
@item
To quickly give our users access to the latest MySQL features, we do
a new MySQL release every 4-8 weeks.
Source code snapshots are built daily and are available at
@uref{http://downloads.mysql.com/snapshots.php}.
@item
If we, after the release is done, get any bug reports that there was
(after all) anything critically wrong with the build on a specific
platform, we will fix this at once and build a new @code{'a'} release
for that platform. Thanks to our large user base, problems are found
quickly.
@item
Our track record for making good releases is quite good.  In the last
150 releases, we had to do a new build for less than 10 releases (in 3
of these cases, the bug was a faulty @code{glibc} library on one of our build
machines that took us a long time to track down).

@subsubsection MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB

@cindex binary distributions

As a service, we at MySQL AB provide a set of binary distributions
of MySQL that are compiled on systems at our site or on systems where
supporters of MySQL kindly have given us access to their machines. 

In addition to the binaries provided in platform-specific package formats
(see @ref{Quick Standard Installation}), we do offer binary distributions
for a number of platforms in the form of of compressed tar files
(@code{.tar.gz}).

These distributions are generated using the script
@code{Build-tools/Do-compile} which compiles the source code and creates the
binary @code{tar.gz} archive using @code{scripts/make_binary_distribution}.

These binaries are configured and built with the following compilers and
options. This information can also be obtained by looking at the variables
@code{COMP_ENV_INFO} and @code{CONFIGURE_LINE} inside the script
@code{bin/mysqlbug} of every binary tar file distribution.

@node Verifying Package Integrity, Installation layouts, Getting MySQL, General Installation Issues
@subsection  Verifying Package Integrity Using MD5 Checksums or @code{GnuPG}

After you have downloaded the MySQL package that suits your needs and before
you attempt to install it, you should make sure that it is intact and has not
been tampered with.

MySQL AB offers three means of integrity checking:

@itemize @bullet

@item
MD5 checksums

@item
Cryptographic signatures using @code{GnuPG}, the GNU Privacy Guard

@item
For RPM packages, the built-in RPM integrity verification mechanism

@end itemize

The following sections describe how to use these methods.

@subheading Verifying the @code{MD5 Checksum}

After you have downloaded the package, you should make sure that the MD5
checksum matches the one provided on the MySQL download pages. Each package
has an individual checksum that you can verify with the following command,
where @code{package_name} is the name of the package you downloaded:

@example
shell> md5sum package_name
@end example

Note, that not all operating systems support the @code{md5sum} command---on
some it is simply called @code{md5}, others do not ship it at all. On Linux,
it is part of the @code{GNU Text Utilities} package, which is available for
a wide range of platforms. You can download the source code from
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/} as well. If you have
@code{OpenSSL} installed, you can also use the command @code{openssl md5
package_name} instead. A DOS/Windows implementation of the @code{md5} command
is available from @uref{http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/}.

Example:
@example
shell> md5sum mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
60f5fe969d61c8f82e4f7f62657e1f06
                mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
@end example

You should verify that the resulting checksum (the string of hexadecimal
digits) matches the one displayed on
the download page immediately below the respective package.

@subheading Signature Checking Using @code{GnuPG}

Another method of verifying the integrity and authenticity of a package
is to use cryptographic signatures. This is more reliable than using MD5
checksums, but requires more work.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 (February 2003), MySQL AB started signing
downloadable packages with @code{GnuPG} (@code{GNU Privacy Guard}).
@code{GnuPG} is an Open Source alternative to the very well-known
@code{Pretty Good Privacy} (@code{PGP}) by Phil Zimmermann.
See @uref{http://www.gnupg.org/} for more information about @code{GnuPG}
and how to obtain and install it on your system. Most Linux distributions
already ship with @code{GnuPG} installed by default.  For more information
about @code{OpenPGP}, see @uref{http://www.openpgp.org/}.


To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to obtain a
copy of MySQL AB's public GPG build key @email{build@@mysql.com}. You can
either cut and paste it directly from here, or obtain it from
@uref{http://www.keyserver.net/}.

@example
Key ID:
pub  1024D/5072E1F5 2003-02-03
     MySQL Package signing key (www.mysql.com) <build@@mysql.com>
Fingerprint: A4A9 4068 76FC BD3C 4567  70C8 8C71 8D3B 5072 E1F5

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
@end example

You can import this key into your personal public GPG keyring by using
@code{gpg --import}. See the GPG documentation for more info
on how to work with public keys.

After you have downloaded and imported the public build key,
download your desired MySQL package and the corresponding
signature, which also is available from the download page.
The signature file has the same name as the distribution file with an
@file{.asc} extension. For example:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .60
@item Distribution file @tab @code{mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz}
@item Signature file @tab @code{mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc}
@end multitable

Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and then run
the following command to verify the signature for the distribution file:

@example
shell> gpg --verify package_name.asc
@end example

Example:

@example
shell> gpg --verify mysql-standard-4.0.17-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: Signature made Mon 03 Feb 2003 08:50:39 PM MET using DSA key ID 5072E1F5
gpg: Good signature from
     "MySQL Package signing key (www.mysql.com) <build@@mysql.com>"
@end example

The ``Good signature'' message indicates that everything is all right.

@subheading Signature Checking Using @code{RPM}

For RPM packages, there is no separate signature. RPM packages
actually have a built-in GPG signature and MD5 checksum. You can
verify a package by running the following command:

@example
shell> rpm --checksig package_name.rpm
@end example

Example:

@example
shell> rpm --checksig MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm
MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK
@end example

@strong{Note:} If you are using RPM 4.1 and it complains about @code{(GPG)
NOT OK (MISSING KEYS: GPG#5072e1f5)} (even though you have imported it into
your own GPG public keyring), you need to import the key into the RPM
keyring first. RPM 4.1 no longer uses your personal GPG keyring (and GPG
itself), but rather maintains its own keyring (because it's a system-wide
application and a user's GPG public keyring is a user-specific file). To
import the MySQL public key into the RPM keyring, use @code{rpm --import}.

For example, if you have the public key stored in a file named
@file{mysql_pubkey.asc}, import it using this command:

@example
shell> rpm --import mysql_pubkey.asc
@end example

If you notice that the MD5 checksum or GPG signatures
do not match, first try to download the respective package one more time,
perhaps from another mirror site. If you repeatedly cannot successfully
verify the integrity of the package, please notify us about such incidents
including the full package name and the download site you have been using
at @email{webmaster@@mysql.com} or @email{build@@mysql.com}.
Do not report downloading problems using the bug-reporting system.

@cindex installation layouts
@cindex layout of installation
@cindex directory structure, default
@cindex default installation location

This section describes the default layout of the directories created by
installing binary and source distributions.

On Windows, the default installation directory is @file{C:\mysql}, which has
the following subdirectories:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .45
@item @strong{Directory} @tab @strong{Contents of Directory}
@item @file{bin}         @tab Client programs and the @code{mysqld} server
@item @file{data}        @tab Log files, databases
@item @file{Docs}        @tab Documentation
@item @file{examples}    @tab Example programs and scripts
@item @file{include}     @tab Include (header) files
@item @file{lib}         @tab Libraries
@item @file{scripts}     @tab Utility scripts
@item @file{share}       @tab Error message files
@end multitable

Installations created from Linux RPM distributions result in files under
the following system directories:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .45
@item @strong{Directory} @tab @strong{Contents of Directory}
@item @file{/usr/bin}    @tab Client programs
@item @file{/usr/sbin}   @tab @code{mysqld} server
@item @file{/var/lib/mysql} @tab Log files, databases
@item @file{/usr/share/doc/packages} @tab Documentation
@item @file{include}     @tab Include (header) files
@item @file{lib}         @tab Libraries
@item @file{scripts}     @tab @code{mysql_install_db}
@item @file{/usr/share/mysql} @tab Error message and character set files
@item @file{sql-bench}   @tab Benchmarks
@end multitable

On Unix, a @code{tar} file
binary distribution is installed by unpacking it at the installation
location you choose (typically @file{/usr/local/mysql}) and creates the
following directories in that location:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .45
@item @strong{Directory} @tab @strong{Contents of Directory}
@item @file{bin}         @tab Client programs and the @code{mysqld} server
@item @file{data}        @tab Log files, databases
@item @file{docs}        @tab Documentation, ChangeLog
@item @file{include}     @tab Include (header) files
@item @file{lib}         @tab Libraries
@item @file{scripts}     @tab @code{mysql_install_db}
@item @file{share/mysql} @tab Error message files
@item @file{sql-bench}   @tab Benchmarks
@end multitable

A source distribution is installed after you configure and compile it.  By
default, the installation step installs files under @file{/usr/local}, in the
following subdirectories:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .45
@item @strong{Directory} @tab @strong{Contents of Directory}
@item @file{bin}         @tab Client programs and scripts
@item @file{include/mysql}  @tab Include (header) files
@item @file{info}        @tab Documentation in Info format
@item @file{lib/mysql}   @tab Libraries
@item @file{libexec}     @tab The @code{mysqld} server
@item @file{share/mysql} @tab Error message files
@item @file{sql-bench}   @tab Benchmarks and @code{crash-me} test
@item @file{var}         @tab Databases and log files
@end multitable

Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation differs
from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{mysqld} server is installed in the @file{libexec}
directory rather than in the @file{bin} directory.

@item
The data directory is @file{var} rather than @file{data}.

@item
@code{mysql_install_db} is installed in the @file{bin} directory
rather than in the @file{scripts} directory.

@item
The header file and library directories are @file{include/mysql} and
@file{lib/mysql} rather than @file{include} and @file{lib}.
@end itemize

You can create your own binary installation from a compiled source
distribution by executing the @file{scripts/make_binary_distribution} script
from the top directory of the source distribution.

platform. (This is also known as performing a ``binary install.'')
However, binary distributions of MySQL are available for many
other platforms as well. See @ref{Installing binary} for generic
installation instructions for these packages that apply to all platforms.

See @ref{General Installation Issues} for more information on what other binary

To run MySQL on Windows, you need the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A 32-bit Windows operating system such as 9x, Me, NT, 2000, or XP.
The NT family (Windows NT, 2000, and XP) permits you to run the MySQL server

@item
TCP/IP protocol support.

@item
A copy of the MySQL binary distribution for Windows, which
can be downloaded from @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}.

Note: The distribution files are supplied with a zipped format
and we recommend the use of an adequate FTP client with resume
feature to avoid corruption of files during the download process.

@item
A @code{ZIP} program to unpack the distribution file.

@item
Enough space on the hard drive to unpack, install, and create the
databases in accordance with your requirements.

@item
If you plan to connect to the MySQL server via ODBC, you
also need the @code{MyODBC} driver. @xref{ODBC}.

@item
If you need tables with a size larger than 4GB, install MySQL
on an NTFS or newer filesystem. Don't forget to use @code{MAX_ROWS} and
@code{AVG_ROW_LENGTH} when you create tables.

@subsubsection Installing a Windows Binary Distribution

To install MySQL on Windows using a binary distribution, follow this
procedure:

@enumerate

@item
If you are working on a Windows NT, 2000, or XP machine, make sure that you have
logged in as a user with administrator privileges.

@c TODO: omit this "upgrade" stuff, defer it to the upgrading section?

@item
If you are doing an upgrade of an earlier MySQL installation,
it is necessary to stop the current server.
On Windows NT, 2000, or XP machines, if you are running the server
as a Windows service, stop it as follows from the command prompt:

@example
C:\> NET STOP MySQL
@end example

If you plan to use a different server after the upgrade (for example,
if you want to run @code{mysqld-max} rather than @code{mysqld}),
remove the existing service:

@example
C:\mysql\bin> mysqld --remove
@end example

You can reinstall the service to use the proper server after upgrading.

If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, stop it like this:

@example
C:\mysql\bin> mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

@item
Exit the @code{WinMySQLAdmin} program if it is running.

@item
Unzip the distribution file to a temporary directory.

@item
Run the @code{setup.exe} program to begin the installation process.
If you want to install MySQL into a location other than the default directory
(@file{C:\mysql}), use the @code{Browse} button to specify your
preferred directory. If you do not install MySQL into the default location,
you will need to specify the location whenever you start the server. The
easiest way to do this is to use an option file, as described in
@ref{Windows prepare environment}.

@item
Finish the install process.

@end enumerate

@strong{Important note:}
Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1 do not contain any
installer program.  A 4.1 distribution is a ZIP file that you just
unzip in the location where you want to install MySQL. For example,
to install @file{mysql-4.1.1-alpha-win.zip} as @file{C:\mysql}, unzip
the distribution file on the @code{C:} drive, then rename the resulting
@file{mysql-4.1.1-alpha} directory to @file{mysql}.

If you are upgrading to MySQL 4.1 from an earlier version, you will want to
preserve your existing @file{data} directory that contains the grant tables
in the @code{mysql} database and your own databases.  Before installing 4.1,
stop the server if it is running, and save your @file{data} directory to
another location. Then either rename the existing @file{C:\mysql} directory
or remove it.  Install 4.1 as described in the preceding paragraph, and then
replace its @file{data} directory with your old @file{data} directory.
Start the new server and update the grant tables.  This will avoid loss of
your current databases.

@subsubsection Preparing the Windows MySQL Environment

If you need to specify startup options when you run the server,
you can indicate them on the command line or place them in an option
file. For options that will be used every time the server starts,
you will find it most convenient to use an option file to specify
your MySQL configuration. This is true particularly under the
following circumstances:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The installation or data directory locations are different from the default
locations (@file{C:\mysql} and @file{C:\mysql\data}).

@item
You need to tune the server settings.
For example, to use the @code{InnoDB} transactional tables in
MySQL version 3.23, you
must manually create two new directories to hold the @code{InnoDB}
data and log files---such as, @file{C:\ibdata} and @file{C:\iblogs}.
You will also need to add some extra lines to the option
file, as described in @ref{InnoDB configuration, , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.
(As of MySQL 4.0, @code{InnoDB} creates its data files and log files in the data
directory by default. This means you need not configure @code{InnoDB} explicitly.
You may still do so if you wish, and an option file will be useful in this
case, too.)

@end itemize

On Windows, the MySQL installer places the data directory directly under
the directory where you install MySQL.  If you would like to use a data
directory in a different location, you should copy the entire contents
of the @file{data} directory to the new location. For example, by default, the
installer
places MySQL in @file{C:\mysql} and the data directory in
@file{C:\mysql\data}. If you want to use a data directory of @file{E:\mydata},
you must do two things:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Move the data directory from @file{C:\mysql\data} to @file{E:\mydata}.

@item
Use a @code{--datadir} option to specify the new data directory location
each time you start the server.

@end itemize

When the MySQL server starts on Windows, it looks for options in
two files:  The @file{my.ini} file in the Windows directory, and
the @file{C:\my.cnf} file.  The Windows directory typically is
named something like @file{C:\WINDOWS} or @file{C:\WinNT}.  You
can determine its exact location from the value of the @code{WINDIR}
environment variable using the following command:

@example
C:\> echo %WINDIR%
@end example

MySQL looks for options first in the @file{my.ini} file, then in
the @file{my.cnf} file.  However, to avoid confusion, it's best if
you use only one file.  If your PC uses a boot loader where the
@code{C:} drive isn't the boot drive, your only option is to use
the @file{my.ini} file.  Whichever one you use, it must be a plain
text file.

An option file can be created and modified with any text editor,
such as the @code{Notepad} program.  For example, if MySQL is
installed at @file{D:\mysql} and the data directory is located as
@file{D:\mydata\data}, you can create the option file and set up
a @code{[mysqld]} section to specify values for the @code{basedir}
and @code{datadir} parameters:

@example
[mysqld]
# set basedir to your installation path
basedir=D:/mysql
# set datadir to the location of your data directory
datadir=D:/mydata/data
@end example

Note that Windows pathnames are specified in option files using
forward slashes rather than backslashes.  If you do use backslashes,
you must double them.

Another way to manage an option file is to use the @code{WinMySQLAdmin}
tool. You can find @code{WinMySQLAdmin} in the @file{bin} directory
of your MySQL installation, as well as a help file containing
instructions for using it. @code{WinMySQLAdmin} has the capability
of editing your option file, but note these points:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{WinMySQLAdmin} uses only the @file{my.ini} file.

@item
If @code{WinMySQLAdmin} finds a @file{C:\my.cnf} file, it will in fact rename
it to @file{C:\my_cnf.bak} to disable it.

@end itemize

Now you are ready to test starting the server.


@node Windows select server, Windows server first start, Windows prepare environment, Windows installation
@subsubsection Selecting a Windows Server

Starting with MySQL 3.23.38, the Windows distribution includes
both the normal and the MySQL-Max server binaries.
Here is a list of the different MySQL servers from which you can choose:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{Binary} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{mysqld} @tab Compiled with full debugging and automatic memory allocation checking, symbolic links, and @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB} tables.
@item @code{mysqld-opt} @tab Optimized binary.  From version 4.0 on, @code{InnoDB} is enabled.  Before 4.0, this server includes no transactional table support.
@item @code{mysqld-nt} @tab Optimized binary for NT, 2000, and XP with support for named pipes.
@item @code{mysqld-max} @tab Optimized binary with support for symbolic links, and @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB} tables.
@item @code{mysqld-max-nt} @tab Like @code{mysqld-max}, but compiled with support for named pipes.
@end multitable

All of the preceding binaries are optimized for modern Intel processors
but should work on any Intel i386-class or higher processor.

@cindex TCP/IP
@cindex named pipes

MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms. The @code{mysqld-nt}
and @code{mysql-max-nt} servers support named pipes on NT, 2000, and XP.
However, the default is to use TCP/IP regardless of the platform.
(Named pipes are slower than TCP/IP in many Windows configurations.)

Named pipe use is subject to these conditions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only
if you start the server with the @code{--enable-named-pipe} option.
It is now necessary to use this option explicitly because some users have
experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when named pipes
are used.

@item
Named pipe connections are allowed only by the
@code{mysqld-nt} or @code{mysqld-max-nt} servers, and only if the server is
run on a version of Windows that supports named pipes (NT, 2000, XP).

@item
These servers can be run on Windows 98 or Me, but only if TCP/IP is installed;
named pipe connections cannot be used.

@item
On Windows 95, these servers cannot be used.

@end itemize

@node Windows server first start, Win95 start, Windows select server, Windows installation
@subsubsection Starting the Server for the First Time

On Windows 95, 98, or Me, MySQL clients always connect to the server using
TCP/IP.  (This will allow any machine on your network to connect to your MySQL
server.)  Because of this, you must make sure that TCP/IP support is installed
on your machine before starting MySQL.  You can find TCP/IP on your
Windows CD-ROM.

Note that if you are using an old Windows 95 release (for example,
OSR2), it's likely that you have an old Winsock package;
MySQL requires Winsock 2! You can get the newest Winsock from
@uref{http://www.microsoft.com/}.  Windows 98 has the new Winsock 2
library, so it is unnecessary to update the library.

On NT-based systems such as Windows NT, 2000, or XP, clients have two
options. They can use TCP/IP, or they can use a named pipe if the server
supports named pipe connections.

@c TODO: Mention shared memory connections for 4.1.

For information about which server binary to run, see
@ref{Windows prepare environment}.

This section gives a general overview of starting the MySQL server.
The following sections provide more specific information for particular
versions of Windows.

The examples in these sections assume that MySQL is installed under the default
location of @file{C:\mysql}. Adjust the pathnames shown in the examples if you
have MySQL installed in a different location.

Testing is best done from a command prompt in a console window (a ``DOS
window''). This way you can have the server display status messages in the
window where they are easy to see.  If something is wrong with your
configuration, these messages will make it easier for you to identify
and fix any problems.

Make sure that you are in the directory where the server is located, then
enter this command:

@example
C:\mysql\bin> mysqld --console
@end example

For servers that include @code{InnoDB} support,
you should see the following messages as the server starts:

@example
InnoDB: The first specified datafile c:\ibdata\ibdata1 did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file c:\ibdata\ibdata1 size to 209715200
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 did not exist: new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile0 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 did not exist: new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile1 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 did not exist: new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file c:\iblogs\ib_logfile2 size to 31457280
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer not found: creating new
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer created
InnoDB: creating foreign key constraint system tables
InnoDB: foreign key constraint system tables created
011024 10:58:25  InnoDB: Started
@end example

When the server finishes its startup sequence, you should see something
like this, which indicates that the server is ready to service client
connections:

@example
mysqld: ready for connections
Version: '4.0.14-log'  socket: ''  port: 3306
@end example

The server will continue to write to the console any further diagnostic
output it produces.  You can open a new console window in which to run
client programs.

If you omit the @code{--console} option, the server writes diagnostic output
to the error log in the data directory. The error log is the file with the
@file{.err} extension.

The accounts that are listed in the MySQL grant tables initially have no
passwords.  After starting the server, you should set up passwords for
them using the instructions in @ref{Post-installation}.


@node Win95 start, NT start, Windows server first start, Windows installation
@subsubsection Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line

The MySQL server can be started manually from the command line.
This can be done on any version of Windows.

To start the @code{mysqld} server from the command line, you should
start a console window (a ``DOS'' window) and enter this command:

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld
@end example

On non-NT versions of Windows, this will start @code{mysqld} in the
background. That is, after the server starts, you should see another
command prompt. If you start the server this way on Windows NT, 2000, or XP,
the server will run in the foreground and no command prompt will appear
until the server exits.  Because of this, you should open another console
window to run client programs while the server is running.

You can stop the MySQL server by executing this command:

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

This invokes the MySQL administrative utility @code{mysqladmin} to
connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command connects
as @code{root}, which is the default administrative account in the
MySQL grant system. Please note that users in the MySQL grant system
are wholly independent from any login users under Windows.

If @code{mysqld} doesn't start, check the error log to see whether the
server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the problem.
The error log is located in the @file{C:\mysql\data} directory. It is
the file with a suffix of @file{.err}. You can also try to start the
server as @code{mysqld --console}; in this case, you may get some useful
information on the screen that may help solve the problem.

The last option is to start @code{mysqld} with
@code{--standalone --debug}.
In this case @code{mysqld} will write a log file
@file{C:\mysqld.trace} that should contain the reason why
@code{mysqld} doesn't start. @xref{Making trace files}.

Use @code{mysqld --help} to display all the options that
@code{mysqld} understands!


@node NT start, Windows running, Win95 start, Windows installation
@subsubsection Starting MySQL as a Windows Service

On the NT family (Windows NT, 2000, or XP), the recommended way to run MySQL
is to install it as a Windows service. Then Windows starts and stops the MySQL
server automatically when Windows starts and stops. A server installed as a
service can also be controlled from the command line using @code{NET}
commands, or with the graphical @code{Services} utility.

The @code{Services} utility (the Windows
@code{Service Control Manager}) can be found in the Windows
@code{Control Panel} (under @code{Administrative Tools}
on Windows 2000). It is advisable to close the @code{Services} utility
while performing server installation or removal operations from this command
line.  This prevents some odd errors.

To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on Windows NT 4, you must install
service pack 3 (or newer)!

Before installing MySQL as a Windows service, you should first stop
the current server if it is running by using the following command:

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

This invokes the MySQL administrative utility @code{mysqladmin} to
connect to the server and tell it to shut down. The command connects
as @code{root}, which is the default administrative account in the
MySQL grant system. Please note that users in the MySQL grant system
are wholly independent from any login users under Windows.

Now install the server as a service:

@example
shell> mysqld --install
@end example

If you have problems installing @code{mysqld} as a
service using just the server name, try installing it using its full pathname:

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install
@end example

@c I commented this out because no instructions were given how to "fix"
@c the path. -- PD
@c If that doesn't work, you can get @code{mysqld} to
@c start properly by fixing the path in the registry!

As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can specify a specific service name after the
@code{--install} option.  As of MySQL 4.0.3, you can in addition specify a
@code{--defaults-file} option after the service name to indicate where the
server should obtain options when it starts. The rules that determine the
service name and option files the server uses are as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you specify no service name, the server uses the default service name of
@code{MySQL} and the server reads options from the @code{[mysqld]} group in
the standard option files.

@item
@c TODO change this back after bug gets fixed
@c If you specify a service name different than @code{MySQL} after the
If you specify a service name after the
@code{--install} option, the server ignores the @code{[mysqld]} option
group and instead reads options from the group that has the same name as the
service. The server reads options from the standard option files.

@c TODO preceding item is different for 4.0.17 on? ([mysqld] group is
@c read by all servers, even if installed with a non-default service name?)

@item
If you specify a @code{--defaults-file} option after the service name,
the server ignores the standard option files and reads options only from the
@code{[mysqld]} group of the named file.

@end itemize

@strong{Note:} Prior to MySQL 4.0.17, a server installed as a Windows
service has problems starting if its pathname or the service name contains
spaces. For this reason, avoid installing MySQL in a directory such as
@file{C:\Program Files} or using a service name containing spaces.

In the usual case that you install the server with @code{--install}
but no service name, the server is installed with a service
name of @code{MySQL}.

As a more complex example, consider the following command (which should be
entered on a single line):

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install mysql
           --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf
@end example

Here, a service name is given after the @code{--install} option. If no
@code{--defaults-file} option had been given, this command would have the
effect of causing the server to read the @code{[mysql]} group from the
standard option files. (This would be a bad idea, because that option group
is for use by the @code{mysql} client program.) However, because the
@code{--defaults-file} option is present, the server reads options only from
the named file, and only from the @code{[mysqld]} option group.

You can also specify options as ``@code{Start parameters}'' in the
Windows @code{Services} utility before you start the MySQL service.

Once a MySQL server is installed as a service, Windows will start
the service automatically whenever Windows starts.  The service also
can be started immediately from the @code{Services} utility, or by
using the command @code{NET START MySQL}.  The @code{NET} command
is not case sensitive.

Please note that when run as a service, @code{mysqld} has no access
to a console window, so no messages can be seen there.  If
@code{mysqld} doesn't start, check the error log to see whether the
server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the problem.
The error log is located in the @file{C:\mysql\data} directory. It
is the file with a suffix of @file{.err}.

When @code{mysqld} is running as a service, it can be stopped by
using the @code{Services} utility, the command @code{NET STOP
MySQL}, or the command @code{mysqladmin shutdown}. If the service
is running when Windows shuts down, Windows will stop the server
automatically.

From MySQL version 3.23.44, you have the choice of installing the
server as a @code{Manual} service if you don't wish the service to
be started automatically during the boot process. To do this, use
the @code{--install-manual} option rather than the @code{--install}
option:

@example
shell> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --install-manual
@end example

To remove a server that is installed as a service, first stop it if it is
running. Then use the @code{--remove} option to remove it:

@example
shell> mysqld --remove
@end example

For MySQL versions older than 3.23.49, one problem with automatic
MySQL service shutdown is that Windows waited only for a few
seconds for the shutdown to complete, then killed the database
server process if the time limit was exceeded. This had the potential
to cause problems.  (For example, the @code{InnoDB} storage engine
had to perform crash recovery at the next startup.) Starting from
MySQL version 3.23.49, Windows waits longer for the MySQL server
shutdown to complete. If you notice this still is not enough for
your installation, it is safest not to run the MySQL server as a
service. Instead, start it from the command-line prompt, and stop
it with @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.

This change to tell Windows to wait longer when stopping the MySQL server
works for Windows 2000 and XP. It does not work for Windows NT, where Windows
waits only 20 seconds for a service to shut down, and after that kills the
service process. You can increase this default by opening the Registry
Editor @file{\winnt\system32\regedt32.exe} and editing the value of
@code{WaitToKillServiceTimeout} at
@code{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control}
in the Registry tree. Specify the new larger value in milliseconds.
For example, the value 120000 tells Windows NT to wait up to 120 seconds.

If you don't want to start @code{mysqld} as a service, you can
start it from the command line the same way as for versions of
Windows that are not based on NT.  For instructions, see @ref{Win95
start}.

@node Windows running, Windows vs Unix, NT start, Windows installation
@subsubsection Running MySQL Client Programs on Windows

@cindex TCP/IP
@cindex named pipes

You can test whether the MySQL server is working by executing any of the
following commands:

@example
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql test
@end example

If @code{mysqld} is slow to respond to TCP/IP connections from client programs
on Windows 9x/Me, there is
probably a problem with your DNS.  In this case, start @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--skip-name-resolve} option and use only @code{localhost} and IP
numbers in the @code{Host} column of the MySQL grant tables.

You can force a MySQL client to use a named pipe connection rather than TCP/IP
 by specifying the
@code{--pipe} option or by specifying @code{.} (period) as the host
name.  Use the @code{--socket} option to specify the name of the
pipe.  In MySQL 4.1, you should use the @code{--protocol=PIPE}
option.

There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{Binary} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{mysql} @tab Compiled on native Windows, offering limited text editing capabilities.
@item @code{mysqlc} @tab Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries, which offers @code{readline} editing.
@end multitable

If you want to use @code{mysqlc}, you must have a copy of the
@file{cygwinb19.dll} library installed somewhere that @code{mysqlc}
can find it. Current distributions of MySQL include this library
in the same directory as @code{mysqlc} (the @file{bin} directory
under the base directory of your MySQL installation). If your
distribution does not have the @code{cygwinb19.dll} library in the
@file{bin} directory, look for it in the @code{lib} directory and
copy it to your Windows system directory
(@file{\Windows\system} or similar place).

@c TODO: check whether it needs to be in the *system* directory, or if it can
@c be in the Windows directory.


@node Windows vs Unix,  , Windows running, Windows installation
@subsubsection MySQL on Windows Compared to MySQL on Unix

@cindex Windows, versus Unix
@cindex operating systems, Windows versus Unix

MySQL for Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. The Windows
version of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding Unix version,
with the following exceptions:

@table @strong
@item Windows 95 and threads
Windows 95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread creation.
Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you shouldn't
run @code{mysqld} for an extended time on Windows 95 if your server handles
many connections!  Other versions of Windows don't suffer from this bug.

@item Limited number of ports
Windows systems have about 4,000 ports available for client connections, and
after a connection on a port closes, it takes two to four minutes before the
port can be reused.  In situations where clients connect to and disconnect
from the server at a high rate, it is possible for all available ports to be
used up before closed ports become available again. If this happens, the
MySQL server will appear to have become unresponsive even though it is
running.  Note that ports may be used by other applications running on the
machine as well, in which case the number of ports available to MySQL is
lower.

@item Concurrent reads
MySQL depends on the @code{pread()} and @code{pwrite()} calls to be
able to mix @code{INSERT} and @code{SELECT}.  Currently we use mutexes
to emulate @code{pread()}/@code{pwrite()}.  We will, in the long run,
replace the file level interface with a virtual interface so that we can
use the @code{readfile()}/@code{writefile()} interface on NT, 2000, and XP to
get more speed.
The current implementation limits the number of open files MySQL
can use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to run as many
concurrent threads on NT, 2000, and XP as on Unix.

@item Blocking read
MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection, which
has the following implications:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A connection will not be disconnected automatically after eight hours, as
happens with the Unix version of MySQL.

@item
If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without killing
MySQL.

@item
@code{mysqladmin kill} will not work on a sleeping connection.

@item
@code{mysqladmin shutdown} can't abort as long as there are sleeping
connections.
@end itemize

We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have figured out a
nice workaround.

@item @code{DROP DATABASE}
You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

@item Killing MySQL from the Task Manager
You can't kill MySQL from the Task Manager or with the shutdown
utility in Windows 95.  You must take it down with @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.

@item Case-insensitive names
Filenames are not case sensitive on Windows, so MySQL database and table names
are also not case sensitive on Windows.  The only
restriction is that database and table names must be specified using the same
case throughout a given statement.  @xref{Name case sensitivity}.

@item The @samp{\} pathname separator character
Pathname components in Windows 95 are separated by the @samp{\} character,
which is also the escape character in MySQL.  If you are using @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} or @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE},
use Unix style filenames with @samp{/} characters:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' INTO TABLE skr;
mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;
@end example

Alternatively, you must double the @samp{\} character:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' INTO TABLE skr;
mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;
@end example

@item Problems with pipes.
Pipes don't work reliably from the Windows command-line prompt.  If the
pipe includes the character @code{^Z} / @code{CHAR(24)}, Windows will think it
has encountered end-of-file and abort the program.

This is mainly a problem when you try to apply a binary log as follows:

@example
C:\> mysqlbinlog binary-log-name | mysql --user=root
@end example

If you get a problem applying the log and suspect it's because of an @code{^Z}
/ @code{CHAR(24)} character you can use the following workaround:

@example
C:\> mysqlbinlog binary-log-file --result-file=/tmp/bin.sql
C:\> mysql --user=root --execute "source /tmp/bin.sql"
@end example

The latter command also can be used to reliably read in any SQL file
that may contain binary data.

@item @code{Can't open named pipe} error
If you use a MySQL Version 3.22 server on NT with the newest MySQL client
programs, you will get the following error:

@example
error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...
@end example

@tindex .my.cnf file
This happens because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT
by default.  You can avoid this error by using the @code{--host=localhost}
option to the new MySQL clients or create an option file
@file{C:\my.cnf} that contains the following information:

@example
[client]
host = localhost
@end example

Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are enabled only if @code{mysqld-nt} or
@code{mysqld-max-nt} is started with @code{--enable-named-pipe}.

@item @code{Access denied for user} error
If you attempt to run a MySQL client program to connect to a server
running on the same machine, but get the error @code{Access denied
for user: 'some-user@@unknown' to database 'mysql'}, this means
that MySQL can't resolve your hostname properly.

To fix this, you should create a file @file{\windows\hosts} with the
following information:

@example
127.0.0.1       localhost
@end example

@item @code{ALTER TABLE}
While you are executing an @code{ALTER TABLE} statement, the table is locked
from being used by other threads.  This has to do with the fact that on Windows,
you can't delete a file that is in use by another threads.  In the future,
we may find some way to work around this problem.

@item @code{DROP TABLE}
@code{DROP TABLE} on a table that is in use by a @code{MERGE} table will
not work on Windows because the @code{MERGE} handler does the table mapping
hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow you
to drop files that are open, you first must flush all @code{MERGE}
tables (with @code{FLUSH TABLES}) or drop the @code{MERGE} table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
views.

@item @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX DIRECTORY}
The @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} options for
@code{CREATE TABLE} are ignored on Windows, because Windows doesn't support
symbolic links.  These options also are ignored on systems that have a
non-functional @code{realpath()} call.
@end table

Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us improve MySQL
on Windows:

@cindex Windows, open issues

@itemize @bullet
@c PD: Commented this one out as obsolete until I hear otherwise
@c @item
@c Make a single-user @code{MYSQL.DLL} server.  This should include everything in
@c a standard MySQL server, except thread creation.  This will make

@c client/server and don't need to access the server from other hosts.

@item
Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

@item
It would be really nice to be able to kill @code{mysqld} from the Task Manager.
For the moment, you must use @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.

@item
Port @code{readline} to Windows for use in the @code{mysql} command-line tool.

@item
GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (@code{mysql},
@code{mysqlshow}, @code{mysqladmin}, and @code{mysqldump}) would be nice.

@item
It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in @file{net.c} were
interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open threads with
@code{mysqladmin kill} on Windows.

@item
Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement methods
provided by Windows.

@subsection Installing MySQL on Linux

@cindex RPM file
@cindex RPM Package Manager
@cindex installing, Linux RPM packages

The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using the RPM
packages. The MySQL RPMs are currently built on a SuSE Linux 7.3
system but should work on most versions of Linux that support @code{rpm}
and use @code{glibc}.

@strong{Note:} RPM distributions of MySQL often are provided by other
vendors.  Be aware that they may differ in features and capabilities from
those built by MySQL AB, and that the instructions in this manual do not
necessarily apply to installing them. The vendor's instructions should be
consulted instead.

If you have problems with an RPM file (for example, if you receive the error
``@code{Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up}''), see
@ref{Binary notes-Linux}.

In most cases, you only need to install the @code{MySQL-server} and
@code{MySQL-client} packages to get a functional MySQL installation. The
other packages are not required for a standard installation.
If you want to run a MySQL-Max server that has additional capabilities,
you should install the @code{MySQL-Max} RPM. However, you should do so only
@emph{ after} installing the @code{MySQL-server} RPM.
@xref{mysqld-max, , @code{mysqld-max}}.

If you get a dependency failure when trying to install the MySQL 4.0
packages (for example, ``@code{error: removing these packages would break dependencies:
libmysqlclient.so.10 is needed by ...}''), you should also install
the package @code{MySQL-shared-compat}, which includes both the
shared libraries for backward compatibility (@code{libmysqlclient.so.12}
for MySQL 4.0 and @code{libmysqlclient.so.10} for MySQL 3.23).

Many Linux distributions still ship with MySQL 3.23 and they usually link
applications dynamically to save disk space. If these shared libraries are
in a separate package (for example, @code{MySQL-shared}), it is
sufficient to simply leave this package installed and just upgrade
the MySQL server and client packages (which are statically linked
and do not depend on the shared libraries). For distributions that
include the shared libraries in the same package as the MySQL server
(for example, Red Hat Linux), you could either install our 3.23
@code{MySQL-shared} RPM, or use the @code{MySQL-shared-compat} package instead.

The following RPM packages are available:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm}

The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
connect to a MySQL server running on another machine. Please note:
Server RPM files were called @code{MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm} before
MySQL 4.0.10. That is, they did not have @code{-server} in the name.

@item @code{MySQL-Max-VERSION.i386.rpm}

The MySQL-Max server. This server has additional capabilities that the
one provided in the @code{MySQL-server} RPM does not.  You must install the
@code{MySQL-server} RPM first, because the @code{MySQL-Max} RPM depends on it.

@item @code{MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm}

The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
install this package.

@item @code{MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm}

Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and the @code{DBD::mysql} module.

@item @code{MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm}

The libraries and include files that are needed if you want to compile other
MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

@item @code{MySQL-shared-VERSION.i386.rpm}

This package contains the shared libraries (@code{libmysqlclient.so*})
that certain languages and applications need to dynamically load and
use MySQL.

@item @code{MySQL-shared-compat-VERSION.i386.rpm}

This package includes the shared libraries for both MySQL 3.23 and
MySQL 4.0. Install this package instead of @code{MySQL-shared}, if you
have applications installed that are dynamically linked against MySQL
3.23 but you want to upgrade to MySQL 4.0 without breaking the library
dependencies. This package is available since MySQL 4.0.13.

@item @code{MySQL-embedded-VERSION.i386.rpm}

The embedded MySQL server library (from MySQL 4.0).

@item @code{MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm}

This contains the source code for all of the previous packages. It can also
be used to rebuild the RPMs on other architectures (for example, Alpha or SPARC).
@end itemize

To see all files in an RPM package (for example, a @code{MySQL-server}
RPM), run:

@example
shell> rpm -qpl MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm
@end example

To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

@example
shell> rpm -i MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm
shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
@end example

To install just the client package, run:

@example
shell> rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
@end example

RPM provides a feature to verify the integrity and authenticity of packages
before installing them. If you would like to learn more about this feature
please see @ref{Verifying Package Integrity}.

The server RPM places data under the @file{/var/lib/mysql} directory. The
RPM also creates the appropriate entries in @file{/etc/init.d/} to start the
server automatically at boot time. (This means that if you have performed a
previous installation and have made changes to its startup script, you may
want to make a copy of the script so you don't lose it when you install a
newer RPM.) See @ref{Automatic start} for more information on how MySQL can be
started automatically on system startup.

If you want to install the MySQL RPM on older Linux distributions that do
not support initialization scripts in @file{/etc/init.d} (directly
or via a symlink), you should create a symbolic link that points
to the location where your initialization scripts actually are
installed. For example, if that location is @file{/etc/rc.d/init.d},
use these commands before installing the RPM to create @file{/etc/init.d}
as a symbolic link that points there:

@example
shell> cd /etc; ln -s rc.d/init.d .
@end example

However, all current major Linux distributions should already support the
new directory layout that uses @file{/etc/init.d}, because it is
required for LSB (Linux Standard Base) compliance.

If the RPM files that you install include @code{MySQL-server}, the
@code{mysqld} server should be up and running after installation.
You should now be able to start using MySQL.
@xref{Post-installation}.

If something goes wrong, you can find more information in the binary
installation chapter. @xref{Installing binary}.


@node Mac OS X installation, NetWare installation, Linux-RPM, Quick Standard Installation
@subsection Installing MySQL on Mac OS X

@cindex Mac OS X, installation
@cindex installing, Mac OS X PKG packages

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.11, you can install MySQL on Mac OS X 10.2
(``Jaguar'') using a Mac OS X binary package in @code{PKG} format instead of the
binary tarball distribution. Please note that older versions of Mac OS X
(for example, 10.1.x) are not supported by this package.

The package is located inside a disk image (@code{.dmg}) file, that you
first need to mount by double-clicking its icon in the Finder. It should
then mount the image and display its contents.

@strong{Note:} Before proceeding with the installation, be sure to
shut down all running MySQL server instances by either
using the MySQL Manager Application (on Mac OS X Server) or via
@code{mysqladmin shutdown} on the command line.

To actually install the MySQL PKG file, double click on the package icon. This
launches the Mac OS X Package Installer, which will guide you through
the installation of MySQL.

Due to a bug in the Mac OS X package installer, you may sometimes see the
error message @code{You cannot install this software on this disk. (null)}
in the destination disk selection dialogue. If this error occurs, simply
click the @code{Go Back} button once to return to the previous screen. Then
click @code{Continue} to advance to the destination disk selection again,
and you should be able to choose the destination disk correctly. We have
reported this bug to Apple and they are investigating this problem.

The Mac OS X PKG of MySQL will install itself into
@file{/usr/local/mysql-<version>} and will also install a symbolic link
@file{/usr/local/mysql}, pointing to the new location. If a directory named
@file{/usr/local/mysql} already exists, it will be renamed to
@file{/usr/local/mysql.bak} first. Additionally, it will install the
grant tables in the @code{mysql} database by executing @code{mysql_install_db}
after the installation.

The installation layout is similar to the one of the binary distribution;
all MySQL binaries are located in the directory @file{/usr/local/mysql/bin}.
The MySQL socket file is created as @file{/tmp/mysql.sock} by default.
@xref{Installation layouts}.

MySQL installation requires a Mac OS X user account named @code{mysql}
(a user account with this name should exist by default
on Mac OS X 10.2 and up).

If you are running Mac OS X Server, you already have a version of MySQL
installed.  The versions of MySQL that ship with Mac OS X Server versions are
shown in the following table:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .30
@item @strong{Mac OS X Server Version} @tab @strong{MySQL Version}
@item 10.2-10.2.2   @tab 3.23.51
@item 10.2.3-10.2.6 @tab 3.23.53
@item 10.3          @tab 4.0.14
@item 10.3.2        @tab 4.0.16
@end multitable

This manual section covers the installation of the official MySQL Mac OS X
PKG only.  Make sure to read Apple's help about installing MySQL (Run the
``Help View'' application, select ``Mac OS X Server'' help, and do a search for
``MySQL'' and read the item entitled ``Installing MySQL'').

@c This instance of safe_mysqld should be left unchanged
For pre-installed versions of MySQL on Mac OS X Server, note especially that
you should start @code{mysqld} with @code{safe_mysqld} instead of
@code{mysqld_safe} if MySQL is older than version 4.0.

If you previously used Marc Liyanage's MySQL packages for Mac OS X from
@uref{http://www.entropy.ch}, you can simply follow the update instructions
for packages using the binary installation layout as given on his pages.

If you are upgrading from Marc's 3.23.xx versions or from the Mac OS X
Server version of MySQL to the official MySQL PKG, you also need to convert
the existing MySQL privilege tables to the current format, because
some new security privileges have been added.
@xref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

If you would like to automatically start up MySQL during system startup, you
also need to install the MySQL Startup Item. Starting with MySQL 4.0.15, it
is part of the Mac OS X installation disk images as a separate installation
package. Simply double-click the @code{MySQLStartupItem.pkg} icon and follow
the instructions to install it.

Note that the Startup Item need be installed only once! There is no need to
install it each time you upgrade the MySQL package later.

The Startup Item will be installed into @file{/Library/StartupItems/MySQL}.
It adds a variable @code{MYSQLCOM=-YES-} to the system configuration file
@file{/etc/hostconfig}. If you would like to disable the automatic startup
of MySQL, simply change this variable to @code{MYSQLCOM=-NO-}.

On Mac OS X Server, the default MySQL installation uses the variable
@code{MYSQL} in @file{/etc/hostconfig}.  The MySQL AB Startup Item installer
disables this variable by setting it to @code{MYSQL=-NO-}. This avoids
boot time conflicts with the @code{MYSQLCOM} variable used by the MySQL AB
Startup Item.  However, it does not shut down an already running MySQL server.

After the installation, you can start up MySQL by running the following
commands in a terminal window. Please note that you must have
administrator privileges to perform this task.

If you have installed the Startup Item:

@example
shell> sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQL/MySQL start
(Enter your password, if necessary)
(Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)
@end example

If you don't use the Startup Item, enter the following command sequence:

@example
shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
shell> sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
(Enter your password, if necessary)
(Press Control-Z)
shell> bg
(Press Control-D or enter "exit" to exit the shell)
@end example

You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server, for example, by running
@file{/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql}.

If you are installing MySQL for the first time, @strong{please remember to set a
password for the MySQL @code{root} user!}

This is done with the following two commands:

@example
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password "newpwd"
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h `hostname` password "newpwd"
@end example

Please make sure that the @code{hostname} command in the second line
is enclosed by @strong{backtick} characters (@code{`}), so the shell can
replace it with the output of the command (which is the hostname of your
system)!

You might want to also add aliases to your shell's resource file to
access @code{mysql} and @code{mysqladmin} from the command line. The syntax
for @code{tcsh} is:

@example
alias mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
alias mysqladmin /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
@end example

For @code{bash}, use:

@example
alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
@end example

Even better,
add @code{/usr/local/mysql/bin} to
your @code{PATH} environment variable. For example, add the following
line to your @file{$HOME/.tcshrc} file if your shell is @code{tcsh}:

@example
setenv PATH $@{PATH@}:/usr/local/mysql/bin
@end example

If no @file{.tcshrc} file exists in your home directory, create it with a text
editor.

If you are upgrading an existing installation,
please note that installing a new MySQL PKG does not remove the directory
of an older installation. Unfortunately, the Mac OS X Installer does not yet
offer the functionality required to properly upgrade previously installed
packages.

To use your existing databases with the new installation, you'll need to copy
the contents of the old data directory to the new data directory. Make sure
neither the old server nor the new one is running when you do this.
After you have copied over the MySQL database files from the
previous installation and have successfully started the new server, you should
consider removing the old installation files to save disk space.
Additionally, you should also remove older versions of the Package Receipt
directories located in @file{/Library/Receipts/mysql-<version>.pkg}.

@node NetWare installation, Installing binary, Mac OS X installation, Quick Standard Installation
@subsection Installing MySQL on NetWare

@cindex Novell NetWare
@cindex NetWare

Porting MySQL to NetWare was an effort spearheaded by
Novell. Novell customers will be pleased to note that NetWare 6.5
will ship with bundled MySQL binaries, complete with an automatic
commercial use license for all servers running that version of NetWare.

MySQL for NetWare is compiled using a combination of @code{Metrowerks
CodeWarrior for NetWare} and special cross-compilation versions of the
GNU autotools.

In order to host MySQL, the NetWare server must meet these requirements:

@itemize @bullet
@item
NetWare version 6.5 or later, (Support pack 1.1 is recommended; you can
find this and other updates at
@uref{http://support.novell.com/filefinder/18197/index.html} or
NetWare 6.0 with Support Pack 3 installed (You can obtain it at
@uref{http://support.novell.com/filefinder/13659/index.html}).
@item
The system must meet Novell's minimum requirements to run the respective
version of NetWare.
@item
MySQL data, as well as the binaries themselves, must be installed on an
NSS volume; traditional volumes are not supported.
@end itemize

The latest binary packages for NetWare can be obtained at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}.

To install MySQL for NetWare, use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item
If you are upgrading from a prior installation, stop the MySQL server.
This is done from the server console, using the following command:

@example
SERVER:  mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

@item
Log on to the target server from a client machine with access to the
location where you will install MySQL.

@item
Extract the binary package Zip file onto the server. Be sure to allow
the paths in the Zip file to be used. It is safe to simply extract the
file to @file{SYS:\}.

If you are upgrading from a prior installation, you may need to copy the
data directory (for example, @file{SYS:MYSQL\DATA}) now, as well as @file{my.cnf}
if you have customized it. You can then delete the old copy of MySQL.

@item
You may wish to rename the directory to something more consistent and easy
to use. We recommend using @file{SYS:MYSQL}; examples in this manual
use this name to refer to the installation directory in general.

@item
At the server console, add a search path for the directory containing the
MySQL NLMs. For example:

@example
SERVER:  SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
@end example

@item
Initialize the data directory and the grant tables, if needed, by executing
@code{mysql_install_db} at the server console.

@item
Start the MySQL server using @code{mysqld_safe} at the server console.

@item
To finish the installation, you should also add the following commands to
@code{autoexec.ncf}. For example, if your MySQL installation is in
@file{SYS:MYSQL} and you want MySQL to start automatically, you could
add these lines:

@example
#Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
MYSQLD_SAFE
@end example

If you are running MySQL on NetWare 6.0, we strongly suggest that you use the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option on the command line:

@example
#Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
MYSQLD_SAFE --skip-external-locking
@end example

It will also be neccesary to use @code{CHECK TABLE} and @code{REPAIR
TABLE} instead of @code{myisamchk}, because @code{myisamchk} makes use
of external locking.  External locking is known to have problems on
NetWare 6.0; the problem has been eliminated in NetWare 6.5.

@code{mysqld_safe} on NetWare provides a screen presence. When you unload
(shut down) the @code{mysqld_safe} NLM, the screen does not by default go
away.  Instead, it prompts for user input:

@example
*<NLM has terminated; Press any key to close the screen>*
@end example

If you want NetWare to close the screen automatically instead, use the
@code{--autoclose} option to @code{mysqld_safe}. For example:

@example
#Starts the MySQL 4.0.x database server
SEARCH ADD SYS:MYSQL\BIN
MYSQLD_SAFE --autoclose
@end example

The behavior of @code{mysqld_safe} on NetWare is described further in
@ref{mysqld_safe,  , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

If there was an existing installation of MySQL on the server, be sure
to check for existing MySQL startup commands in @code{autoexec.ncf},
and edit or delete them as necessary.

This section covers the installation of MySQL binary distributions that are
provided for various platforms in the form of compressed @code{tar} files
(files with a @code{.tar.gz} extension).  See @ref{MySQL binaries} for a
detailed list.

In addition to these generic packages, we also offer binaries in
platform-specific package formats for selected platforms.
See @ref{Quick Standard Installation} for more information on how to install
these.

You need the following tools to install a MySQL @code{tar} file binary
distribution:

@itemize @bullet
@item
GNU @code{gunzip} to uncompress the distribution.

@item
A reasonable @code{tar} to unpack the distribution. GNU @code{tar} is known
to work. Some operating systems come with a pre-installed version of
@code{tar} that is known to have problems.  For example, Mac OS X @code{tar}
and Sun @code{tar} are known to have problems with long filenames.  On Mac
OS X, you can use the pre-installed @code{gnutar} program.  On other systems
with a deficient @code{tar}, you should install GNU @code{tar} first.
@end itemize

@c texi2html fails to split chapters if I use strong for all of this.
If you run into problems, @strong{please always use @code{mysqlbug}} when
posting questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem

solve your problem.  By not using @code{mysqlbug}, you lessen the likelihood
of getting a solution to your problem.  You will find @code{mysqlbug} in the
@file{bin} directory after you unpack the distribution.  @xref{Bug reports}.

@cindex commands, for binary distribution
The basic commands you must execute to install and use a MySQL
binary distribution are:

@example
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
shell> cd /usr/local
shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
shell> cd mysql
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> chown -R root  .
shell> chown -R mysql data
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute @code{bin/safe_mysqld}
for @code{bin/mysqld_safe} in the final command.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a binary distribution, follow these steps, then proceed
to @ref{Post-installation}, for post-installation setup and testing:

@enumerate

@item
Add a user and group for @code{mysqld} to run as:

@example
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
@end example

These commands add the @code{mysql} group and the @code{mysql} user.  The
syntax for @code{useradd} and @code{groupadd} may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called @code{adduser} and @code{addgroup}.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of @code{mysql}.

@item
Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution, and move
into it. In the following example, we unpack the distribution under
@file{/usr/local} (The following instructions, therefore, assume that you have
permission to create files and directories in @file{/usr/local}.
If that directory is protected, you will need to perform the installation as
@code{root}.)

@item
Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in
@ref{Getting MySQL, , Getting MySQL}.

MySQL @code{tar} file binary distributions
have names like @file{mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz}, where
@code{VERSION} is a number (for example, @code{4.0.17}), and @code{OS}
indicates the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
(for example, @code{pc-linux-gnu-i586}).
For a given release, binary distributions for all platforms
are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

@item
Change into the intended installation directory:

@example
shell> cd /usr/local
@end example

@item
Unpack the distribution, which will create the installation directory.
Then create a symbolic link to that directory:

@example
shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
@end example

The @code{tar} command creates a directory named @file{mysql-VERSION-OS}.  The
@code{ln} command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This lets you refer
more easily to the installation directory as @file{/usr/local/mysql}.

With GNU @code{tar}, no separate invocation of @code{gunzip} is necessary.
You can replace the first line with the following
alternative command to uncompress and extract the distribution:

@example
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
@end example

@item
Change into the installation directory:

@example
shell> cd mysql
@end example

You will find several files and subdirectories in the @code{mysql} directory.
The most important for installation purposes are the @file{bin} and
@file{scripts} subdirectories.

@table @file
@item bin
@tindex PATH environment variable
@tindex environment variable, PATH
This directory contains client programs and the server.
You should add the full pathname of this directory to your
@code{PATH} environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
programs properly. @xref{Environment variables}.

@item scripts
This directory contains the @code{mysql_install_db} script used to initialize
the @code{mysql} database containing the grant tables that store the server
access permissions.
@end table

@item
If you haven't installed MySQL before, you must create the MySQL grant tables:

@example
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
@end example

If you run the command as @code{root}, you should use the @code{--user}
option as shown. If you run the command as @code{mysql}, you can omit it.

Note that for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
@code{mysql_install_db} left the server running after creating the grant
tables.  This is no longer true; you will need to restart the server after
performing the remaining steps in this procedure.

@item
Change ownership of program binaries to @code{root} and ownership of the data
directory to the user that you will run @code{mysqld} as.  Assuming that you
are located in the installation directory (@file{/usr/local/mysql}), the
commands look like this:

@example
shell> chown -R root  .
shell> chown -R mysql data
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
@end example

The first command changes the @code{owner} attribute of the files to the
@code{root} user. The second changes the @code{owner} attribute of the
data directory to the @code{mysql} user. The third changes the
@code{group} attribute to the @code{mysql} group.

@item
If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy @code{support-files/mysql.server} to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
@code{support-files/mysql.server} script itself and in
@ref{Automatic start}.

@item
@cindex adding, new users
@cindex new users, adding
@cindex users, adding
You can set up new accounts using the @code{bin/mysql_setpermission} script if
you install the @code{DBI} and @code{DBD::mysql} Perl modules.
For instructions, see @ref{Perl support}.

@item
If you would like to use @code{mysqlaccess} and have the MySQL
distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the location where
@code{mysqlaccess} expects to find the @code{mysql} client.  Edit the
@file{bin/mysqlaccess} script at approximately line 18.  Search for a line
that looks like this:

@example
$MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable
@end example

Change the path to reflect the location where @code{mysql} actually is
stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a @code{Broken
pipe} error when you run @code{mysqlaccess}.

@end enumerate

After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should
test your distribution.

You can start the MySQL server with the following command:

@example
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute @code{bin/safe_mysqld}
for @code{bin/mysqld_safe} in the command.

Now proceed to @ref{Post-installation}.

More information about @code{mysqld_safe} is given in
@ref{mysqld_safe, , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

@itemize @bullet
@item
GNU @code{gunzip} to uncompress the distribution.

@item
A reasonable @code{tar} to unpack the distribution. GNU @code{tar} is
known to work. Some @code{tar} implementations that come pre-installed
with the operating system (for example, Sun @code{tar}) is known to have
problems with long file names). In that case, you should install
GNU @code{tar} first.

@item
A working ANSI C++ compiler.  @code{gcc} 2.95.2 or later, @code{egcs} 1.0.2 or later or @code{egcs 2.91.66}, SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
compilers that are known to work.  @code{libg++} is not needed when
using @code{gcc}.  @code{gcc} 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible
to compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as
@file{sql/sql_base.cc}.  If you only have @code{gcc} 2.7.x, you must
upgrade your @code{gcc} to be able to compile MySQL. @code{gcc}
2.8.1 is also known to have problems on some platforms, so it should be
avoided if a new compiler exists for the platform.

@code{gcc} 2.95.2 or later is recommended when compiling MySQL
Version 3.23.x.

@item
A good @code{make} program.  GNU @code{make} is always recommended and is
sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
@code{make} 3.75 or newer.
@end itemize

If you are using a recent version of @code{gcc}, recent enough to understand the
@code{-fno-exceptions} option, it is @strong{very important} that you use
it. Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use @code{-felide-constructors} and @code{-fno-rtti} along
with @code{-fno-exceptions}. When in doubt, do the following:

@example

CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
       -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
       --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
       --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

@end example

On most systems this will give you a fast and stable binary.

@c texi2html fails to split chapters if I use strong for all of this.
If you run into problems, @strong{please always use @code{mysqlbug}} when
posting questions to a MySQL mailing list.  Even if the problem
isn't a bug, @code{mysqlbug} gathers system information that will help others
solve your problem.  By not using @code{mysqlbug}, you lessen the likelihood
of getting a solution to your problem.  You will find @code{mysqlbug} in the
@file{scripts} directory after you unpack the distribution.

@subsection Quick Source Installation Overview

The basic commands you must execute to install a MySQL source
distribution are:

@example
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
shell> gunzip < mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
shell> cd mysql-VERSION
shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell> make
shell> make install
shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
shell> bin/mysql_install_db
shell> chown -R root  .
shell> chown -R mysql var
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute @code{bin/safe_mysqld}
for @code{bin/mysqld_safe} in the final command.

If you start from a source RPM, do the following:

@example
shell> rpm --rebuild --clean MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm
@end example

This will make a binary RPM that you can install.

A more detailed description follows.

To install a source distribution, follow these steps, then proceed
to @ref{Post-installation}, for post-installation initialization and testing:

@enumerate

@item
Add a user and group for @code{mysqld} to run as:

@example
shell> groupadd mysql
shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
@end example

These commands add the @code{mysql} group and the @code{mysql} user.  The
syntax for @code{useradd} and @code{groupadd} may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called @code{adduser} and @code{addgroup}.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of @code{mysql}.

@item
Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution, and move
into it.

@item
Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in
@ref{Getting MySQL, , Getting MySQL}.
MySQL source distributions are provided as compressed @code{tar}
archives and have names like @file{mysql-VERSION.tar.gz}, where
@code{VERSION} is a number like @code{@value{mysqlversion}}.

@item
Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
@example
shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysql-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
@end example

This command creates a directory named @file{mysql-VERSION}.

With GNU @code{tar}, no separate invocation of @code{gunzip} is necessary.
You can use the following alternative command to uncompress and extract
the distribution:

@example
shell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz
@end example

@item
Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

@example
shell> cd mysql-VERSION
@end example

Note that currently you must configure and build MySQL from
this top-level directory.  You cannot build it in a different
directory.

@item
Configure the release and compile everything:

@example
shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell> make
@end example

When you run @code{configure}, you might want to specify some options.
Run @code{./configure --help} for a list of options.
@ref{configure options, , @code{configure} options}, discusses some of the
more useful options.

If @code{configure} fails and you are going to send mail to a MySQL mailing
list to ask for assistance, please include any
lines from @file{config.log} that you think can help solve the problem.  Also
include the last couple of lines of output from @code{configure}.
Post the bug report using the @code{mysqlbug}
script.  @xref{Bug reports}.

If the compile fails, see @ref{Compilation problems}, for help with
a number of common problems.

@item
Install the distribution:

@example
shell> make install
@end example

If you want to set up an option file, use one of those present in the
@file{support-files} directory as template. For example:

@example
shell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
@end example

You might need to run these commands as @code{root}.

If you want to configure support for @code{InnoDB} tables, you should edit the
@code{/etc/my.cnf} file, remove the @code{#} character before the
option lines that start with @code{innodb_...}, and modify the option values
to be what you want.
See @ref{Option files}
and @ref{InnoDB configuration,  , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.

@item
Change location into the installation directory:

@example
shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
@end example

@item
If you haven't installed MySQL before, you must create the MySQL grant tables:

@example
shell> bin/mysql_install_db
@end example

Note that for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
@code{mysql_install_db} left the server running after creating the grant
tables.  This is no longer true; you will need to restart the server after
performing the remaining steps in this procedure.

@item
Change ownership of binaries to @code{root} and ownership of the data
directory to the user that you will run @code{mysqld} as.  Assuming that you
are located in the installation directory (@file{/usr/local/mysql}), the
commands look like this:

@example
shell> chown -R root  .
shell> chown -R mysql var
shell> chgrp -R mysql .
@end example

The first command changes the @code{owner} attribute of the files to the
@code{root} user. The second changes the @code{owner} attribute of the
data directory to the @code{mysql} user. The third changes the
@code{group} attribute to the @code{mysql} group.

@item
If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy @code{support-files/mysql.server} to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
@code{support-files/mysql.server} script itself and in
@ref{Automatic start}.

@item
@cindex adding, new users
@cindex new users, adding
@cindex users, adding
You can set up new accounts using the @code{bin/mysql_setpermission} script if
you install the @code{DBI} and @code{DBD::mysql} Perl modules.
For instructions, see @ref{Perl support}.

@end enumerate

After everything has been installed, you should initialize and test your
distribution using this command:

@example
shell> /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute @code{bin/safe_mysqld}
for @code{bin/mysqld_safe} in the command.

If that command fails immediately and prints @code{mysqld ended}, you can
find some information in the file @file{mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err}.
The likely reason is that you already have another @code{mysqld} server
running.  @xref{Multiple servers}.

Now proceed to @ref{Post-installation}.


@node configure options, Installing source tree, Quick install, Installing source
@subsection Typical @code{configure} Options

@findex without-server option
@cindex @code{configure} script
@cindex options, configure
@cindex configuration options
@cindex log files
@cindex files, log

The @code{configure} script gives you a great deal of control over how
you configure a MySQL source distribution.  Typically you do this
using options on the @code{configure} command line.  You can also affect
@code{configure} using certain environment variables.  @xref{Environment
variables}.  For a list of options supported by @code{configure}, run
this command:

@example
shell> ./configure --help
@end example

Some of the more commonly used @code{configure} options are described here:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
not the server, use the @code{--without-server} option:

@example
shell> ./configure --without-server
@end example

@c FIX incorrect..

If you don't have a C++ compiler, @code{mysql} will not compile (it is the
one client program that requires C++).  In this case,
you can remove the code in @code{configure} that tests for the C++ compiler
and then run @code{./configure} with the @code{--without-server} option. The
compile step will still try to build @code{mysql}, but you can ignore any
warnings about @file{mysql.cc}.  (If @code{make} stops, try @code{make -k}
to tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors occur.)

@item
If you want to get an embedded MySQL library (@code{libmysqld.a}) you should
use the @code{--with-embedded-server} option.

@item
If you don't want your log files and database directories located under
@file{/usr/local/var}, use a @code{configure} command, something like one
of these:

@example
shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
           --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data
@end example

The first command changes the installation prefix so that everything is
installed under @file{/usr/local/mysql} rather than the default of
@file{/usr/local}.  The second command preserves the default installation
prefix, but overrides the default location for database directories
(normally @file{/usr/local/var}) and changes it to
@code{/usr/local/mysql/data}.  After you have compiled MySQL, you can
change these options with option files. @xref{Option files}.

@cindex changing socket location
@cindex socket location, changing
@cindex mysql.sock, changing location of
@item
If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located somewhere
other than the default location (normally in the directory @file{/tmp} or
@file{/var/run}) use a @code{configure} command like this:

@example
shell> ./configure \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock
@end example

Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname.
You can also later change the location of @file{mysql.sock} by using a MySQL
option file. @xref{Problems with mysql.sock,  , Problems with @file{mysql.sock}}.

@cindex compiling, statically
@cindex statically, compiling
@item
If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to make a
binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around problems with some
Red Hat Linux distributions), run @code{configure} like this:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-client-ldflags=-all-static \
           --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
@end example



@tindex @code{CC} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{CC}
@tindex @code{CXX} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{CXX}
@cindex @code{gcc}
@cindex C++ compiler, @code{gcc}
@cindex compiler, C++ @code{gcc}
@item
If you are using @code{gcc} and don't have @code{libg++} or @code{libstdc++}
installed, you can tell @code{configure} to use @code{gcc} as your C++
compiler:

@example
shell> CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure
@end example

When you use @code{gcc} as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to link in
@code{libg++} or @code{libstdc++}.  This may be a good idea to do even if you
have these libraries installed, as some versions of them have
caused strange problems for MySQL users in the past.

The following list indicates some compilers and environment variable settings
that are commonly used with each one.

@tindex CC environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CC
@tindex CXX environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CXX
@tindex CFLAGS environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CFLAGS
@tindex CXXFLAGS environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CXXFLAGS

@table @asis
@item
@item @code{gcc} 2.7.2:
@code{CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors"}
@item @code{egcs} 1.0.3a:
@code{CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors \
-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"}
@item @code{gcc} 2.95.2:
@code{CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"}
@item @code{pgcc} 2.90.29 or newer:
@code{CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro -mstack-align-double \
-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti"}
@end table

In most cases you can get a reasonably optimal MySQL binary by using the
options from the preceding list and adding the following options to the
@code{configure} line:

@example
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
@end example

The full @code{configure} line would, in other words, be something like the
following for all recent @code{gcc} versions:

@example
CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
@end example

The binaries we provide on the MySQL Web site at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/} are all compiled with full optimization and
should be perfect for most users.  @xref{MySQL binaries}.  There are some
configuration setings you can tweak to make an even faster binary, but this
is only for advanced users.  @xref{Compile and link options}.

If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or linker not
being able to create the shared library @file{libmysqlclient.so.#} (@samp{#}
is a version number), you can work around this problem by giving the
@code{--disable-shared} option to @code{configure}.  In this case,
@code{configure} will not build a shared @file{libmysqlclient.so.#} library.

@cindex default values, suppression
@cindex suppression, default values
@item
You can configure MySQL not to use @code{DEFAULT} column values for
non-@code{NULL} columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be
@code{NULL}). @xref{constraint NOT NULL}.

@tindex CXXFLAGS environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CXXFLAGS
@tindex DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compiler flag
@tindex compiler flag, DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS
@example
shell> CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS ./configure
@end example

The effect of this flag is to cause any @code{INSERT} statement to fail unless
it provides explicit values for all columns that require a non-@code{NULL}
value.

@cindex character sets
@findex configure option, --with-charset
@findex configure option, --with-extra-charsets
@findex configure option, --with-collation
@item
By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
change the default set, use the @code{--with-charset} option:
@example
shell> ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
@end example
@code{CHARSET} may be one of @code{big5}, @code{cp1251}, @code{cp1257},
@code{czech}, @code{danish}, @code{dec8}, @code{dos}, @code{euc_kr},
@code{gb2312}, @code{gbk}, @code{german1}, @code{hebrew}, @code{hp8},
@code{hungarian}, @code{koi8_ru}, @code{koi8_ukr}, @code{latin1},
@code{latin2}, @code{sjis}, @code{swe7}, @code{tis620}, @code{ujis},
@code{usa7}, or @code{win1251ukr}.
@xref{Character sets}.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, the default collation may also be specified. MySQL uses
the @code{latin1_swedish_ci} collation. To change this, use the
@code{--with-collation} option:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-collation=COLLATION
@end example

To change both the character set and the collation, use both the
@code{--with-charset} and @code{--with-collation} options.
The collation must be a legal collation for the character set.
(Use the @code{SHOW COLLATION} statement to determine which collations are
available for each character set.)

If you want to convert characters between the server and the client,
you should take a look at the @code{SET CHARACTER SET} command.
@xref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET}}.

@cindex @code{myisamchk}
@strong{Warning:} If you change character sets after having created any
tables, you will have to run @code{myisamchk -r -q --set-character-set=charset}
on every table. Your
indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if you
install MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure
MySQL to use a different character set and reinstall it.)

With the @code{configure} option @code{--with-extra-charsets=LIST}, you can
define which additional character sets should be compiled into the server.
@code{LIST} is either a list of character sets separated by spaces,
@code{complex} to include all characters that can't be dynamically loaded,
or @code{all} to include all character sets into the binaries.

@item
To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the @code{--with-debug}
option:
@example
shell> ./configure --with-debug
@end example
This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find some errors
and that provides output about what is happening.
@xref{Debugging server}.

@item
If your client programs are using threads, you also must compile a
thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
@code{--enable-thread-safe-client} configure options. This will create a
@code{libmysqlclient_r} library with which you should link your threaded
applications.  @xref{Threaded clients}.

@item
Options that pertain to particular systems can be found in the
system-specific section of this manual.
@xref{Operating System Specific Notes}.

@node Installing source tree, Compilation problems, configure options, Installing source
@subsection Installing from the Development Source Tree

@cindex development source tree
@cindex BitKeeper tree
@cindex CVS tree

@strong{Caution}: You should read this section only if you are interested
in helping us test our new code. If you just want to get MySQL up
and running on your system, you should use a standard release distribution
(either a binary or source distribution will do).

To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these instructions:

@enumerate
@item
Download @code{BitKeeper} from
@uref{http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi}.  You will need
@code{Bitkeeper} 3.0 or newer to access our repository.

@item
Follow the instructions to install it.

@item
After @code{BitKeeper} is installed, first go to the directory you
want to work from, and then use one of the following commands to clone
the MySQL version branch of your choice:

To clone the old 3.23 branch, use this command:

@example
shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-3.23 mysql-3.23
@end example

To clone the 4.0 stable (production) branch, use this command:

@example
shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.0 mysql-4.0
@end example

To clone the 4.1 alpha branch, use this command:

@example
shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
@end example

To clone the 5.0 development branch, use this command:

@example
shell> bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-5.0 mysql-5.0
@end example

In the preceding examples the source tree will be set up in the
@file{mysql-3.23/}, @file{mysql-4.0/}, @file{mysql-4.1/}, or @file{mysql-5.0/}
subdirectory of your current directory.

If you are behind a firewall and can only initiate HTTP connections,
you can also use @code{BitKeeper} via HTTP.

If you are required to use a proxy server, set the environment
variable @code{http_proxy} to point to your proxy:

@example
shell> export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/"
@end example

Now, simply replace the @code{bk://} with @code{http://} when doing
a clone. Example:

@example
shell> bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
@end example

The initial download of the source tree may take a while, depending on the
speed of your connection---please be patient.

@item
You will need GNU @code{make}, @code{autoconf} 2.53 (or newer),
@code{automake} 1.5, @code{libtool} 1.5, and @code{m4} to run the next
set of commands. Even though many operating systems already come with their
own implementation of @code{make}, chances are high that the compilation
will fail with strange error messages. Therefore, it is highly recommended
that you use GNU @code{make} (sometimes named @code{gmake}) instead.

Fortunately, a large number of operating systems already ship with the GNU
toolchain preinstalled or supply installable packages of these. In any case,
they can also be downloaded from the following locations:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/}
@item
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/}
@end itemize

If you are trying to configure MySQL 4.1 or later, you will also need GNU
@code{bison} 1.75 or later.  Older versions of @code{bison} may report this
error:

@example
sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767) exceeded
@end example

Note: The maximum table size is not actually exceeded,
the error is caused by bugs in older versions of @code{bison}.

Versions of MySQL before version 4.1 may also compile with other
@code{yacc} implementations (for example, BSD @code{yacc} 91.7.30). For later
versions, GNU @code{bison} is required.

The following example shows the typical commands required to configure a
source tree. The first @code{cd} command changes location into the top-level
directory of the tree; replace @file{mysql-4.0} with the appropriate directory
name.

@example
shell> cd mysql-4.0
shell> bk -r edit
shell> aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake
shell> (cd innobase; aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake)
shell> (cd bdb/dist; sh s_all)
shell> ./configure  # Add your favorite options here
make
@end example

The command lines that change directory into the @file{innobase} and
@file{bdb/dist} directories are used to configure the @code{InnoDB} and
Berkeley DB (@code{BDB}) storage engines.  You can omit these command lines if
you to not require @code{InnoDB} or @code{BDB} support.

If you get some strange error during this stage, verify that you really
have @code{libtool} installed.

A collection of our standard configuration scripts is located in the
@file{BUILD/} subdirectory.  You may find it more convenient to use the
@file{BUILD/compile-pentium-debug} script than the preceding set of
shell commands.. To compile on a different architecture,
modify the script by removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

@item
When the build is done, run @code{make install}.  Be careful with this
on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live release
installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL, we
recommend that you run @code{./configure} with different values for the
@code{--prefix}, @code{--with-tcp-port}, and @code{--unix-socket-path} options
than those used for your production server.

@item
Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new features
crash.  Start by running @code{make test}.  @xref{MySQL test suite}.

@item
If you have gotten to the @code{make} stage and the distribution does
not compile, please report it in our bugs database at
@uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}.  If you
have installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and they
crash trying to process our configuration files, please report that also.
However, if you execute @code{aclocal} and get a @code{command not found}
error or a similar problem, do not report it.  Instead, make sure that all
the necessary tools are installed and that your @code{PATH} variable is
set correctly so that your shell can find them.

@item
After the initial @code{bk clone} operation to obtain the source tree, you
should run @code{bk pull} periodically to get updates.

@item
You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs by using
@code{bk revtool}.  If you see some funny diffs or code that you have a
question about, do not hesitate to send email to the MySQL internals mailing
list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.
Also, if you think you have a better idea
on how to do something, send an email message to the same address with a patch.
@code{bk diffs} will produce a patch for you after you have made changes
to the source. If you do not have the time to code your idea, just send
a description.

@item
@code{BitKeeper} has a nice help utility that you can access via
@code{bk helptool}.

@item
Please note that any commits (@code{bk ci} or @code{bk citool}) will
trigger the posting of a message with the changeset to our internals
mailing list, as well as the usual openlogging.org submission with
just the changeset comments.
Generally, you wouldn't need to use commit (since the public tree will
not allow @code{bk push}), but rather use the @code{bk diffs} method
described previously.

@end enumerate

You can also browse changesets, comments, and source code online. For example,

@subsection Dealing With Problems Compiling MySQL

@cindex compiling, problems
@cindex problems, compiling
@cindex reconfiguring
@cindex @code{config.cache} file
@cindex files, @code{config.cache}

All MySQL programs compile cleanly for us with no warnings on
Solaris or Linux using @code{gcc}.  On other systems, warnings may occur due to
differences in system include files.  See @ref{MIT-pthreads} for warnings
that may occur when using MIT-pthreads.  For other problems, check
the following list.

The solution to many problems involves reconfiguring.  If you do need to
reconfigure, take note of the following:

@cindex running @code{configure} after prior invocation
@cindex @code{configure}, running after prior invocation
@cindex reconfiguring
@cindex config.cache
@itemize @bullet
@item
If @code{configure} is run after it already has been run, it may use
information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This
information is stored in @file{config.cache}.  When @code{configure} starts
up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on the
assumption that the information is still correct.  That assumption is invalid
when you reconfigure.

@item
Each time you run @code{configure}, you must run @code{make} again
to recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
builds first because they were compiled using different configuration options.
@end itemize

To prevent old configuration information or object files from being used,
run these commands before re-running @code{configure}:

@example
shell> rm config.cache
shell> make clean
@end example

Alternatively, you can run @code{make distclean}.

The following list describes some of the problems when compiling MySQL
that have been found to occur most often:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex @code{cc1plus} problems
@cindex @code{fatal signal 11}
@cindex @code{sql_yacc.cc} problems
@cindex internal compiler errors
@cindex virtual memory, problems while compiling
@cindex configure option, --with-low-memory
If you get errors when compiling @file{sql_yacc.cc}, such as the ones shown
here, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:

@example
Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
@end example
Or:
@example
Out of virtual memory
@end example
Or:
@example
Virtual memory exhausted
@end example

The problem is that @code{gcc} requires huge amounts of memory to compile
@file{sql_yacc.cc} with inline functions.  Try running @code{configure} with
the @code{--with-low-memory} option:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-low-memory
@end example

This option causes @code{-fno-inline} to be added to the compile line if you
are using @code{gcc} and @code{-O0} if you are using something else.  You
should try the @code{--with-low-memory} option even if you have so much
memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have run out.  This
problem has been observed to occur even on systems with generous hardware
configurations, and the @code{--with-low-memory} option usually fixes it.

@item
By default, @code{configure} picks @code{c++} as the compiler name and
GNU @code{c++} links with @code{-lg++}.  If you are using @code{gcc},
that behavior can cause problems during configuration such as this:

@cindex C++ compiler cannot create executables
@example
configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C++ compiler cannot create executables.
@end example

@tindex CXX environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, CXX
You might also observe problems during compilation related to
@code{g++}, @code{libg++}, or @code{libstdc++}.

One cause of these problems is that you may not have @code{g++}, or you may
have @code{g++} but not @code{libg++}, or @code{libstdc++}.  Take a look at
the @file{config.log} file.  It should contain the exact reason why your C++
compiler didn't work.  To work around these problems, you can use @code{gcc}
as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment variable @code{CXX} to
@code{"gcc -O3"}.  For example:

@tindex CXX environment variable
@tindex Environment variables, CXX
@example
shell> CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure
@end example

This works because @code{gcc} compiles C++ sources as well as @code{g++}
does, but does not link in @code{libg++} or @code{libstdc++} by default.

Another way to fix these problems is to install @code{g++},
@code{libg++}, and @code{libstdc++}.  We would however like to recommend
you to not use @code{libg++} or @code{libstdc++} with MySQL as this will
only increase the binary size of mysqld without giving you any benefits.
Some versions of these libraries have also caused strange problems for
MySQL users in the past.

@cindex RAID, compile errors
@cindex @code{--with-raid} link errors
Using @code{gcc} as the C++ compiler is also required, if you want to
compile MySQL with RAID functionality (see @ref{CREATE TABLE} for more info
on RAID table type) and you are using GNU @code{gcc} version 3 and above. If
you get errors like those following during the linking stage when you
configure MySQL to compile with the option @code{--with-raid}, try to use
@code{gcc} as your C++ compiler by defining the @code{CXX} environment
variable:

@example
gcc -O3 -DDBUG_OFF -rdynamic -o isamchk isamchk.o sort.o  libnisam.a
../mysys/libmysys.a ../dbug/libdbug.a ../strings/libmystrings.a
 -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread
../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x79): In function
`my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0xdd): In function
`my_raid_create':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x129): In function
`my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator new(unsigned)'
../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x189): In function
`my_raid_open':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
../mysys/libmysys.a(raid.o)(.text+0x64b): In function
`my_raid_close':: undefined reference to `operator delete(void*)'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
@end example

@item
If your compile fails with errors, such as any of the following,
you must upgrade your version of @code{make} to GNU @code{make}:

@example
making all in mit-pthreads
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 18:
Badly formed macro assignment
@end example
Or:
@example
make: file `Makefile' line 18: Must be a separator (:
@end example
Or:
@example
pthread.h: No such file or directory
@end example

@tindex CXX environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CXX
@tindex CFLAGS environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CFLAGS
@tindex CXXFLAGS environment variable
@tindex environment variable, CXXFLAGS
@item
If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers, do so by
adding the flags to the @code{CFLAGS} and @code{CXXFLAGS} environment
variables.  You can also specify the compiler names this way using @code{CC}
and @code{CXX}.  For example:

@example
shell> CC=gcc
shell> CFLAGS=-O3
shell> CXX=gcc
shell> CXXFLAGS=-O3
shell> export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
@end example

See @ref{MySQL binaries}, for a list of flag definitions that have been found
to be useful on various systems.

@item
If you get an error message like this,
you need to upgrade your @code{gcc} compiler:

@example
client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'
@end example

@code{gcc} 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using @code{gcc} 2.95.2 or
@code{egcs} 1.0.3a instead.

@item
If you get errors such as those shown here when compiling @code{mysqld},
@code{configure} didn't correctly detect the type of the last argument to
@code{accept()}, @code{getsockname()}, or @code{getpeername()}:

@example
cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
     type of the pointer value ''length'' is ''unsigned long'',
     which is not compatible with ''int''.
new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&cAddr, &length);
@end example

To fix this, edit the @file{config.h} file (which is generated by
@code{configure}).  Look for these lines:

@example
/* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
#define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX
@end example

Change @code{XXX} to @code{size_t} or @code{int}, depending on your
operating system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
@code{configure} because @code{configure} regenerates @file{config.h}.)

@item
The @file{sql_yacc.cc} file is generated from @file{sql_yacc.yy}.  Normally
the build process doesn't need to create @file{sql_yacc.cc}, because
MySQL comes with an already generated copy.  However, if you do need
to re-create it, you might encounter this error:

@example
"sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
@end example

This is a sign that your version of @code{yacc} is deficient.
You probably need to install @code{bison} (the GNU version of @code{yacc})
and use that instead.

@item
On Debian Linux 3.0, you need to install @code{gawk} instead of the default
@code{mawk}, if you want to compile MySQL 4.1 or higher with Berkeley DB
support.

@item
If you need to debug @code{mysqld} or a MySQL client, run
@code{configure} with the @code{--with-debug} option, then recompile and
link your clients with the new client library.  @xref{Debugging client}.

@item
If you get a compilation error on Linux (for example, SuSE Linux 8.1 or Red Hat
Linux 7.3) similar to the following one:

@example
libmysql.c:1329: warning: passing arg 5 of `gethostbyname_r' from
incompatible pointer type
libmysql.c:1329: too few arguments to function `gethostbyname_r'
libmysql.c:1329: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer
without a cast
make[2]: *** [libmysql.lo] Error 1
@end example

By default, the @code{configure} script attempts to determine the correct
number of arguments by using @code{g++} the GNU C++ compiler. This test
yields wrong results, if @code{g++} is not installed. There are two ways
to work around this problem:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Make sure that the GNU C++ @code{g++} is installed. On some Linux
distributions, the required package is called @code{gpp}, on others it
is named @code{gcc-c++}.
@item
Use @code{gcc} as your C++ compiler by setting the @code{CXX} environment
variable to @code{gcc}:
@example
export CXX="gcc"
@end example
@end itemize

Please note that you need to run @code{configure} again afterward.

@node MIT-pthreads, Windows source build, Compilation problems, Installing source
@subsection MIT-pthreads Notes

@cindex MIT-pthreads
@cindex thread support, non-native

This section describes some of the issues involved in using MIT-pthreads.

Note that on Linux you should @strong{not} use MIT-pthreads but use the
installed LinuxThreads implementation instead.
@xref{Linux}.

If your system does not provide native thread support, you will need to
build MySQL using the MIT-pthreads package.  This includes
older FreeBSD systems, SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.4 and earlier, and some others.
@xref{Which OS}.

Note that, beginning with MySQL 4.0.2, MIT-pthreads are no longer part of
the source distribution. If you require this package, you need to download
it separately from
@url{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/pthreads-1_60_beta6-mysql.tar.gz}

After downloading, extract this source archive into the top level of the
MySQL source directory. It will create a new subdirectory
@code{mit-pthreads}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
On most systems, you can force MIT-pthreads to be used by running
@code{configure} with the @code{--with-mit-threads} option:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-mit-threads
@end example

Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
MIT-pthreads because we want to minimize our changes to this code.

@item
The checks that determine whether to use MIT-pthreads occur only
during the part of the configuration process that deals with the server
code.  If you have configured the distribution using @code{--without-server}
to build only the client code, clients will not know whether
MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix socket connections by default.
Because Unix socket files do not work under MIT-pthreads on some platforms, this
means you will need to use @code{-h} or @code{--host} when you run client
programs.

@item
When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the server to use
system locking with the @code{--external-locking} option.  This is only
needed if you want to be able to run two MySQL servers against the same
data files (not recommended).

@item
Sometimes the pthread @code{bind()} command fails to bind to a socket without
any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is that all connections
to the server fail.  For example:

@example
shell> mysqladmin version
mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'
@end example

The solution to this is to kill the @code{mysqld} server and restart it.
This has only happened to us when we have forced down the server and done
a restart immediately.

@item
With MIT-pthreads, the @code{sleep()} system call isn't interruptible with
@code{SIGINT} (break).  This is only noticeable when you run
@code{mysqladmin --sleep}.  You must wait for the @code{sleep()} call to
terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

@item
When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at least on
Solaris); they can be ignored:

@example
ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
ld: warning: symbol `__iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;
file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
@end example

@item
Some other warnings also can be ignored:

@example
implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'
@end example

@item
We haven't gotten @code{readline} to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This isn't
needed, but may be interesting for someone.)

@subsection Installing MySQL from Source on Windows

These instructions describe how to build MySQL binaries from source
for versions 4.1 and above on Windows. Instructions are provided
for building binaries from a standard source distribution or from
the BitKeeper tree that contains the latest development source.

@strong{Note:}
The instructions in this document are strictly for users who want
to test MySQL on Windows from the latest source distribution or
from the BitKeeper tree.  For production use, MySQL AB does not
advise using a MySQL server built by yourself from source.  Normally,
it is best to use precompiled binary distributions of MySQL that
are built specifically for optimal performance on Windows by MySQL
AB.  Instructions for installing a binary distributions are available
at @ref{Windows installation}.

To build MySQL on Windows from source, you need the following
compiler and resources available on your Windows system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
VC++ 6.0 compiler (updated with 4 or 5 SP and pre-processor package).
The pre-processor package is necessary for the macro assembler.
More details at:
@uref{http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/faq.aspx}.

@item
Approximately 45MB disk space.

@item
64MB RAM.

@end itemize

You'll also need a MySQL source distribution for Windows.  There
are two ways you can get a source distribution for MySQL version
4.1 and above:

@enumerate
@item
Obtain a source distribution packaged by MySQL AB for the particular
version of MySQL in which you are interested.  Prepackaged source
distributions are available for released versions of MySQL and can
be obtained from @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}.

@item
You can package a source distribution yourself from the latest
BitKeeper developer source tree. If you plan to do this, you must
create the package on a Unix system and then transfer it to your
Windows system.  (The reason for this is that some of the configuration
and build steps require tools that work only on Unix.)  The BitKeeper
approach thus requires:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A system running Unix, or a Unix-like system such as Linux.

@item
BitKeeper 3.0 installed on that system. You can obtain
BitKeeper from @uref{http://www.bitkeeper.com/}.

@end itemize

@end enumerate

If you are using a Windows source distribution, you can go directly to
@ref{Windows VC++ Build}. To build from the BitKeeper tree, proceed to
@ref{Windows BitKeeper Build}.

If you find something not working as expected, or you have
suggestions about ways to improve the current build process
on Windows, please send a message to the @code{win32} mailing list.

@subsubsection Building MySQL Using VC++

@strong{Note:}
MySQL 4.1 and above VC++ workspace files are compatible with
Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and above (7.0/.NET) editions and tested
by MySQL AB staff before each release.

Follow this procedure to build MySQL:

@enumerate
@item
Create a work directory (for example, @file{workdir}).
@item
Unpack the source distribution in the aforementioned directory using
@code{WinZip} or other Windows tools that can read @file{.zip} files.
@item
Start the VC++ 6.0 compiler.
@item
In the @code{File} menu, select @code{Open Workspace}.
@item
Open the @file{mysql.dsw} workspace you find in the work directory.
@item
From the @code{Build} menu,
select the @code{Set Active Configuration} menu.
@item
Click over the screen selecting @code{mysqld - Win32 Debug}
and click OK.
@item
Press @code{F7} to begin the build of the debug server, libraries, and
some client applications.
@c @item
@c When the compilation finishes, copy the libraries and the executables
@c to a separate directory.
@item
Compile the release versions that you want, in the same way.
@item
Debug versions of the programs and libraries are placed in the
@file{client_debug} and @file{lib_debug} directories.
Release versions of the programs and libraries are placed in the
@file{client_release} and @file{lib_release} directories.
Note that if you want to build both debug and release versions,
you can select the ``build all'' option from the @code{Build} menu.
@item
Test the server.  The server built using the preceding instructions
will expect that the MySQL base directory and data directory are
@file{C:\mysql} and @file{C:\mysql\data} by default. If you want
to test your server using the source tree root directory and its
data directory as the base directory and data directory, you will
need to tell the server their pathnames. You can either do this on
the command line with the @code{--basedir} and @code{--datadir}
options, or place appropriate options in an option file (@file{C:\my.cnf}
or the @file{my.ini} file in your Windows directory). If you have
an existing data directory elsewhere that you want to use, you can
specify its pathname instead.
@item
Start your server from the @file{client_release} or @file{client_debug}
directory, depending on which server you want to use. The
general server startup instructions are at @ref{Windows installation}.
You'll need to to adapt the instructions appropriately if you
want to use a different base directory or data directory.
@item
When the server is running in standalone fashion or as a service
based on your configuration, try to connect to it from the @code{mysql}
interactive command-line utility that exists in your @file{client_release}
or @file{client_debug} directory.

@end enumerate

When you are satisfied that the programs you have built are working
correctly, stop the server. Then install MySQL as follows:

@enumerate
@item
Create the directories where you want to install MySQL.  For example,
to install into
@file{C:\mysql}, use these commands:

@example
C:
mkdir \mysql
mkdir \mysql\bin
mkdir \mysql\data
mkdir \mysql\share
mkdir \mysql\scripts
@end example

If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you should
also create several additional directories:

@example
mkdir \mysql\include
mkdir \mysql\lib
mkdir \mysql\lib\debug
mkdir \mysql\lib\opt
@end example

If you want to benchmark MySQL, create this directory:

@example
mkdir \mysql\sql-bench
@end example

Benchmarking requires Perl support.

@item
From the @file{workdir} directory, copy into the @code{C:\mysql} directory the
following directories:

@example
copy client_release\*.exe C:\mysql\bin
copy client_debug\mysqld.exe C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-debug.exe
xcopy scripts\*.* C:\mysql\scripts /E
xcopy share\*.* C:\mysql\share /E
@end example

If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL, you should
also copy several libraries and header files:

@example
copy lib_debug\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\debug
copy lib_debug\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
copy lib_debug\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
copy lib_release\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\opt
copy lib_release\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
copy lib_release\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
copy include\*.h C:\mysql\include
copy libmysql\libmysql.def C:\mysql\include
@end example

If you want to benchmark MySQL, you should also do this:

@example
xcopy sql-bench\*.* C:\mysql\bench /E
@end example

@end enumerate

Set up and start the server in the same way as for the binary
Windows distribution.
@xref{Windows installation}.

@subsubsection Creating a Windows Source Package from the Latest Development Source


To create a Windows source package from the current
BitKeeper source tree, use the following instructions. Please
note that this procedure must be performed on a system
running a Unix or Unix-like operating system.  (The procedure
is known to work well on Linux, for example.)

@enumerate
@item
Clone the BitKeeper source tree for MySQL (version 4.1 or above,
as desired).  For more information on how to clone the source tree,
see the instructions at @ref{Installing source tree}.

@item
Configure and build the distribution so that you have a server
binary to work with.  One way to do this is to run the following
command in the top-level directory of your source tree:

@example
shell> ./BUILD/compile-pentium-max
@end example

@item
After making sure that the build process completed successfully,
run the following utility script from top-level directory of your
source tree:

@example
shell> ./scripts/make_win_src_distribution
@end example

This script creates a Windows source package, to be used on your
Windows system.  You can supply different options to the script
based on your needs. It accepts the following options:

@example
--debug   Print information about script operations,
          do not create package
--tmp     Specify the temporary location
--suffix  Suffix name for the package
--dirname Directory name to copy files (intermediate)
--silent  Do not print verbose list of files processed
--tar     Create tar.gz package instead of .zip package
--help    Show this help message
@end example

By default, @code{make_win_src_distribution} creates a zipped
archive with the name @file{mysql-VERSION-win-src.zip}, where
@code{VERSION} represents the version of your MySQL source tree.
 
@item
Copy or upload to your Windows machine the Windows source package
that you have just created. To compile it, use the instructions in
@ref{Windows VC++ Build}.

@end enumerate

@cindex Windows, compiling on

In your source files, you should include @file{my_global.h} before
@file{mysql.h}:

@example
#include <my_global.h>
#include <mysql.h>
@end example

@file{my_global.h} includes any other files needed for Windows compatibility
(such as @file{windows.h}) if you compile your program on Windows.

You can either link your code with the dynamic @file{libmysql.lib} library,
which is just a wrapper to load in @file{libmysql.dll} on demand, or link
with the static @file{mysqlclient.lib} library.

The MySQL client libraries are compiled as threaded
libraries, so you should also compile your code to be multi-threaded.

There are some issues you should address after installing MySQL.  For
example, on Unix, you should initialize the data directory and create the
MySQL grant tables.  On all platforms, an important security concern is that
the initial accounts in the grant tables have no passwords.  You should
assign passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the MySQL server.

The following sections describe post-installation procedures for Windows
systems and for Unix systems.

@menu
* Windows post-installation::   Windows Post-Installation Procedures
* Unix post-installation::      Unix Post-Installation Procedures
@end menu

@node Windows post-installation, Unix post-installation, Post-installation, Post-installation
@subsection Windows Post-Installation Procedures

On Windows, the data directory and the grant tables do not have to be
created. MySQL Windows distributions include the grant tables already set up
with a set of preinitialized accounts in the @code{mysql} database under the
data directory.  However, you should assign passwords to the accounts.

The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges to
all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL more secure, you
should set a password for at least the @code{root} accounts. You should also
remove the row in the @code{mysql.user} table that has
@code{Host='localhost'} and @code{User=''}. This account allows anonymous
access but has full privileges, so removing it improves security.

The following example shows how to remove the anonymous-user account that
has all privileges, and then assigns a password to the @code{root} accounts:

@example
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> QUIT
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password "newpwd"
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root -h host_name password "newpwd"
@end example

Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that
you want to use.  The double quotes are not always necessary, but they are
helpful if the password contains spaces or other characters that are special
to your command interpreter. In the second @code{mysqladmin} command,
replace @code{host_name} with the name of the server host.

After you've assigned a password to the @code{root} accounts, you'll need to
specify it whenever you run a MySQL client program to connect to the server
as @code{root}. For example, if you want to use @code{mysqladmin} to shut
down the server, you can do so using this command:

@example
C:\> mysqladmin --user=root -p shutdown
@end example

If you are using a server from a @emph{very} old version of MySQL,
the @code{mysqladmin} command to set the
password will fail with an error:  @code{parse error near 'SET
password'}.  The solution to this problem is to upgrade the server to a newer
version of MySQL.

With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users
and change privileges with @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} commands.
@xref{GRANT, , @code{GRANT}}.

@c TODO: Many of the testing commands actually are not specific to Unix,
@c so they could be split out into a platform-neutral testing procedure...

After you install MySQL on Unix, you need to initialize the grant tables,
start the server, and make sure that the server works okay.  You may also
wish to arrange for the server to be started and stopped automatically when
your system starts and stops.

The grant tables on Unix are set up by the @code{mysql_install_db} program.
For some installation methods, this program is run for you automatically:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you install MySQL on Linux using RPM distributions, the server RPM runs
@code{mysql_install_db}.
@item
If you install MySQL on Mac OS X using a PKG distribution, the installer runs
@code{mysql_install_db}.
@end itemize

Otherwise, you'll need to run @code{mysql_install_db} yourself.

The following procedure describes how to initialize the grant tables and
then start the server. It also suggests some commands that you can use to
test whether the server is accessible and working properly.  For information
about starting and stopping the server automatically, see @ref{Automatic
start}.

In the examples shown here, the server runs under the user ID of the
@code{mysql} login account. This assumes that such an account exists.
Either create the account if it does not exist, or substitute the name of a
different existing login account that you plan to use for running the
server.

After you complete the procedure and have the server running, you should
assign passwords to the accounts created by @code{mysql_install_db}.
Instructions for doing so are given in @ref{Default privileges}.

@cindex starting, the server
@cindex server, starting
@cindex testing, installation

@enumerate
@item
Change location into the top-level directory of your MySQL installation,
represented here by @code{BASEDIR}:

@example
shell> cd BASEDIR
@end example

@code{BASEDIR} is likely to be something like @file{/usr/local/mysql} or
@file{/usr/local}.  The following steps assume that you are located in this
directory.

@item
If necessary, set up the initial
MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
users are allowed to connect to the server. You'll need to do this if you used
a distribution type that doesn't do it for you.
To initialize the grant tables, run the
@code{mysql_install_db} script:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you installed MySQL using a binary distribution, use this command:

@example
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
@end example

@item
If you installed MySQL using a source distribution, use this command:

@example
shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
@end example

@end itemize

The @code{mysql_install_db} script creates the @code{mysql} database that
holds all database privileges, and the @code{test} database that you can use
to test MySQL. The script also creates privilege table entries for
@code{root} accounts and anonymous-user accounts.  The accounts have no
passwords initially.  A description of their initial privileges is given in
@ref{Default privileges}.  Briefly, these privileges allow the MySQL
@code{root} user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or use
databases with a name of @code{test} or starting with @code{test_}.

It is important to make sure that the database directories and files are
owned by the @code{mysql} login account so that the server has read and
write access to them when you run it later. To ensure this, the @code{--user}
option should be used as shown if you run @code{mysql_install_db} as
@code{root}. Otherwise, you should execute the script while logged in as
@code{mysql}, in which case you can omit the @code{--user} option from the
command.

@code{mysql_install_db} creates several tables in the @code{mysql} database:
@code{user}, @code{db}, @code{host}, @code{tables_priv},
@code{columns_priv}, @code{func}, and possibly others depending on your
version of MySQL.

If you don't want to have the @code{test} database, you can remove it with
@code{mysqladmin -u root drop test} after starting the server.

Typically, @code{mysql_install_db} needs to be run only the first time you
install MySQL, so you can skip this step if you are upgrading an existing
installation, However, @code{mysql_install_db} does not overwrite any
existing privilege tables, so it should be safe to run in any circumstances.

If you have problems with @code{mysql_install_db}, see
@ref{mysql_install_db, , @code{mysql_install_db}}.

There are some alternatives to running the @code{mysql_install_db}
script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:

@cindex grant tables, re-creating
@cindex re-creating, grant tables

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you want the initial privileges to be different from the standard
defaults, you can modify @code{mysql_install_db} before you run it.
However, a preferable technique is to use @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} to
change the privileges after the grant tables have been set up.  In other
words, you can run @code{mysql_install_db}, and then use @code{mysql -u root
mysql} to connect to the server as the MySQL @code{root} user so that you
can issue the @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements.

If you want to install MySQL on a lot of machines with the
same privileges, you can put the @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements in
a file and execute the file as a script using @code{mysql} after running
@code{mysql_install_db}. For example:

@example
shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> bin/mysql -u root < your_script_file
@end example

By doing this, you can avoid having to issue the statements manually on each
machine.

@item
It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after they have
already been created.  You might want to do this if you're just learning how
to use @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} and have made so many modifications
after running @code{mysql_install_db} that you want to wipe out the tables
and start over.

To re-create the grant tables, remove all the @file{.frm}, @file{.MYI}, and
@file{.MYD} files in the directory containing the @code{mysql} database.
(This is the directory named @file{mysql} under the data directory, which is
listed as the @code{datadir} value when you run @code{mysqld --help}.) Then
run the @code{mysql_install_db} script again.

@strong{Note:} For MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10, you should not
delete the @file{.frm} files.  If you accidentally do this, you should copy
them back into the @file{mysql} directory from your MySQL distribution
before running @code{mysql_install_db}.

@item
You can start @code{mysqld} manually using the @code{--skip-grant-tables}
option and add the privilege information yourself using @code{mysql}:

@example
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql --skip-grant-tables &
shell> bin/mysql mysql
@end example

From @code{mysql}, manually execute the SQL commands contained in
@code{mysql_install_db}.  Make sure that you run @code{mysqladmin
flush-privileges} or @code{mysqladmin reload} afterward to tell the server to
reload the grant tables.

Note that by not using @code{mysql_install_db}, you not only have to
populate the grant tables manually, you have to create them first.
@end itemize

@item
Start the MySQL server:

@example
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, substitute @code{bin/safe_mysqld}
for @code{bin/mysqld_safe} in this command.

It is important that the MySQL server be run using an unprivileged
(non-@code{root}) login account.  To ensure this, the @code{--user}
option should be used as shown if you run @code{mysql_safe} as
@code{root}. Otherwise, you should execute the script while logged in as
@code{mysql}, in which case you can omit the @code{--user} option from the
command.

Further instructions for running MySQL as an unprivileged user are given in
@ref{Changing MySQL user}.

If you neglected to create the grant tables before proceeding to this step,
the following message will appear in the error log file when you start the
server:

@tindex host.frm, problems finding
@example
mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'
@end example

If you have other problems starting the server, see @ref{Starting server}.

@item
Use @code{mysqladmin} to verify that the server is running.  The following
commands provide simple tests to check whether the server is up and responding
to connections:

@example
shell> bin/mysqladmin version
shell> bin/mysqladmin variables
@end example

The output from @code{mysqladmin version} varies slightly depending on your
platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that shown here:

@example
shell> bin/mysqladmin version

To see what else you can do with @code{mysqladmin},
invoke it with the @code{--help} option.

@item
Verify that you can shut down the server:
@cindex server, shutdown
@cindex shutting down, the server

@example
shell> bin/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

@item
Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this by using @code{mysqld_safe} or
by invoking @code{mysqld} directly.  For example:

@cindex server, restart
@cindex restarting, the server

@example
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql --log &
@end example

If @code{mysqld_safe} fails, see @ref{Starting server}.

@item
Run some simple tests to verify that you can retrieve information from the
server.  The output should be similar to what is shown here:

@example
shell> bin/mysqlshow
+-----------+
| Databases |
+-----------+
| mysql     |
| test      |
+-----------+

shell> bin/mysqlshow mysql

| %    | test_% |      |
+------+--------+------+
@end example

@item
There is a benchmark suite in the @file{sql-bench} directory (under the
MySQL installation directory) that you can use to compare how
MySQL performs on different platforms. The benchmark suite is written in
Perl. It uses the Perl DBI module to provide a database-independent interface
to the various databases, and some other additional Perl modules are required
to run the benchmark suite. You must have the following modules installed:

@example
DBI
DBD::mysql
Data::Dumper
Data::ShowTable
@end example

These modules can be obtained from CPAN @uref{http://www.cpan.org/}.
@xref{Perl installation}.

The @file{sql-bench/Results} directory contains the results from many runs
against different databases and platforms.  To run all tests, execute these
commands:

@example
shell> cd sql-bench
shell> perl run-all-tests
@end example

If you don't have the @file{sql-bench} directory, you probably installed MySQL
using RPM files other than the source RPM.  (The source RPM includes the
@file{sql-bench} benchmark directory.)  In this case, you must first install
the benchmark suite before you can use it.  Beginning with MySQL Version 3.22,
there are separate benchmark RPM files named
@file{mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm} that contain benchmark code and data.

If you have a source distribution, there are also tests in its @file{tests}
subdirectory that you can run. For example, to run @file{auto_increment.tst},
execute this command from the top-level directory of your source distribution:

@example
shell> mysql -vvf test < ./tests/auto_increment.tst
@end example

The expected result of the test can be found in the
@file{./tests/auto_increment.res} file.

@item
At this point, you should have the server running. None of the initial MySQL
accounts have a password, so you should assign passwords using the
instructions in @ref{Default privileges}.

@subsubsection Problems Running @code{mysql_install_db}
@cindex @code{mysql_install_db} script
@cindex scripts, @code{mysql_install_db}

The purpose of the @code{mysql_install_db} script is to generate new MySQL
privilege tables.  It will not overwrite existing MySQL privilege tables,
and it will not affect any other data.

If you want to re-create your privilege tables, first stop
the @code{mysqld} server if it's running. Then rename the @file{mysql}
directory under the data directory to save it, and then run
@code{mysql_install_db}.  For example:

@example
shell> mv mysql-data-directory/mysql mysql-data-directory/mysql-old
shell> mysql_install_db --user=mysql
@end example

This section lists problems you might encounter when you run
@code{mysql_install_db}:

@table @strong
@item @code{mysql_install_db} doesn't install the grant tables

You may find that @code{mysql_install_db} fails to install the grant
tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:

@example
Starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
mysqld ended
@end example

In this case, you should examine the error log file very carefully.  The log
should be located in the directory @file{XXXXXX} named by the error message,
and should indicate why @code{mysqld} didn't start.  If you don't understand
what happened, include the log when you post a bug report.
@xref{Bug reports}.

@item There is already a @code{mysqld} process running

This indicates that the server is already running, in which case the grant
tables probably have already been created. If so, you don't have to run
@code{mysql_install_db} at all because it need be run only once (when you
install MySQL the first time).

@item Installing a second @code{mysqld} server doesn't work when one server is running

This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL installation, but
want to put a new installation in a different location.  For example, you
might have a production installation already, but you want to create a
second installation for testing purposes.  Generally the problem that occurs
when you try to run a second server is that it tries to use a network
interface that is already in use by the first server.  In this case, you
will see one of the following error messages:

@example
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port:
Address already in use
Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...
@end example

For instructions on setting up multiple servers to run on the same machine,
see @ref{Multiple servers}.

@item You don't have write access to @file{/tmp}
@cindex write access, tmp
@cindex temporary file, write access
@cindex files, @code{tmp}

If you don't have write access to create temporary files or a Unix socket
file in the default location (the @file{/tmp} directory), an error will
occur when you run @code{mysql_install_db} or the @code{mysqld} server.

You can specify different temporary directory and Unix socket file locations
by executing these commands prior to starting @code{mysql_install_db} or
@code{mysqld}:

@tindex TMPDIR environment variable
@tindex MYSQL_UNIX_PORT environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, TMPDIR
@tindex Environment variable, MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
@example
shell> TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysql.sock
shell> export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
@end example

@file{some_tmp_dir} should be the full pathname to some directory for which you
have write permission.

After this, you should be able to run @code{mysql_install_db} and start
the server with these commands:

@example
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &
@end example

See @ref{Problems with mysql.sock,  , Problems with @file{mysql.sock}}.
@xref{Environment variables}.

@node Automatic start, Starting server, mysql_install_db, Unix post-installation
@subsubsection Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically

@cindex starting, the server automatically
@cindex stopping, the server
@cindex server, starting and stopping

Generally, you start the @code{mysqld} server in one of these ways:

@itemize @bullet

@item
By invoking @code{mysqld} directly. This works on any platform.

@item
By running the MySQL server as a Windows service.
This can be done on versions of Windows that support services (such as
NT, 2000, and XP). The service can be set to start the server automatically
when Windows starts, or as a manual service that you start on request.
For instructions, see @ref{NT start}.

@item
By invoking @code{mysqld_safe}, which tries to determine the proper options
for @code{mysqld} and then runs it with those options.  This script is
used on systems based on BSD Unix.
@xref{mysqld_safe, , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

@item
By invoking @code{mysql.server}.  This script is used primarily at
system startup and shutdown on systems that use System V-style run
directories, where it usually is installed under the name @code{mysql}.
The @code{mysql.server} script starts the server by invoking @code{mysqld_safe}.
@xref{mysql.server, , @code{mysql.server}}.

@item
On Mac OS X, you can install a separate MySQL Startup Item package to
enable the automatic startup of MySQL on system startup.
The Startup Item starts the server by invoking @code{mysql.server}.
See @ref{Mac OS X installation} for details.

@end itemize

The @code{mysql.server} and @code{mysqld_safe} scripts and the Mac OS X
Startup Item can be used to start the server manually, or automatically at
system startup time. @code{mysql.server} and the Startup Item also can be
used to stop the server.

To start or stop the server manually using the @code{mysql.server} script,
invoke it with @code{start} or @code{stop} arguments:

@example
shell> mysql.server start
shell> mysql.server stop
@end example

Before @code{mysql.server} starts the server, it changes location to the
MySQL installation directory, and then invokes @code{mysqld_safe}.  If you
want the server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate @code{user}
option to the @code{[mysqld]} group of the @file{/etc/my.cnf} option file,
as shown later in this section.
(It is possible that you'll need to edit @code{mysql.server}
if you've installed a binary distribution of MySQL in a non-standard
location.  Modify it to @code{cd} into the proper directory before it runs
@code{mysqld_safe}.  If you do this, your modified version of
@code{mysql.server} may be overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future,
so you should make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.)

@code{mysql.server stop} brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can also stop the server manually by executing @code{mysqladmin
shutdown}.

To start and stop MySQL automatically on your server, you need to add start
and stop commands to the appropriate places in your @file{/etc/rc*} files.

Note that if you use the Linux server RPM package
(@code{MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm}), the @code{mysql.server} script will
already have been installed in the @file{/etc/init.d} directory with the
name @file{mysql}. You need not install it manually. See
@ref{Linux-RPM} for more information on the Linux RPM packages.

If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary
distribution format that does not install @code{mysql.server} automatically,
you can install it manually. The script can be found in the
@file{support-files} directory under the MySQL installation directory or in
a MySQL source tree.

To install @code{mysql.server} manually, copy it to the @file{/etc/init.d}
directory with the name @code{mysql}, and then make it executable.  Do this
by changing location into the appropriate directory where
@code{mysql.server} is located and executing these commands:

@example
shell> cp mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql
shell> chmod +x /etc/init.d/mysql
@end example

Older Red Hat systems use the @file{/etc/rc.d/init.d} directory rather than
@file{/etc/init.d}. Adjust the preceding commands accordingly, or else
first create @file{/etc/init.d} as a symbolic link that points to
@file{/etc/rc.d/init.d}.

After installing the script, the commands needed to activate it to run
at system startup depend on your operating system.  On Linux, you can use
@code{chkconfig}:

@example
shell> chkconfig --add mysql
@end example

On some Linux systems, the following command also seems to be necessary to
fully enable the @code{mysql} script:

@example
shell> chkconfig --level 345 mysql on
@end example

On FreeBSD, startup scripts generally should go in
@file{/usr/local/etc/rc.d/}. The @code{rc(8)} manual page states that
scripts in this directory are executed only if their basename matches the
@code{*.sh} shell filename pattern.  Any other files or directories present
within the directory are silently ignored. In other words, on FreeBSD you
should install the @file{mysql.server} script as
@file{/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql.server.sh} to enable automatic startup.

As an alternative to the preceding setup, some operating systems also use
@file{/etc/rc.local} or @file{/etc/init.d/boot.local} to start additional
services on startup. To start up MySQL using this method, you could append
a command like the one following to the appropriate startup file:

@example
/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &'
@end example

For other systems, consult your operating system documentation to see how
to install startup scripts.

@cindex changing socket location
You can add options for @code{mysql.server} in a global
@file{/etc/my.cnf} file.  A typical @file{/etc/my.cnf} file might look like
this:

@example
[mysqld]
datadir=/usr/local/mysql/var
socket=/var/tmp/mysql.sock
port=3306
user=mysql

[mysql.server]
basedir=/usr/local/mysql
@end example

The @code{mysql.server} script understands the following options:
@code{basedir}, @code{datadir}, and @code{pid-file}.  If specified, they
@emph{must} be placed in an option file, not on the command line.
@code{mysql.server} understands only @code{start} and @code{stop} as
command-line arguments.

The following table shows which option groups the server and each startup
script reads from option files:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @strong{Script} @tab @strong{Option Groups}
@item @code{mysqld} @tab @code{[mysqld]}, @code{[server]} and @code{[mysqld-major-version]}
@item @code{mysql.server} @tab @code{[mysql.server]} and @code{[mysqld]}
@item @code{mysqld_safe} @tab @code{[mysqld]}, @code{[server]}, and @code{[mysqld_safe]}
@end multitable

@code{[mysqld-major-version]} means that groups with names like
@code{[mysqld-4.0]}, @code{[mysqld-4.1]}, and @code{[mysqld-5.0]} will be
read by servers having versions 4.0.x, 4.1.x, 5.0.x, and so forth.  This
feature was added in MySQL 4.0.14. It can be used to specify options that will
be read only by servers within a given release series.

For backward compatibility, @code{mysql.server} also reads the
@code{[mysql_server]} group and @code{mysqld_safe} also reads the
@code{[safe_mysqld]} group. However, you should update your option
files to use the @code{[mysql.server]} and @code{[mysqld_safe]} groups instead
when you begin using MySQL 4.0 or later.

@xref{Option files}.

@subsubsection Starting and Troubleshooting the MySQL Server

@cindex problems, starting the server

If you have problems starting the server, here are some things you can try:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Specify any special options needed by the storage engines you are using.

@item
Make sure that the server knows where to find the data directory.

@item
Check the error log to see why the server doesn't start.

@item
Verify that the network interfaces the server wants to use are available.

@item
Check the ownership and permissions of the data directory and its contents.
They must be set such that the server can access and modify them.

@end itemize

Some storage engines have options that control their behavior.
You can create a @file{my.cnf} file and set startup options
for the engines you plan to use.
If you are going to use storage engines that support transactional tables
(@code{InnoDB}, @code{BDB}), be sure you have them configured the
way you want before starting the server:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are using @code{InnoDB} tables, refer to the @code{InnoDB}-specific
startup options.  In MySQL 3.23, you must configure @code{InnoDB} explicitly
or the server will fail to start.  From MySQL 4.0 on, @code{InnoDB} uses default
values for its configuration options if you specify none.
@xref{InnoDB configuration,  , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.

@item
If you are using @code{BDB} (Berkeley DB) tables, you should familiarize
yourself with the different @code{BDB}-specific startup options.
@xref{BDB start}.

@end itemize

When the @code{mysqld} server starts, it changes location to the data
directory.  This is where it expects to find databases and where it expects
to write log files. On Unix, the server also writes the pid (process ID)
file in the data directory.

The data directory location is hardwired in when the server is compiled.
This is where the server looks for the data directory by default. If
the data directory is located somewhere else on your system, the server will
not work properly.  You can find out what the default path settings are by
invoking @code{mysqld} with the @code{--verbose} and @code{--help} options.
(Prior to MySQL 4.1, omit the @code{--verbose} option.)

If the defaults don't match the MySQL installation layout on your system,
you can override them by specifying options on the command line to
@code{mysqld} or @code{mysqld_safe}. You can also list the options in an
option file.

To specify the location of the data directory explicitly, use the
@code{--datadir} option. However, normally you can tell @code{mysqld} the
location of the base directory under which MySQL is installed and it will
look for the data directory there.  You can do this with the @code{--basedir}
option.

To check the effect of specifying path options, invoke @code{mysqld} with
those options followed by the @code{--verbose} and @code{--help} options.
For example, if you change location into the directory where @code{mysqld} is
installed, and then run the following command, it
will show the effect of starting the server with a base
directory of @file{/usr/local}:

@example
shell> ./mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --verbose --help
@end example

You can specify other options such as @code{--datadir} as well, but note
that @code{--verbose} and @code{--help} must be the last options.  (Prior to
MySQL 4.1, omit the @code{--verbose} option.)

Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
@code{--verbose} and @code{--help}.

If @code{mysqld} is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

@example
shell> mysqladmin variables
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -h 'your-host-name' variables
@end example

Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the error log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically
@file{C:\mysql\data} on Windows,
@file{/usr/local/mysql/data} for a Unix binary distribution, and
@file{/usr/local/var} for a Unix source distribution).
Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form @file{host_name.err} and
@file{host_name.log}, where @code{host_name} is the name of your server
host. (Older servers on Windows use @file{mysql.err} as the error log name.)
Then check the last few lines of these files.
On Unix, you can use @code{tail} to display the last few lines:

@example
shell> tail host_name.err
shell> tail host_name.log
@end example

The error log contains information that indicates why the server couldn't
start.  For example, you might see something like this in the error log:

@example
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  Recovery function for LSN 1 27595 failed
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  warning: ./test/t1.db: No such file or directory
000729 14:50:10  Can't init databases
@end example

This means that you didn't start @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--bdb-no-recover} option and Berkeley DB found something wrong with
its own log files when it tried to recover your databases.  To be able to
continue, you should move away the old Berkeley DB log files from the
database directory to some other place, where you can later examine them.
The @code{BDB} log files are named in sequence beginning with
@file{log.0000000001}, where the number increases over time.

If you are running @code{mysqld} with @code{BDB} table support and
@code{mysqld} dumps core at startup, this could be due to problems with the
@code{BDB} recovery log.  In this case, you can try starting @code{mysqld}
with @code{--bdb-no-recover}.  If that helps, then you should remove
all @code{BDB} log files from the data directory and try starting @code{mysqld}
again without the @code{--bdb-no-recover} option.

If either of the following errors occur, it means that some other program
(perhaps another @code{mysqld} server) is already using the TCP/IP port or
Unix socket file that @code{mysqld} is trying to use:

@example
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
Can't start server: Bind on unix socket...
@end example

Use @code{ps} to determine whether you have another @code{mysqld} server
running. If so, shut down the server before starting @code{mysqld} again.
(If another server is running, and you really want to run multiple servers,
you can find information about how to do so in @ref{Multiple servers}.)

If no other server is running, try to execute the command @code{telnet
your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number}.  (The default MySQL port number is
3306.) Then press Enter a couple of times.  If you don't get an error
message like @code{telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection
refused}, some other program is using the TCP/IP port that @code{mysqld} is
trying to use.  You'll need to track down what program this is and disable
it, or else tell @code{mysqld} to listen to a different port with the
@code{--port} option.  In this case, you'll also need to specify the port
number for client programs when connecting to the server via TCP/IP.

If you get @code{Errcode 13} (which means @code{Permission denied}) when
starting @code{mysqld}, this means that the access privileges of the data
directory or its contents do not allow the server access.  In this case you
change the permissions for the involved files and directories so that the
server has the right to use them.  You can also start the server as
@code{root}, but this can raise security issues and should be avoided.

If @code{mysqld_safe} starts the server but you can't connect to it,
you should make sure that you have an entry in @file{/etc/hosts} that looks like
this:

@example
127.0.0.1       localhost
@end example

This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

If you can't get @code{mysqld} to start you can try to make a trace file
to find the problem. @xref{Making trace files}.


@node Upgrade, Operating System Specific Notes, Post-installation, Installing
@section Upgrading/Downgrading MySQL

@cindex upgrading
@cindex downgrading

As a general rule, we recommend that when upgrading from one release series to
another, you should go to the next series rather than skipping a series. For
example, if you currently are running MySQL 3.23 and wish to upgrade to a
newer series, upgrade to MySQL 4.0 rather than to 4.1 or 5.0.

The following items form a checklist of things you should do whenever you
perform an upgrade:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Read the change log for the release series to which you are upgrading to see
what new features you can use. For example, before upgrading from MySQL 4.1 to
5.0, read the 5.0 news items.

@item
Before you do an upgrade, you should back up your old databases.

@item
If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, see @ref{Windows upgrading}.

@item
If you are using replication, see @ref{Replication Upgrade}
for information on upgrading your replication setup.

@item
After upgrading, be sure your grant tables are up to date.  (These are the
tables in the @code{mysql} database.) Occasionally new columns or tables are
added to support new features.  To take advantage of these features, your
tables must be current.  The upgrade procedure is described in
@ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

@end itemize


You can always move the MySQL format files and data files between different
versions on the same architecture as long as you stay within versions for
the same release series of MySQL. The current production release series is
4.0. If you change the character set when running MySQL, you must run
@code{myisamchk -r -q --set-character-set=charset} on all tables.
Otherwise, your indexes may not be ordered correctly, because changing the
character set may also change the sort order.

If you upgrade or downgrade from one release series to another, there may be
incompatibilities in table storage formats. In this case, you can use
@code{mysqldump} to dump your tables before upgrading. After upgrading, reload
the dump file using @code{mysql} to re-create your tables.

If you are cautious about using new versions, you can always rename your old
@code{mysqld} before installing a newer one. For example, if you are using
MySQL 4.0.18 and want to upgrade to 4.1.1, rename your current server from
@code{mysqld} to @code{mysqld-4.0.18}.  If your new @code{mysqld} then does
something unexpected, you can simply shut it down and restart with your old
@code{mysqld}.

If, after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client programs,
such as @code{Commands out of sync} or unexpected core dumps, you probably have
used old header or library files when compiling your programs.  In this
case you should check the date for your @file{mysql.h} file and
@file{libmysqlclient.a} library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs with the new
headers and libraries.

If problems occur, such as that the new @code{mysqld} server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, verify that you don't
have some old @file{my.cnf} file from your old installation.  You can
check this with: @code{program-name --print-defaults}.  If this outputs
anything other than the program name, you have an active @file{my.cnf}
file that affects server or client operation.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the Perl @code{DBD::mysql}
module whenever you install a new release of MySQL. The same applies to other
MySQL interfaces as well, such as the Python @code{MySQLdb} module.

@subsection Upgrading from Version 4.0 to 4.1

@cindex compatibility, between MySQL versions
@cindex upgrading, 4.0 to 4.1

In general, you should do the following when upgrading to MySQL 4.1 from an
earlier version:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Check the items in the change list found later in this section to see whether
any of them might affect your applications.

@item
Read the 4.1 news items to see what significant new features you can use in 4.1.
@xref{News-4.1.x}.

@item
If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, see @ref{Windows upgrading}.

@strong{Important note:}
Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1 do not contain any
installer program.  See @ref{Windows binary installation} for instructions on
how to install such a distribution.

@item
If you are using replication, see @ref{Replication Upgrade}
for information on upgrading your replication setup.

@item
After upgrading, update the grant tables to have the new longer
@code{Password} column that is needed for secure handling of passwords.  The
procedure uses @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} and is described in
@ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.  Implications of the password-handling change
for applications are given later in this section.  If you don't do this,
MySQL will not us the new more secure protocol to authenticate.

@item
The Berkeley DB table handler is updated to DB 4.1 (from 3.2) which has
a new log format. If you have to downgrade back to 4.0 you must use
@code{mysqldump} to convert your BDB tables to text format and delete
all @code{log.??????} files before you start MySQL 4.0 and read back
the data.

@item
String comparison now works according to SQL standard; Instead of
stripping end space before comparison we now extend the shorter string
with space.  The problem with this is that now @code{'a' > 'a\t'},
which it wasn't before.  If you have any tables where you
have a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} column where the last char in the
column may be less than @code{ASCII(32)} you should use @code{REPAIR TABLE} or
@code{myisamchk} to ensure that the table is correct.

@item
If you have table columns that store character data represented in a
character set that the 4.1 server now supports directly, you can convert the
columns to the proper character set using the instructions in
@ref{Charset-conversion}.

@item
Some API calls such as @code{mysql_real_query()} now return @code{1} on error,
not @code{-1}.  You may have to change some old applications if they use
constructs like this:

@example
if (mysql_real_query(mysql_object, query, query_length) == -1)
@{
  printf("Got error");
@}
@end example

Change the call to test for a nonzero value instead:

@example
if (mysql_real_query(mysql_object, query, query_length) != 0)
@{
  printf("Got error");
@}
@end example

@item
If you are using an old @code{DBD-mysql} module
(@code{Msql-MySQL-modules}) you have to upgrade to use the newer
@code{DBD-mysql} modules. Anything above @code{DBD-mysql-2} should be fine.

If you don't upgrade, some commands (such as @code{DBI->do()}) will not
notice error conditions correctly.

@item
Option @code{--defaults-file=option-file-name} will now give an error if
the option file doesn't exists.
@end itemize

Several visible behaviors have changed between MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1 to fix
some critical bugs and make MySQL more compatible with the ANSI SQL
standard. These changes may affect your applications.

Some of the 4.1 behaviors can be tested in 4.0 before performing
a full upgrade to 4.1. We have added to later MySQL 4.0 releases
(from 4.0.12 on) a @code{--new} startup option for @code{mysqld}.
@xref{Server options}.

This option gives you the 4.1 behavior for the most critical changes.
You can also enable these behaviors for a given client connection with
the @code{SET @@@@new=1} command, or turn them off if they are on with
@code{SET @@@@new=0}.

@c TODO: preceding para means there is a global/session variable named "new"
@c that should be listed under system variables.

If you believe that some of the 4.1 changes will affect you,
we recommend that before upgrading to 4.1, you download
the latest MySQL 4.0 version and run it with the @code{--new} option by
adding the following to your config file:

@example
[mysqld-4.0]
new
@end example

That way you can test the new behaviors in 4.0 to make sure that your
applications work with them. This will help you have a smooth painless
transition when you perform a full upgrade to 4.1 later. Putting the
@code{--new} option in the @code{[mysqld-4.0]} option group ensures
that you don't accidentally later run the 4.1
version with the @code{--new} option.

The following list describes changes that may affect applications and that
you should watch out for when upgrading to version 4.1:

@strong{Server Changes:}

@itemize @bullet

@item
All tables and string columns now have a character set.
@xref{Charset}.
Character set information is displayed by
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} and @code{mysqldump}.
(MySQL versions 4.0.6 and above can read the new dump files; older
versions cannot.)
This change should not affect applications that uses only one character set.

@item
The table definition format used in @file{.frm} files
has changed slightly in 4.1.  MySQL 4.0 versions from 4.0.11 on can
read the new @file{.frm} format directly, but older versions cannot.
If you need to move tables from 4.1 to a version earlier than 4.0.11, you
should use @code{mysqldump}.
@xref{mysqldump, , @code{mysqldump}}.

@item
@strong{Important note:} If you upgrade to InnoDB-4.1.1 or higher, it is
difficult to downgrade back to 4.0 or 4.1.0! That is because earlier
versions of @code{InnoDB} are not aware of multiple tablespaces.

@item
If you are running multiple servers on the same Windows machine, you should
use a different @code{--shared_memory_base_name} option for each server.

@item
The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. You must now
declare a @code{xxx_clear()} function for each aggregate function @code{XXX()}.

@end itemize

@strong{SQL Changes:}

@itemize @bullet

@item
When using @code{DELETE} with many tables, you have to use the alias of
the tables from which you want to delete, not the actual table name.

@example
Change:

DELETE test FROM test AS t1, test2 WHERE ...

to

DELETE t1 FROM test AS t1, test2 WHERE ...
@end example
@item
@code{TIMESTAMP} is now returned as a string in @code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'}
format.  (The @code{--new} option can be used from 4.0.12 on to
make a 4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this respect.)  If you want to have
the value returned as a number (like Version 4.0 does) you should add +0 to
@code{TIMESTAMP} columns when you retrieve them:

@example
mysql> SELECT ts_col + 0 FROM tbl_name;
@end example

Display widths for @code{TIMESTAMP} columns are no longer supported.
For example, if you declare a column as @code{TIMESTAMP(10)}, the @code{(10)}
is ignored.

These changes were necessary for SQL standards compliance. In a future
version, a further change will be made (backward compatible with this
change), allowing the timestamp length to indicate the desired number of
digits for fractions of a second.

@item
Binary values such as @code{0xFFDF} now are assumed to be strings instead of
numbers.  This fixes some problems with character sets where it's
convenient to input a string as a binary value.  With this change,
you should use @code{CAST()} if you want to compare binary values
numerically as integers:

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST(0xFEFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER)
    ->        < CAST(0xFF AS UNSIGNED INTEGER);
        -> 0
@end example

If you don't use @code{CAST()}, a lexical string comparison will be done:

@example
mysql> SELECT 0xFEFF < 0xFF;
        -> 1
@end example

Using binary items in a numeric context or comparing them using the
@code{=} operator should work as before.  (The @code{--new} option can
be used from 4.0.13 on to make a 4.0 server behave as 4.1 in this respect.)

@item
For functions that produce a @code{DATE}, @code{DATETIME}, or @code{TIME}
value, the result returned to the client now is fixed up to have a temporal
type. For example, in MySQL 4.1, you get this result:

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST('2001-1-1' as DATETIME);
    -> '2001-01-01 00:00:00'
@end example

In MySQL 4.0, the result is different:

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST('2001-1-1' as DATETIME);
    -> '2001-01-01'
@end example

@item
@code{DEFAULT} values no longer can be specified for @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
columns. (In 4.0, a @code{DEFAULT} value is silently ignored; in 4.1,
an error occurs).

@item
@code{LIMIT} no longer accept negative arguments.
Use 18446744073709551615 instead of -1.

@item
@code{SERIALIZE} is no longer a valid mode value for the @code{sql_mode}
variable.  You should use @code{SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE}
instead. @code{SERIALIZE} is no longer valid for the @code{--sql-mode} option
for @code{mysqld}, either. Use @code{--transaction-isolation=SERIALIZABLE}
instead.

@end itemize

The password hashing mechanism has changed in 4.1 to provide better
security, but this may cause compatibility problems if you still have
clients that use the client library from 4.0 or earlier.  (It is very likely that you will
have 4.0 clients in situations where clients connect from remote hosts
that have not yet upgraded to 4.1).  The following list indicates some
possible upgrade strategies.  They represent various tradeoffs between
the goal of compatibility with old clients and the goal of security.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Only upgrade the client to use 4.1 client libraries (not the server). No
behavior will change (except the return value of some API calls), but
you cannot use any of the new features provided by the 4.1 client/server
protocol, either.  (MySQL 4.1 has an extended client/server protocol
that offers such features as prepared statements and multiple result
sets.)  @xref{C API Prepared statements}.

@item
Upgrade to 4.1 and run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script
to widen the @code{Password} column in the @code{user} table so
that it can hold long password hashes.  But run the server with the
@code{--old-passwords} option to provide backward compatibility that
allows pre-4.1 clients to continue to connect to their short-hash
accounts.
Eventually, when all your clients are upgraded to 4.1, you can stop using the
@code{--old-passwords} server option. You can also change the passwords for
your MySQL accounts to use the new more secure format.

@item
Upgrade to 4.1 and run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script to widen the
@code{Password} column in the @code{user} table.  If you know that all clients
also have been upgraded to 4.1, don't run the server with the
@code{--old-passwords} option.  Instead, change the passwords on all existing
accounts so that they have the new format.  A pure-4.1 installation
is the most secure.

@end itemize

Further background on password hashing with respect to client authentication
and password-changing operations may be found in @ref{Password hashing}.

@subsection Upgrading from Version 3.23 to 4.0

@cindex compatibility, between MySQL versions
@cindex upgrading, 3.23 to 4.0

In general, you should do the following when upgrading to MySQL 4.0 from an
earlier version:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Check the items in the change list found later in this section to see whether
any of them might affect your applications.

@item
Read the 4.0 news items to see what significant new features you can use in 4.0.
@xref{News-4.0.x}.

@item
If you are running MySQL Server on Windows, see @ref{Windows upgrading}.

@item
If you are using replication, see @ref{Replication Upgrade}
for information on upgrading your replication setup.

@item
After upgrading,
update the grant tables to add new privileges and features.  The
procedure uses the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script and is described
in @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

@item
Edit any MySQL startup scripts or option files to not use any of the
deprecated options described later in this section.

@item
Convert your old @code{ISAM} files to @code{MyISAM} files. One way to do this
is with the
@code{mysql_convert_table_format} script. (This is a Perl script;
it requires that DBI be installed.) To convert the tables in a given database,
use this command:

@example
shell> mysql_convert_table_format database db_name
@end example

Note that this should only be used if all tables in the given database
are @code{ISAM} or @code{MyISAM} tables. To avoid converting tables
of other types to @code{MyISAM}, you can explicitly list the names
of your @code{ISAM} tables after the database name on the command
line.

Individual tables can be changed to @code{MyISAM} by using the following
@code{ALTER TABLE} statement for each table to be converted:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE=MyISAM;
@end example

If you are not sure of the table type for a given table, use this statement:

@example
mysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tbl_name';
@end example

@item
Ensure that you don't have any MySQL clients that use shared libraries
(like the Perl @code{DBD::mysql} module). If you do, you should recompile
them, because the data structures used in @file{libmysqlclient.so} have changed.
The same applies to other MySQL interfaces as well, such as the Python
@code{MySQLdb} module.

@end itemize

MySQL 4.0 will work even if you don't perform the preceding actions, but you
will not be able to use the new security privileges in MySQL 4.0, and you
may run into problems when upgrading later to MySQL 4.1 or newer.  The
@code{ISAM} file format still works in MySQL 4.0, but is deprecated and
is not compiled in by default as of MySQL 4.1. @code{MyISAM} tables should
be used instead.

Old clients should work with a Version 4.0 server without any problems.

Even if you perform the preceding actions, you can still downgrade to MySQL
3.23.52 or newer if you run into problems with the MySQL 4.0 series.  In
this case, you must use @code{mysqldump} to dump any tables that use
full-text indexes and reload the dump file into the 3.23 server.  This is
necessary because 4.0 uses a new format for full-text indexing.

The following is a more complete list that tells what you must watch out
for when upgrading to version 4.0:

@strong{Server Changes:}

@itemize @bullet

@item
MySQL 4.0 has a lot of new privileges in the @code{mysql.user} table.
@xref{GRANT, , @code{GRANT}}.

To get these new privileges to work, you must update the grant tables.
The procedure is described in @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.
Until you do this, all
accounts have the @code{SHOW DATABASES}, @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES},
and @code{LOCK TABLES} privileges. @code{SUPER} and @code{EXECUTE}
privileges take their value from @code{PROCESS}.
@code{REPLICATION SLAVE} and @code{REPLICATION CLIENT} take their
values from @code{FILE}.

If you have any scripts that create new MySQL user accounts, you may want to change
them to use the new privileges.  If you are not using @code{GRANT}
commands in the scripts, this is a good time to change your scripts to use
@code{GRANT} instead of modifying the grant tables directly.

From version 4.0.2 on, the option @code{--safe-show-database} is deprecated
(and no longer does anything). @xref{Privileges options}.

If you get @code{Access denied} errors for new users in version 4.0.2 and up, you
should check whether you need some of the new grants that you didn't need
before.  In particular, you will need @code{REPLICATION SLAVE}
(instead of @code{FILE}) for new slaves.

@item
@code{safe_mysqld} has been renamed to @code{mysqld_safe}.  For backward
compatibility, binary distributions will for some time include
@code{safe_mysqld} as a symlink to @code{mysqld_safe}.

@item
@code{InnoDB} support is now included by default in binary distributions.
If you build MySQL from source, @code{InnoDB} is configured in by default.
If you do not use @code{InnoDB} and want to save memory when running a
server that has @code{InnoDB} support enabled, use the @code{--skip-innodb}
server startup option. To compile MySQL without @code{InnoDB} support, run
@code{configure} with the @code{--without-innodb} option.

@item
Values for the startup parameters @code{myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size} and
@code{myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size} are now given in bytes
(they were given in megabytes before 4.0.3).

@item
@code{mysqld} now has the option @code{--temp-pool} enabled by default as this
gives better performance with some operating systems (most notably Linux).

@item
The @code{mysqld} startup options @code{--skip-locking} and
@code{--enable-locking} were renamed to @code{--skip-external-locking}
and @code{--external-locking}.

@item
External system locking of @code{MyISAM}/@code{ISAM} files is now
turned off by default.  Your can turn this on by doing

@item
@code{SHOW INDEX} has two more columns than it had in 3.23 (@code{Null} and
@code{Index_type}).

@item
The format of @code{SHOW OPEN TABLES} has changed.

@item
@code{ORDER BY col_name DESC} sorts @code{NULL} values last, as of
MySQL 4.0.11. In 3.23 and in earlier 4.0 versions, this was not
always consistent.

@item
@code{CHECK}, @code{LOCALTIME}, and @code{LOCALTIMESTAMP}
are now reserved words.

@item
@code{DOUBLE} and @code{FLOAT} columns now honor the
@code{UNSIGNED} flag on storage (before, @code{UNSIGNED} was ignored for
these columns).

@item
The result of all bitwise operators (@code{|}, @code{&}, @code{<<},
@code{>>}, and @code{~})) is now unsigned.  This may cause problems if you
are using them in a context where you want a signed result.
@xref{Cast Functions}.

@strong{Note:} when you use subtraction between integer values where
one is of type @code{UNSIGNED}, the result will be unsigned.  In other
words, before upgrading to MySQL 4.0, you should check your application
for cases where you are subtracting a value from an unsigned entity and
want a negative answer or subtracting an unsigned value from an
integer column. You can disable this behavior by using the
@code{--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION} option when starting
@code{mysqld}.  @xref{Cast Functions}.

@item
You should use integers to store values in @code{BIGINT} columns (instead
of using strings, as you did in MySQL 3.23).  Using strings will still
work, but using integers is more efficient.

@item
In 3.23, @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT} always had @code{IGNORE} enabled.
In 4.0.1, MySQL will stop (and possibly roll back) by default in case of
an error unless you specify @code{IGNORE}.

@item
You should use @code{TRUNCATE TABLE} when you want to delete all rows
from a table and you don't need to obtain a count of the number of rows
that were deleted.  (@code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} returns a row count in
4.0 and doesn't reset the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} counter, and
@code{TRUNCATE TABLE} is faster.)

@item
You will get an error if you have an active @code{LOCK TABLES} or

@item
To use @code{MATCH ... AGAINST (... IN BOOLEAN MODE)} full-text searches
with your tables, you must rebuild their indexes with @code{REPAIR TABLE

rebuilding the indexes this way, the search will return incorrect results.
@xref{Fulltext Fine-tuning}.

@item
@code{LOCATE()} and @code{INSTR()} are case-sensitive if one of the
arguments is a binary string. Otherwise they are case-insensitive.

@item
@code{STRCMP()} now uses the current character set when performing comparisons.
This makes the default comparison behavior case insensitive unless
one or both of the operands are binary strings.

@item
@code{HEX(string)} now returns the characters in @code{string} converted to
hexadecimal.  If you want to convert a number to hexadecimal, you should
ensure that you call @code{HEX()} with a numeric argument.

@item
@code{RAND(seed)} returns a different random number series in 4.0 than in
3.23; this was done to further differentiate @code{RAND(seed)} and
@code{RAND(seed+1)}.

@item
The default type returned by @code{IFNULL(A,B)} is now set to be the
more ``general'' of the types of @code{A} and @code{B}. (The general-to-specific
order is: string, @code{REAL}, @code{INTEGER}).

@subsection Upgrading from Version 3.22 to 3.23

@cindex compatibility, between MySQL versions
@cindex upgrading, 3.22 to 3.23

MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new @code{MyISAM} type and the old
@code{ISAM} type.  By default, all new tables are created with type
@code{MyISAM} unless you start @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--default-table-type=isam} option.  You don't have to convert your old
@code{ISAM} tables to use them with Version 3.23.  You can convert an
@code{ISAM} table to @code{MyISAM} format with @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name
TYPE=MyISAM} or the Perl script @code{mysql_convert_table_format}.

Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a Version
3.23 server.

When upgrading to MySQL 3.23 from an earlier version, note the following
changes:

@strong{Client Program Changes:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
The MySQL client @code{mysql} is now by default started with the
option @code{--no-named-commands (-g)}. This option can be disabled with
@code{--enable-named-commands (-G)}. This may cause incompatibility problems in
some cases---for example, in SQL scripts that use named commands without a
semicolon.  Long format commands still work from the first line.

@item
If you want your @code{mysqldump} files to be compatible between
MySQL Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the
@code{--opt} or @code{--all} option to @code{mysqldump}.

@end itemize

@strong{Table Changes:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
All tables that use the @code{tis620} character set must be fixed
with @code{myisamchk -r} or @code{REPAIR TABLE}.

@item
If you are using the @code{german} character sort order for @code{ISAM}
tables, you must repair them with @code{isamchk -r}, because we have made
some changes in the sort order.

@end itemize

@strong{SQL Changes:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you do a @code{DROP DATABASE} on a symbolically linked database, both the
link and the original database are deleted.  (This didn't happen in 3.22
because @code{configure} didn't detect the availability of the
@code{readlink()} system call.)

@item
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} now works only for @code{MyISAM} tables.
For other table types, you can use @code{ALTER TABLE} to optimize the table.
During @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}, the table is now locked to prevent it from being
used by other threads.

@item
Date functions that work on parts of dates (like @code{MONTH()}) will now
return 0 for @code{0000-00-00} dates. (In MySQL 3.22, these functions returned
@code{NULL}.)

@item
The default return type of @code{IF()} now depends on both arguments
and not only the first argument.

@item
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns should not be used to store negative
numbers. The reason for this is that negative numbers caused problems
when wrapping from -1 to 0.  You should not store 0 in @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
columns, either; @code{CHECK TABLE} will complain about 0 values because
they may change if you dump and restore the table.  @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
for @code{MyISAM} tables is now handled at a lower level and is much
faster than before. In addition, for @code{MyISAM} tables, old numbers
are no longer reused, even if you delete rows from the table.

@item
@code{CASE}, @code{DELAYED}, @code{ELSE}, @code{END}, @code{FULLTEXT},
@code{INNER}, @code{RIGHT}, @code{THEN}, and @code{WHEN} are now reserved words.

@item
@code{FLOAT(X)} is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a
fixed number of decimals.

@item
When declaring columns using a @code{DECIMAL(length,dec)} type, the
@code{length} argument no longer includes a place for the sign or the
decimal point.

@item
A @code{TIME} string must now be of one of the following formats:
@code{[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]} or
@code{[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]}.

@item
@code{LIKE} now compares strings using the same character comparison rules
as for the @code{=} operator.  If you require the old behavior, you can
compile MySQL with the @code{CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER} flag.

@item
@code{REGEXP} is now case-insensitive if neither of the strings are binary
strings.

@item
When you check or repair @code{MyISAM} (@file{.MYI}) tables, you should use
the @code{CHECK TABLE} statement or the @code{myisamchk} command. For
@code{ISAM} (@file{.ISM}) tables, use the @code{isamchk} command.

@item
Check all your calls to @code{DATE_FORMAT()} to make sure that there is a
@samp{%} before each format character.
(MySQL Version 3.22 and later already allowed this syntax.)

@item
In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of @code{SELECT DISTINCT ...} was
almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use @code{GROUP BY} or
@code{ORDER BY} to obtain sorted output.

@item
@code{SUM()} now returns @code{NULL} instead of 0 if
there are no matching rows. This is required by standard SQL.

@item
An @code{AND} or @code{OR} with @code{NULL} values will now return
@code{NULL} instead of 0. This mostly affects queries that use @code{NOT}
on an @code{AND/OR} expression as @code{NOT NULL} = @code{NULL}.

@item
@code{LPAD()} and @code{RPAD()} now shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.

@end itemize

@strong{C API Changes:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysql_fetch_fields_direct()} is now a function (it used to be a macro) and
it returns a pointer to a @code{MYSQL_FIELD} instead of a
@code{MYSQL_FIELD}.

@item
@code{mysql_num_fields()} can no longer be used on a @code{MYSQL*} object (it's
now a function that takes a @code{MYSQL_RES*} value as an argument). With a
@code{MYSQL*} object, you should now use @code{mysql_field_count()} instead.

@subsection Upgrading from Version 3.21 to 3.22

@cindex compatibility, between MySQL versions
@cindex upgrading, 3.21 to 3.22

Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between versions 3.21 and 3.22.
The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with @code{DATE} type
columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't access these new
columns from an old version of @code{mysqld}.

When upgrading to MySQL 3.23 from an earlier version, note the following
changes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the @code{GRANT} command.  If you forget
this, you will get @code{Access denied} when you try to use @code{ALTER
TABLE}, @code{CREATE INDEX}, or @code{DROP INDEX}. The procedure for updating
the grant tables is described in @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

@item
The C API interface to @code{mysql_real_connect()} has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a @code{0} for
the new @code{db} argument (or recode the client to send the @code{db}
element for faster connections).  You must also call @code{mysql_init()}
before calling @code{mysql_real_connect()}.  This change was done to allow
the new @code{mysql_options()} function to save options in the @code{MYSQL}
handler structure.

@item
The @code{mysqld} variable @code{key_buffer} has been renamed to
@code{key_buffer_size}, but you can still use the old name in your
startup files.

@node Upgrading-from-3.20, Windows upgrading, Upgrading-from-3.21, Upgrade
@subsection Upgrading from Version 3.20 to 3.21

@cindex upgrading, 3.20 to 3.21

If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

You can start the @code{mysqld} Version 3.21 server with the
@code{--old-protocol} option to use it with clients from a Version 3.20
distribution.  In this case, the server uses the old pre-3.21
@code{password()} checking rather than the new method. Also, the new client
function @code{mysql_errno()} will not return any server error, only
@code{CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR}. The function does work for client errors.

If you are @strong{not} using the @code{--old-protocol} option to
@code{mysqld}, you will need to make the following changes:

@itemize @bullet

@item
All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you must get
the new @code{MyODBC} 2.x driver.

@item
The @code{scripts/add_long_password} script must be run to convert the
@code{Password} field in the @code{mysql.user} table to @code{CHAR(16)}.

@item
All passwords must be reassigned in the @code{mysql.user} table (to get 62-bit
rather than 31-bit passwords).

@item
The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any tables.

@end itemize

MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new @code{user} table
format without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier
than Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert the
@code{user} table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least Version
3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

@cindex Protocol mismatch
The new client code works with a 3.20.x @code{mysqld} server, so
if you experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

If you are not using the @code{--old-protocol} option to @code{mysqld},
old clients will be unable to connect and will issue the following error
message:

@example
ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9
@end example

The Perl DBI interface also supports the old
@code{mysqlperl} interface.  The only change you have to make if you use
@code{mysqlperl} is to change the arguments to the @code{connect()} function.
The new arguments are: @code{host}, @code{database}, @code{user},
and @code{password} (note that the @code{user} and @code{password} arguments
have changed places).

The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{HAVING} must now be specified before any @code{ORDER BY} clause.

@item
The parameters to @code{LOCATE()} have been swapped.

@item
There are some new reserved words. The most notable are @code{DATE},
@code{TIME}, and @code{TIMESTAMP}.

@subsection Upgrading MySQL under Windows

@cindex Windows, upgrading

When upgrading MySQL under Windows, please follow these steps:

@enumerate

@item
Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL.

@item
Choose a time of day with low usage, where a maintenance break is
acceptable.

@item
Alert the users who still are active about the maintenance break.

@item
Stop the running MySQL Server (for example, with @code{NET STOP MySQL} or with
the @code{Services} utility if you
are running MySQL as a service, or with @code{mysqladmin shutdown} otherwise).

@item
Exit the @code{WinMySQLAdmin} program if it is running.

@item
Run the installation script of the Windows distribution, by
clicking the "Install" button in WinZip and following the installation
steps of the script.

@strong{Important note:}
Early alpha Windows distributions for MySQL 4.1 do not contain any
installer program.  See @ref{Windows binary installation} for instructions on
how to install such a distribution.

@item
You may either overwrite your old MySQL installation (usually located at
@file{C:\mysql}), or install it into a different directory, such as
@code{C:\mysql4}. Overwriting the old installation is recommended.

@item
Restart the server. For example, use @code{NET START MySQL} if you run MySQL
as a service, or invoke @code{mysqld} directly otherwise.

@item
Update the grant tables. The procedure is described in
@ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

@end enumerate

Possible error situations:
@example
A system error has occurred.
System error 1067 has occurred.
The process terminated unexpectedly.
@end example

This error means that your @file{my.cnf} file (by default
@file{C:\my.cnf}) contains an option that cannot be recognized by
MySQL. You can verify that this is the case by trying to restart MySQL
with the @file{my.cnf} file renamed, for example, to @file{my_cnf.old} to
prevent the server from using it.  Once you have verified it, you need to
identify which option is the culprit. Create a new @file{my.cnf} file and
move parts of the old file to it (restarting the server after you move
each part) until you determine which option causes server startup to fail.


@node Upgrading-grant-tables, Upgrading-to-arch, Windows upgrading, Upgrade
@subsection Upgrading the Grant Tables

@cindex upgrading, grant tables
@cindex grant tables, upgrading

Some releases introduce changes to the structure of the grant tables
(the tables in the @code{mysql} database)
to add new  privileges or features. To make sure that your grant tables
are current when you update to a new version of MySQL, you should update
your grant tables as well.

On Unix or Unix-like systems, update the grant tables by running the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script:

@example
shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables
@end example

You must run this script while the server is running. It attempts to
connect to the server running on the local host as @code{root}.
If your @code{root} account requires a password, indicate the password
on the command line.  For MySQL 4.1 and up, specify the password like this:

@example
shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables --password=root_password
@end example

Prior to MySQL 4.1, specify the password like this:

@example
shell> mysql_fix_privilege_tables root_password
@end example

The @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script performs any actions
necessary to convert your grant tables to the current format. You
may see some @code{Duplicate column name} warnings as it runs; they
can be ignored.

After running the script, stop the server and restart it.

On Windows systems, there isn't an easy way to update the grant tables
until MySQL 4.0.15.  From version 4.0.15 on, MySQL distributions include a
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql} SQL script that you can run using
the @code{mysql} client.  If your MySQL installation is located at
@file{C:\mysql}, the commands look like this: 

@example
C:\mysql\bin> mysql -u root -p mysql
mysql> SOURCE C:\mysql\scripts\mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql
@end example

If your installation is located in some other directory, adjust the
pathnames appropriately.

The @code{mysql} command will prompt you for the @code{root} password; enter it
when prompted.

As with the Unix procedure, you may see some @code{Duplicate column name}
warnings as @code{mysql} processes the statements in the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sql} script; they can be ignored.

After running the script, stop the server and restart it.

@subsection Copying MySQL Databases to Another Machine

@cindex upgrading, different architecture
@cindex copying databases
@cindex databases, copying

If you are using MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can copy the @file{.frm},
@file{.MYI}, and @file{.MYD} files for @code{MyISAM} tables between different
architectures that support the same floating-point format.  (MySQL takes care
of any byte-swapping issues.)
@xref{MyISAM, , @code{MyISAM} Tables}.

The MySQL @code{ISAM} data and index files (@file{.ISD} and @file{*.ISM},
respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases operating
system-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another
machine that has a different architecture or operating system than your
current machine, you should not try to move a database by simply copying
the files to the other machine. Use @code{mysqldump} instead.

By default, @code{mysqldump} will create a file containing SQL statements.
You can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input
to the @code{mysql} client.

Try @code{mysqldump --help} to see what options are available.
If you are moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use
@code{mysqldump --opt} to take advantage of any optimizations that result
in a dump file that is smaller and can be processed faster.

The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between two
machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which the
database is located:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
shell> mysqldump --opt db_name \
        | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name
@end example

@c TODO: next example not only changes copy direction (from local->remote
@c to remote->local), it adds --compress.  But --compress is a separate
@c thing and can be used no matter the copy direction.  Split into two
@c examples.

If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow network,
you can use:

@example
shell> mysqladmin create db_name
shell> mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
        | mysql db_name
@end example

You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

@example
shell> mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip > db_name.contents.gz
@end example

(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these commands
there:

@example
shell> mysqladmin create db_name
shell> gunzip < db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name
@end example

@cindex @code{mysqldump}
@cindex @code{mysqlimport}
You can also use @code{mysqldump} and @code{mysqlimport} to transfer
the database.
For big tables, this is much faster than simply using @code{mysqldump}.
In the following commands, @code{DUMPDIR} represents the full pathname
of the directory you use to store the output from @code{mysqldump}.

First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

@example
shell> mkdir DUMPDIR
shell> mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name
@end example

Then transfer the files in the @code{DUMPDIR} directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL
there:

@example
shell> mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
shell> cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
shell> mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables
@end example

Also, don't forget to copy the @code{mysql} database because that's where the
grant tables (@code{user}, @code{db}, @code{host}) are stored.  You may have
to run commands as the MySQL @code{root} user on the new machine
until you have the @code{mysql} database in place.

After you import the @code{mysql} database on the new machine, execute
@code{mysqladmin flush-privileges} so that the server reloads the grant table
information.

@subsubsection Linux Operating System Notes

MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

@strong{Warning:}
We have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and MySQL on SMP
systems.  We also have reports from some MySQL users that they have
encountered serious stability problems using MySQL with kernel 2.2.14.
If you are using this kernel, you should upgrade to 2.2.19 (or newer) or to
a 2.4 kernel.  If you have a multiple-CPU box, then you should seriously
consider using 2.4 as this will give you a significant speed boost.
Your system also will be more stable.

@c TODO: this isn't really an "issue"; put in a FAQ somewhere:
@c "Why do I always see at least three mysqld processes on Linux?"

When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three @code{mysqld} processes
running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one thread for the
LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections, and one thread
to handle alarms and signals.

@subsubsection Linux Binary Distribution Notes

@cindex binary distributions, on Linux
@cindex Linux, binary distribution

The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured
for the highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest
stable compiler available.

The binary release is linked with @code{-static}, which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
@code{-static} is slightly larger than a dynamically linked program,
but also slightly faster (3-5%).  However, one problem with a statically
linked program is that you can't use user-defined functions (UDFs).
If you are going to write or use UDFs (this is something for C or C++
programmers only), you must compile MySQL yourself using dynamic linking.

A known issue with binary distributions is that on older Linux
systems that use @code{libc} (such as Red Hat 4.x or Slackware), you will get
some non-fatal problems with hostname resolution. If your system uses
@code{libc} rather than @code{glibc2},
you probably will encounter some difficulties with hostname resolution and
@code{getpwnam()}. This happens because @code{glibc}
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to implement hostname
resolution and @code{getpwent()}, even when compiled with @code{-static}).
These problems manifest themselves in two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You probably will see  the following error message when you run
@code{mysql_install_db}:

@example
Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up
@end example

You can deal with this by executing
@code{mysql_install_db --force}, which will not execute the
@code{resolveip} test in @code{mysql_install_db}.  The downside is that
you can't use hostnames in the grant tables: Except for @code{localhost},
you must use IP numbers instead.  If you are using an old version of MySQL
that doesn't support @code{--force}, you must manually remove the
@code{resolveip} test in @code{mysql_install} using an editor.

@item
You also may see
the following error when you try to run @code{mysqld} with the @code{--user}
option:

@example
getpwnam: No such file or directory
@end example

To work around this, start
@code{mysqld} with @code{su} rather than by specifying the @code{--user}
option. This causes the system itself to change the user ID of the
@code{mysqld} process so that @code{mysqld} need not do so.

@end itemize

Another solution, which solves both problems, is to not use a binary
distribution.  Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the @code{tar.gz}
distribution) and install that instead.

On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error @code{Resource
temporarily unavailable} when clients make a lot of new connections to
a @code{mysqld} server over TCP/IP.  The problem is that Linux has a
delay between the time that you close a TCP/IP socket and the time that
the system actually frees it.  There is only room for a finite number
of TCP/IP slots, so you will encounter the resource-unavailable error if
clients attempt too many new TCP/IP connections during a short time. For
example, you may see the error when you run the MySQL @file{test-connect}
benchmark over TCP/IP.

We have inquired about this problem a few times on different Linux mailing
lists but have never been able to find a suitable resolution.  The only
known ``fix'' is for the clients to use persistent connections, or,
if you are running the database server and clients on the same machine,
to use Unix socket file connections rather than TCP/IP connections.

@subsubsection Linux Source Distribution Notes

@cindex source distributions, on Linux
@cindex Linux, source distribution

The following notes regarding @code{glibc} apply only to the situation
when you build MySQL
yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine, in most cases it is
much better for you to just use our binary. We link our binaries against
the best patched version of @code{glibc} we can come up with and with the
best compiler options, in an attempt to make it suitable for a high-load
server.  For a typical user, even for setups with a lot of concurrent
connections or tables exceeding the 2GB limit, our binary is
the best choice in most cases.  After reading the following text, if you
are in doubt about what to do, try our binary first to see whether it meets
your needs.  If you discover that our binary is not good enough, then
you may want to try your own build.  In that case, we would appreciate
a note about it, so we can build a better binary next time.

MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old
Linux version that doesn't have @code{glibc2}, you must install
LinuxThreads before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get
LinuxThreads at @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html}.

Note that @code{glibc} versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have
a fatal bug in @code{pthread_mutex_timedwait()} handling, which is used
when you issue @code{INSERT DELAYED} statements.  We recommend that you not use
@code{INSERT DELAYED} before upgrading @code{glibc}.

Note that Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default
only have 1024 threads.  If you plan to have more than 1000 concurrent
connections, you will need to make some changes to LinuxThreads:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Increase @code{PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX} in
@file{sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h} to 4096 and decrease
@code{STACK_SIZE} in @file{linuxthreads/internals.h} to 256KB. The
paths are relative to the root of @code{glibc}. (Note that MySQL will
not be stable with around 600-1000 connections if @code{STACK_SIZE}
is the default of 2MB.)

@item
Recompile LinuxThreads to produce a new @file{libpthread.a} library,
and relink MySQL against it.

@end itemize

The page @uref{http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html} contains additional
information about circumventing thread limits in LinuxThreads.

There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance, especially on
SMP systems.  The mutex implementation in LinuxThreads in @code{glibc}
2.1 is very bad for programs with many threads that hold the mutex
only for a short time.  This produces a paradoxical result: If you link
MySQL against an unmodified LinuxThreads, removing processors from an
SMP actually improves MySQL performance in many cases.  We have made a
patch available for @code{glibc} 2.1.3 to correct this behavior
(@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch}).

With @code{glibc} 2.2.2,
MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex, which is much
better than even the patched one in @code{glibc} 2.1.3. Be warned, however,
that under some conditions, the current mutex code in @code{glibc} 2.2.2
overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The likelihood that this condition
will occur can be reduced by renicing the @code{mysqld} process to the highest
priority. We have also been able to correct the overspin behavior with
a patch, available at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch}.
It combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of
threads, and stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
@code{linuxthreads} directory with
@code{patch -p0 </tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch}.
We hope it will be included in
some form in future releases of @code{glibc} 2.2. In any case, if
you link against @code{glibc} 2.2.2, you still need to correct
@code{STACK_SIZE} and @code{PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}. We hope that the defaults
will be corrected to some more acceptable values for high-load
MySQL setup in the future, so that the commands needed to produce
your own build can be reduced to @code{./configure; make; make install}.

We recommend that you use these patches to build a special static
version of @code{libpthread.a} and use it only for statically linking
against MySQL. We know that the patches are safe for MySQL
and significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything
about other applications. If you link other applications that require
LinuxThreads against the
patched static version of the library, or build a patched shared version and
install it on your system, you are doing it at your own risk.

If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilities hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using our
binary will resolve them.

If you link your own MySQL client programs, you may see the following error at
runtime:

@example
ld.so.1: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
open failed: No such file or directory
@end example

This problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Link clients with the @code{-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so}
flag rather than with @code{-Lpath}).

@item
Copy @code{libmysqclient.so} to @file{/usr/lib}.

@tindex LD_RUN_PATH environment variable
@tindex environment variable, LD_RUN_PATH
@item
Add the pathname of the directory where @file{libmysqlclient.so} is located
to the @code{LD_RUN_PATH} environment variable before running your client.
@end itemize

If you are using the Fujitsu compiler (@code{fcc/FCC}), you will have
some problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very
@code{gcc} oriented.
The following @code{configure} line should work with @code{fcc/FCC}:

@example
CC=fcc CFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib -K omitfp -Kpreex -D_GNU_SOURCE \
    -DCONST=const -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO" \
CXX=FCC CXXFLAGS="-O -K fast -K lib \
    -K omitfp -K preex --no_exceptions --no_rtti -D_GNU_SOURCE \
    -DCONST=const -Dalloca=__builtin_alloca -DNO_STRTOLL_PROTO \
    '-D_EXTERN_INLINE=static __inline'" \
./configure \
    --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
    --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static --disable-shared \
    --with-low-memory
@end example


@node Linux-post-install, Linux-x86, Source notes-Linux, Linux
@subsubsection Linux Post-Installation Notes

@code{mysql.server} can be found in the @file{support-files} directory under
the MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source tree.  You can install
it as @file{/etc/init.d/mysql} for automatic MySQL startup and shutdown.
@xref{Automatic start}.

If MySQL can't open enough files or connections, it may be that
you haven't configured Linux to handle enough files.

In Linux 2.2 and onward, you can check the number of allocated
file handles as follows:

@example
shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
shell> cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max
@end example

If you have more than 16MB of memory, you should add something like the
following to your init scripts (for example, @file{/etc/init.d/boot.local} on SuSE Linux):

@example
echo 65536 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo 8192 > /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
echo 1024 > /proc/sys/fs/super-max
@end example

You can also run the @code{echo} commands from the command line as @code{root},
but these settings will be lost the next time your computer restarts.

Alternatively, you can set these parameters on startup by using the
@code{sysctl} tool, which is used by many Linux distributions (SuSE has
added it as well, beginning with SuSE Linux 8.0). Just put the following
values into a file named @file{/etc/sysctl.conf}:

@example
# Increase some values for MySQL
fs.file-max = 65536
fs.dquot-max = 8192
fs.super-max = 1024
@end example

You should also add the following to @file{/etc/my.cnf}:

@example
[mysqld_safe]
open-files-limit=8192
@end example

This should allow the server a limit of 8192 for the combined number of
connections and open files.

The @code{STACK_SIZE} constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there will
be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but small enough
to keep the stack of some threads from running into the global @code{mysqld}
data.  Unfortunately, as we have experimentally discovered, the Linux
implementation of @code{mmap()} will successfully unmap an already mapped
region if you ask it to map out an address already in use, zeroing out the data
on the entire page, instead of returning an error.  So, the safety of
@code{mysqld} or any other threaded application depends on ``gentlemanly''
behavior of the code that creates threads.  The user must take measures to
make sure that the number of running threads at any time is sufficiently low for
thread stacks to stay away from the global heap.  With @code{mysqld}, you
should enforce this behavior by setting a reasonable value for
the @code{max_connections} variable.

If you build MySQL yourself, you can patch LinuxThreads for better stack use.
@xref{Source notes-Linux}.
If you do not want to patch
LinuxThreads, you should set @code{max_connections} to a value no higher
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large
heap tables, or some other things that make @code{mysqld} allocate a lot
of memory, or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2GB patch. If you are
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
@code{max_connections} at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables
with lots of data.  The more you reduce @code{STACK_SIZE} in LinuxThreads
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend values between
128KB and 256KB.

If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a ``feature''
in the 2.2 kernel that attempts to prevent fork bomb attacks by penalizing
a process for forking or cloning a child.  This causes MySQL
not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent clients.  On
single-CPU systems, we have seen this manifested as very slow thread
creation: It may take a long time to connect to MySQL
(as long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it down.  On
multiple-CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in query speed as
the number of clients increases.  In the process of trying to find a
solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of our users who
claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The patch is available at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch}. We have
now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both development and
production systems.  It has significantly
improved MySQL performance without causing any problems and we now
recommend it to our users who still run high-load servers on
2.2 kernels.

This issue has been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not satisfied
with the current performance of your system, rather than patching
your 2.2 kernel, it might be easier to upgrade to 2.4. On SMP systems,
upgrading also will give you a nice SMP boost in addition to fixing the
fairness bug.

We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2-CPU machine and found MySQL
scales @strong{much} better. There was virtually no slowdown on query
throughput all the way up to 1000 clients, and the MySQL scaling factor
(computed as the ratio of maximum throughput to the throughput for one
client) was 180%.  We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system:
Virtually no slowdown as the number of clients was increased up to 1000,
and a 300% scaling factor. Based on these results, for a high-load SMP
server using a 2.2 kernel, we definitely recommend upgrading to the 2.4
kernel at this point.

We have discovered that it is essential to run @code{mysqld} process
with the highest possible priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum
performance.  This can be done by adding a @code{renice -20 $$} command
to @code{mysqld_safe}. In our testing on a 4-CPU machine, increasing
the priority gave 60% throughput increase with 400 clients.

We are currently also trying to collect more information on how well
MySQL performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way systems. If you have
access such a system and have done some benchmarks, please send an email
message to @email{benchmarks@@mysql.com} with the results. We will review
them for inclusion in the manual.

If you see a dead @code{mysqld} server process with @code{ps}, this usually
means that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted
table. @xref{Crashing}.

To get a core dump on Linux if @code{mysqld} dies with a @code{SIGSEGV} signal,
you can start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--core-file} option.  Note
that you also probably need to raise the @code{core file size} by adding
@code{ulimit -c 1000000} to @code{mysqld_safe} or starting
@code{mysqld_safe} with @code{--core-file-size=1000000}.
@xref{mysqld_safe, , @code{mysqld_safe}}.


@node Linux-x86, Linux-SPARC, Linux-post-install, Linux
@subsubsection Linux x86 Notes

MySQL requires @code{libc} Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to
work with @code{libc} 5.4.46.  @code{glibc} Version 2.0.6 and later should
also work. There have been some problems with the @code{glibc} RPMs from
Red Hat, so if you have problems, check whether there are any updates.
The @code{glibc} 2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

If you are using Red Hat 8.0 or a new @code{glibc} 2.2.x library, you may see
@code{mysqld} die in @code{gethostbyaddr()}. This happens because the new
@code{glibc} library requires a stack size greater than 128KB for this call.
To fix the problem, start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--thread-stack=192K}
option.  (Use @code{-O thread_stack=192K} before MySQL 4.)
This stack size is now the default on MySQL 4.0.10 and above, so you should
not see the problem.

If you are using @code{gcc} 3.0 and above to compile MySQL, you must install
the @code{libstdc++v3} library before compiling MySQL; if you don't do
this, you will get an error about a missing @code{__cxa_pure_virtual}
symbol during linking.

On some older Linux distributions, @code{configure} may produce an error
like this:

@example
Syntax error in sched.h. Change _P to __P in the
/usr/include/sched.h file.
See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.
@end example

Just do what the error message says. Add an extra underscore to the
@code{_P} macro name that has only one underscore, then try again.

You may get some warnings when compiling. Those shown here can be ignored:

@example
mysqld.cc -o objs-thread/mysqld.o
mysqld.cc: In function `void init_signals()':
mysqld.cc:315: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
`long unsigned int'
mysqld.cc: In function `void * signal_hand(void *)':
mysqld.cc:346: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
`long unsigned int'
@end example

If @code{mysqld} always dumps core when it starts, the problem may be that
you have an old @file{/lib/libc.a}.  Try renaming it, then remove
@file{sql/mysqld} and do a new @code{make install} and try again.  This
problem has been reported on some Slackware installations.

If you get the following error when linking @code{mysqld},
it means that your @file{libg++.a} is not installed correctly:

@example
/usr/lib/libc.a(putc.o): In function `_IO_putc':
putc.o(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `_IO_putc'
@end example

You can avoid using @file{libg++.a} by running @code{configure} like this:

@example
shell> CXX=gcc ./configure
@end example

If @code{mysqld} crashes immediately and
you are running Red Hat Version 5.0 with a version of @code{glibc} older than
2.0.7-5, you should make sure that you have installed all @code{glibc} patches.
There is a lot of information about this in the MySQL mail
archives.  Links to the mail archives are available online at
@uref{http://lists.mysql.com/}.

@subsubsection Linux Alpha Notes

MySQL Version 3.23.12 is the first MySQL version that is
tested on Linux-Alpha.  If you plan to use MySQL on Linux-Alpha,
you should ensure that you have this version or newer.

We have tested MySQL on Alpha with our benchmarks and test suite,
and it appears to work nicely. 

We currently build the MySQL binary packages on SuSE Linux 7.0 for AXP,
kernel 2.4.4-SMP, Compaq C compiler (V6.2-505) and Compaq C++ compiler
(V6.3-006) on a Compaq DS20 machine with an Alpha EV6 processor.

You can find the preceding compilers at
@uref{http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/}.  By using these compilers
rather than @code{gcc}, we get about 9-14% better MySQL performance.

Note that until MySQL version 3.23.52 and 4.0.2, we optimized the binary for
the current CPU only (by using the @code{-fast} compile option). This means
that for older versions, you can use our Alpha binaries only if you have an
Alpha EV6 processor.

For all following releases, we added the @code{-arch generic} flag
to our compile options, which makes sure that the binary runs on all Alpha
processors. We also compile statically to avoid library problems.
The @code{configure} command looks like this:

@example
CC=ccc CFLAGS="-fast -arch generic" CXX=cxx \
CXXFLAGS="-fast -arch generic -noexceptions -nortti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared \
    --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client \
    --with-mysqld-ldflags=-non_shared --with-client-ldflags=-non_shared
@end example

If you want to use @code{egcs}, the following @code{configure} line worked
for us:

@example
CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
    -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
@end example

Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with
@code{gdb 4.18}.  You should use @code{gdb} 5.1 instead!

@item
If you try linking @code{mysqld} statically when using @code{gcc}, the
resulting image will dump core at startup time.  In other words, @strong{don't}
use @code{--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static} with @code{gcc}.

(@code{egcs-1.0.2-9}, @code{gcc 2.95.2} or newer).


@node Linux-IA-64,  , Linux-MIPS, Linux
@subsubsection Linux IA-64 Notes

To get MySQL to compile on Linux IA-64, we use the following @code{configure}
command for building with @code{gcc} 2.96:

@example
CC=gcc \

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
    "--with-comment=Official MySQL binary" \
    --with-extra-charsets=complex
@end example

On IA-64, the MySQL client binaries use shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution at a location other than
@file{/usr/local/mysql}, you need to add the path of the directory
where you have @file{libmysqlclient.so} installed either to the
@file{/etc/ld.so.conf} file or to the value of your @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

For current versions of Mac OS X Server, no operating system changes are
necessary before compiling MySQL.  Compiling for the Server platform is
the same as for the client version of Mac OS X. (However, note that MySQL
comes preinstalled on Mac OS X Server, so you need not build it yourself.)

For older versions (Mac OS X Server 1.2, a.k.a. Rhapsody), you must
first install a pthread package before trying to configure MySQL.

@cindex Solaris installation problems
@cindex problems, installing on Solaris
@cindex tar, problems on Solaris
@cindex errors, directory checksum
@cindex checksum errors

On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris @code{tar} can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

@example
x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,\
informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
tar: directory checksum error
@end example

In this case, you must use GNU @code{tar} (@code{gtar}) to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html}.

Sun native threads only work on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version 2.4 and
earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.
@xref{MIT-pthreads}.

If you get the following error from @code{configure},
it means that you have something wrong with your compiler installation:

@example
checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not
run test programs while cross compiling
@end example

In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer version.  You may
also be able to solve this problem by inserting the following row into the
@file{config.cache} file:

@example
ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=$@{ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'@}
@end example

If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is
@code{gcc} 2.95.2 or 3.2. You can find this at @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/}.
Note that @code{egcs} 1.1.1 and @code{gcc} 2.8.1 don't work reliably on
SPARC!

The recommended @code{configure} line when using @code{gcc} 2.95.2 is:

@example
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory \
--enable-assembler
@end example

If you have an UltraSPARC system, you can get 4% better performance by adding
@code{-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa} to the @code{CFLAGS} and @code{CXXFLAGS}
environment variables.

If you have Sun's Forte 5.0 (or newer) compiler, you can
run @code{configure} like this:

@example
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
@end example

To create a 64-bit binary with Sun's Forte compiler, use the
following configuration options:

@example
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt -xarch=v9" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt -xarch=v9" ASFLAGS="-xarch=v9" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
@end example

To create a 64bit Solaris binary using @code{gcc}, add @code{-m64} to
@code{CFLAGS} and @code{CXXFLAGS}. Note that this works only with MySQL
4.0 and up - MySQL 3.23 does not include the required modifications to
support this.

In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 4% speedup on an UltraSPARC when using
Forte 5.0 in 32-bit mode compared to using @code{gcc} 3.2 with @code{-mcpu} flags.

If you create a 64-bit @code{mysqld} binary, it is 4% slower than the 32-bit
binary, but can handle more threads and memory.

If you get a problem with @code{fdatasync} or @code{sched_yield},
you can fix this by adding @code{LIBS=-lrt} to the configure line

For older compilers than WorkShop 5.3,
you may have to edit the @code{configure} script to change this line:

@example
#if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1
@end example

To this:

@example
#if !defined(__STDC__)
@end example

If you turn on @code{__STDC__} with the @code{-Xc} option, the Sun compiler
can't compile with the Solaris @file{pthread.h} header file.  This is a Sun
bug (broken compiler or broken include file).

If @code{mysqld} issues the following error message when you run it, you have
tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (@code{-mt}):

@example
libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held
@end example

Add @code{-mt} to @code{CFLAGS} and @code{CXXFLAGS} and recompile.

If you are using the SFW version of @code{gcc} (which comes with Solaris 8),
you must add @file{/opt/sfw/lib} to the environment variable
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} before running @code{configure}.

If you are using the @code{gcc} available from @code{sunfreeware.com}, you may
have many problems.  To avoid this, you should recompile @code{gcc} and GNU
@code{binutils} on the machine where you will be running them.

If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with @code{gcc},
it means that your @code{gcc} is not configured for your version of Solaris:

@example
shell> gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'
@end example

The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
@code{gcc} and compile it with your current @code{gcc} compiler!  At
least for Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of @code{gcc} have
old, unusable include files that will break all programs that use
threads, and possibly other programs!

Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(@code{libpthreads} and @code{libdl}), so you can't compile MySQL
with @code{--static}.  If you try to do so, you will get one of the following
errors:

@example
ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found
undefined reference to `dlopen'
cannot find -lrt
@end example

If you link your own MySQL client programs, you may see the following error at
runtime:

@example
ld.so.1: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
open failed: No such file or directory
@end example

This problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Link clients with the @code{-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so}
flag rather than with @code{-Lpath}).

@item
Copy @code{libmysqclient.so} to @file{/usr/lib}.

@tindex LD_RUN_PATH environment variable
@tindex environment variable, LD_RUN_PATH
@item
Add the pathname of the directory where @file{libmysqlclient.so} is located
to the @code{LD_RUN_PATH} environment variable before running your client.
@end itemize

If you have problems with @code{configure} trying to link with @code{-lz} when
you don't have @code{zlib} installed, you have two options:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you want to be able to use the compressed communication protocol,
you need to get and install @code{zlib} from @code{ftp.gnu.org}.

@item
Run @code{configure} with the @code{--with-named-z-libs=no} option when
building MySQL.
@end itemize

If you are using @code{gcc} and have problems with loading user-defined
functions (UDFs) into MySQL, try adding @code{-lgcc} to the link line
for the UDF.

If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
@file{support-files/mysql.server} to @file{/etc/init.d} and create a
symbolic link to it named @file{/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server}.

If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to @code{mysqld}, you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

@example
Error in accept: Protocol error
@end example

You might try starting the server with the @code{--back_log=50}
option as a workaround for this.  (Use @code{-O back_log=50} before MySQL 4.)

Solaris doesn't support core files for @code{setuid()} applications, so
you can't get a core file from @code{mysqld} if you are using the
@code{--user} option.

@end menu


@node Solaris 2.7, Solaris x86, Solaris, Solaris
@subsubsection Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes

You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to detect new versions of
Solaris automatically and enable workarounds for the following problems!

Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use @code{gcc}:

@example
/usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
/usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition
@end example

If this occurs, you can fix the problem by copying
@code{/usr/include/widec.h} to
@code{.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include} and changing line 41 from this:

@example
#if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint)
@end example

To this:

@example
#if     !defined(lint) && !defined(__lint) && !defined(getwc)
@end example

Alternatively, you can edit @file{/usr/include/widec.h} directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove @file{config.cache} and run
@code{configure} again!

If you get the following errors when you run @code{make}, it's because
@code{configure} didn't detect the @file{curses.h} file (probably
because of the error in @file{/usr/include/widec.h}):

@example
In file included from mysql.cc:50:
/usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
/usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'
@end example

The solution to this is to do one of the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Configure with @code{CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H ./configure}.

@item
Edit @file{/usr/include/widec.h} as indicated in the preceding discussion
and re-run @code{configure}.

@item
Remove the @code{#define HAVE_TERM} line from the @file{config.h} file and
run @code{make} again.
@end itemize

If your linker can't find @code{-lz} when linking
client programs, the problem is probably that your @file{libz.so} file is
installed in @file{/usr/local/lib}.  You can fix this by one of the
following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Add @file{/usr/local/lib} to @code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.

@item
Add a link to @file{libz.so} from @file{/lib}.

@item
If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional @code{zlib} from your
Solaris 8 CD distribution.

@item
Run @code{configure} with the @code{--with-named-z-libs=no} option when
building MySQL.
@end itemize


@node Solaris x86,  , Solaris 2.7, Solaris
@subsubsection Solaris x86 Notes

On Solaris 8 on x86, @code{mysqld} will dump core if you remove the
debug symbols using @code{strip}.

If you are using @code{gcc} or @code{egcs} on Solaris x86 and you
experience problems with core dumps under load, you should use the
following @code{configure} command:

@example
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
    -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
@end example

This will avoid problems with the @code{libstdc++} library and with C++
exceptions.

If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run
it with a trace file or under @code{gdb}.

@node FreeBSD, NetBSD, BSD Notes, BSD Notes
@subsubsection FreeBSD Notes

FreeBSD 4.x or newer is recommended for running MySQL, because the thread
package is much more integrated.
To get a secure and stable system, you should use only FreeBSD kernels
that are marked @code{-RELEASE}.

The easiest (and preferred) way to install MySQL is to use the
@code{mysql-server} and @code{mysql-client} ports available at
@uref{http://www.freebsd.org/}.
Using these ports gives you the following benefits:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A working MySQL with all optimizations enabled that are known to work on your
version of FreeBSD.

@item
Automatic configuration and build.

@item
Startup scripts installed in @file{/usr/local/etc/rc.d}.

@item
The ability to use @code{pkg_info -L} to see which files are installed.

@item
The ability to use @code{pkg_delete} to remove MySQL if you no longer want it
on your machine.
@end itemize

It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x, and native threads on
Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with native threads on some late
2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems shutting down @code{mysqld}.

Unfortunately, certain function calls on FreeBSD are not yet fully thread-safe.
Most notably, this includes the @code{gethostbyname()} function, which is
used by MySQL to convert hostnames into IP addresses. Under certain
circumstances, the @code{mysqld} process will suddenly cause 100%
CPU load and will be unresponsive. If you encounter this problem, try to start
up MySQL using the @code{--skip-name-resolve} option.

Alternatively, you can link MySQL on FreeBSD 4.x against the LinuxThreads
library, which avoids a few of the problems that the native FreeBSD thread
implementation has. For a very good comparison of LinuxThreads vs. native
threads, see Jeremy Zawodny's article @cite{FreeBSD or Linux for your
MySQL Server?} at
@uref{http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000697.html}.

A known problem when using LinuxThreads on FreeBSD is that
@code{wait_timeout} is not working (probably a signal handling problem in
FreeBSD/LinuxThreads).  This is supposed to be fixed in FreeBSD 5.0.
The symptom is that persistent connections can hang for a very long
time without getting closed down.

The MySQL build process require GNU make (@code{gmake}) to work.  If
GNU @code{make} is not available, you must install it first before compiling
MySQL.

The recommended way to compile and install MySQL on FreeBSD with
@code{gcc} (2.95.2 and up) is:

@example
shell> CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-strength-reduce" \
           CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions \
           -felide-constructors -fno-strength-reduce" \
           ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
shell> gmake
shell> gmake install
shell> cd /usr/local/mysql
shell> bin/mysql_install_db
shell> bin/mysqld_safe &
@end example

If you notice that @code{configure} will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  @xref{MIT-pthreads}.

If you get an error from @code{make install} that it can't find
@file{/usr/include/pthreads}, @code{configure} didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads. To fix this problem, remove @file{config.cache}, then re-run
@code{configure} with the @code{--with-mit-threads} option.

@c TODO: This is not really FreeBSD-specific. Move to general
@c troublshooting section.

Be sure your name resolver setup is correct.  Otherwise, you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to @code{mysqld}.
Also make sure that the @code{localhost} entry in the @file{/etc/hosts} file is
correct.  The file should start with a line similar to this:

@example
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain
@end example

FreeBSD is known to have a very low default file handle limit.
@xref{Not enough file handles}.  Start the server by using the
@code{--open-files-limit} option for @code{mysqld_safe}, or raise
the limits for the @code{mysqld} user in @file{/etc/login.conf} and
rebuild it with @code{cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf}.  Also be sure you set
the appropriate class for this user in the password file if you are not
using the default (use @code{chpass mysqld-user-name}).
@xref{mysqld_safe,  , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

If you have a lot of memory, you should consider rebuilding
the kernel to allow MySQL to use more than 512MB of RAM.
Take a look at @code{option MAXDSIZ} in the LINT config
file for more information.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
@code{TZ} variable will probably help.  @xref{Environment variables}.


@node NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, BSD Notes
@subsubsection NetBSD Notes

To compile on NetBSD you need GNU @code{make}. Otherwise, the build process will
fail when @code{make} tries to run @code{lint} on C++ files.


@node OpenBSD, OpenBSD 2.8, NetBSD, BSD Notes
@subsubsection OpenBSD 2.5 Notes

On OpenBSD Version 2.5, you can compile MySQL with native threads
with the following options:

@example
CFLAGS=-pthread CXXFLAGS=-pthread ./configure --with-mit-threads=no
@end example


@node OpenBSD 2.8, BSDI, OpenBSD, BSD Notes
@subsubsection OpenBSD 2.8 Notes

Our users have reported that OpenBSD 2.8 has a threading bug which causes
problems with MySQL.  The OpenBSD Developers have fixed the problem,
but as of January 25th, 2001, it's only available in the ``-current'' branch.
The symptoms of this threading bug are: slow response, high load, high CPU
usage, and crashes.

If you get an error like @code{Error in accept:: Bad file descriptor} or
error 9 when trying to open tables or directories, the problem is probably
that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for MySQL.

In this case, try starting @code{mysqld_safe} as @code{root} with the following
options:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --user=mysql --open-files-limit=2048 &
@end example

@node BSDI, BSDI3, OpenBSD 2.8, BSD Notes
@subsubsection BSD/OS Version 2.x Notes

If you get the following error when compiling MySQL, your
@code{ulimit} value for virtual memory is too low:

@example
item_func.h: In method
`Item_func_ge::Item_func_ge(const Item_func_ge &)':
item_func.h:28: virtual memory exhausted
make[2]: *** [item_func.o] Error 1
@end example

Try using @code{ulimit -v 80000} and run @code{make} again.  If this
doesn't work and you are using @code{bash}, try switching to @code{csh}
or @code{sh}; some BSDI users have reported problems with @code{bash}
and @code{ulimit}.

If you are using @code{gcc}, you may also use have to use the
@code{--with-low-memory} flag for @code{configure} to be able to compile
@file{sql_yacc.cc}.

If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
@code{TZ} variable will probably help.  @xref{Environment variables}.


@node BSDI3, BSDI4, BSDI, BSD Notes
@subsubsection BSD/OS Version 3.x Notes

Upgrade to BSD/OS Version 3.1.  If that is not possible, install
BSDIpatch M300-038.

Use the following command when configuring MySQL:

@example
shell> env CXX=shlicc++ CC=shlicc2 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
           --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
           --without-perl \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
@end example

The following is also known to work:

@example
shell> env CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
@end example

You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
@code{--skip-thread-priority} option to @code{mysqld}!  This will run
all threads with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

If you get the error @code{virtual memory exhausted} while compiling,
you should try using @code{ulimit -v 80000} and run @code{make} again.
If this doesn't work and you are using @code{bash}, try switching to
@code{csh} or @code{sh}; some BSDI users have reported problems with
@code{bash} and @code{ulimit}.


@node BSDI4,  , BSDI3, BSD Notes
@subsubsection BSD/OS Version 4.x Notes

BSDI Version 4.x has some thread-related bugs.  If you want to use
MySQL on this, you should install all thread-related patches.  At
least M400-023 should be installed.

On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared libraries.
The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs, for example,
@code{mysqladmin}.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to use
shared libraries with the @code{--disable-shared} option to configure.

Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the @code{mysqld}
binary after a while can't open tables.  This is because some
library/system related bug causes @code{mysqld} to change current
directory without asking for this!

The fix is to either upgrade MySQL to at least version 3.23.34 or, after
running @code{configure}, remove the line @code{#define HAVE_REALPATH} from
@code{config.h} before running @code{make}.

Note that this means that you can't symbolically link a database
directories to another database directory or symbolic link a table to
another database on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is okay).

@subsubsection HP-UX Version 10.20 Notes

There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on
HP-UX.  We recommend that you use @code{gcc} instead of the HP-UX native
compiler, because @code{gcc} produces better code!

We recommend using @code{gcc} 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimization
flags (like @code{-O6}) as they may not be safe on HP-UX.

The following @code{configure} line should work with @code{gcc} 2.95:

@example
CFLAGS="-I/opt/dce/include -fpic" \
CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti" \
CXX=gcc \
./configure --with-pthread \
    --with-named-thread-libs='-ldce' \
    --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
@end example

The following @code{configure} line should work with @code{gcc} 3.1:

@example
CFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -O3 -fPIC" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-DHPUX -I/opt/dce/include -felide-constructors \
    -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3 -fPIC" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
    --with-extra-charsets=complex --enable-thread-safe-client \
    --enable-local-infile  --with-pthread \
    --with-named-thread-libs=-ldce --with-lib-ccflags=-fPIC
    --disable-shared
@end example

@node HP-UX 11.x, IBM-AIX, HP-UX 10.20, Other Unix Notes
@subsubsection HP-UX Version 11.x Notes

For HP-UX Version 11.x, we recommend MySQL 3.23.15 or later.

Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you should
install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on HP-UX 11.0:

@example
PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative
@end example

This will solve the problem of getting @code{EWOULDBLOCK} from @code{recv()}
and @code{EBADF} from @code{accept()} in threaded applications.

If you are using @code{gcc} 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system,
you will get the error:

@example
In file included from /usr/include/unistd.h:11,
                 from ../include/global.h:125,

The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define @code{pthreads_atfork()} consistently.
It has conflicting prototypes in
@file{/usr/include/sys/unistd.h}:184 and
@file{/usr/include/sys/pthread.h}:440 (details below).

One solution is to copy @file{/usr/include/sys/unistd.h} into
@file{mysql/include} and edit @file{unistd.h} and change it to match
the definition in @file{pthread.h}.  Change this line:

@example
extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(), void (*parent)(),
                                          void (*child)());
@end example

To look like this:

@example
extern int pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(void), void (*parent)(void),
                                          void (*child)(void));
@end example

After making the change, the following @code{configure} line should work:

@example
CFLAGS="-fomit-frame-pointer -O3 -fpic" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -O3" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
@end example

If you are using MySQL 4.0.5 with the HP-UX compiler, you can use the following
command (which has been tested with @code{cc} B.11.11.04):

@example
CC=cc CXX=aCC CFLAGS=+DD64 CXXFLAGS=+DD64 ./configure \
    --with-extra-character-set=complex
@end example

You can ignore any errors of the following type:

@example
aCC: warning 901: unknown option: `-3': use +help for online
documentation
@end example

If you get the following error from @code{configure},
verify that you don't have the path to the K&R compiler before the path
to the HP-UX C and C++ compiler:

@example
checking for cc option to accept ANSI C... no
configure: error: MySQL requires a ANSI C compiler (and a C++ compiler).
Try gcc. See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.
@end example

Another reason for not being able to compile is that you didn't define
the @code{+DD64} flags as just described.

Another possibility for HP-UX 11 is to use MySQL binaries for HP-UX 10.20.
We have received reports from some users that these binaries work fine on
HP-UX 11.00. If you encounter problems, be sure to check your HP-UX patch
level.

@cindex problems, installing on IBM-AIX

Automatic detection of @code{xlC} is missing from Autoconf, so a number of
variables need to be set before running @code{configure}. The following
example uses the IBM compiler:

@example
export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
                --localstatedir=/var/mysql \
                --sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
                --sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
                --libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
                --enable-thread-safe-client \
                --enable-large-files
@end example

The preceding options are used to compile the MySQL distribution that
can be found at @uref{http://www-frec.bull.com/}.

If you change the @code{-O3} to @code{-O2} in the preceding @code{configure}
line, you must also remove the @code{-qstrict} option (this is a limitation in
the IBM C compiler).

If you are using @code{gcc} or @code{egcs} to compile MySQL, you
@strong{must} use the @code{-fno-exceptions} flag, because the exception
handling in @code{gcc}/@code{egcs} is not thread-safe!  (This is tested with
@code{egcs} 1.1.)  There are also some known problems with IBM's assembler
that may cause it to generate bad code when used with @code{gcc}.

We recommend the following @code{configure} line with @code{egcs} and
@code{gcc 2.95} on AIX:

@example
CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory
@end example

The @code{-Wa,-many} option is necessary for the compile to be successful.
IBM is aware of this problem but is in no hurry to fix it because of the
workaround that is available.  We don't know if the @code{-fno-exceptions}
is required with @code{gcc 2.95}, but because MySQL doesn't use exceptions
and the option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always
use it with @code{egcs / gcc}.

If you get a problem with assembler code, try changing the @code{-mcpu=xxx}
option to match your CPU. Typically @code{power2}, @code{power}, or
@code{powerpc} may need to be used.  Alternatively, you might need to use
@code{604} or @code{604e}. We are not positive but suspect that
@code{power} would likely be safe most of the time, even on
a power2 machine.

If you don't know what your CPU is, execute a @code{uname -m} command.  It
will produce a string that looks like @code{000514676700}, with a format of
@code{xxyyyyyymmss} where @code{xx} and @code{ss} are always @code{00},
@code{yyyyyy} is a unique system ID and @code{mm} is the ID of the CPU Planar.
A chart of these values can be found at
@uref{http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm}.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of CPU you have.

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals.  In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

@example
shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
       CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti \
       -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug \
           --with-low-memory
@end example

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
@code{mysqladmin kill} or @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

On some versions of AIX, linking with @code{libbind.a} makes
@code{getservbyname} core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported
to IBM.

For AIX 4.2.1 and @code{gcc}, you have to make the following changes.

After configuring, edit @file{config.h} and @file{include/my_config.h}
and change the line that says this:

@example
#define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1
@end example

to this:

@example
#undef HAVE_SNPRINTF
@end example

And finally, in @file{mysqld.cc} you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

@example
#ifdef _AIX41
extern "C" int initgroups(const char *,int);
#endif
@end example

If you need to allocate a lot of memory to the @code{mysqld} process, it's not
enough to just use @code{ulimit -d unlimited}. You may also have to modify
@code{mysqld_safe} to add a line something like this:

@example
export LDR_CNTRL='MAXDATA=0x80000000'
@end example

You can find more about using a lot of memory at:
@uref{http://publib16.boulder.ibm.com/pseries/en_US/aixprggd/genprogc/lrg_prg_support.htm}.

@node SunOS, Alpha-DEC-UNIX, IBM-AIX, Other Unix Notes
@subsubsection SunOS 4 Notes

On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL. This in turn
means you will need GNU @code{make}.

Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and @code{libtool}.
You can use the following @code{configure} line to avoid this problem:

@example
shell> ./configure --disable-shared --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
@end example

When compiling @code{readline}, you may get warnings about duplicate defines.
These may be ignored.

When compiling @code{mysqld}, there will be some @code{implicit declaration
of function} warnings. These may be ignored.


@node Alpha-DEC-UNIX, Alpha-DEC-OSF1, SunOS, Other Unix Notes
@subsubsection Alpha-DEC-UNIX Notes (Tru64)

If you are using @code{egcs} 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to
@code{gcc} 2.95.2, because @code{egcs} on DEC has some serious bugs!

When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the @code{-pthread} option for @code{cc} and @code{cxx} and
the @code{-lmach -lexc} libraries (in addition to @code{-lpthread}).  You
should run @code{configure} something like this:

@example
CC="cc -pthread" CXX="cxx -pthread -O" \
./configure --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"
@end example

When compiling @code{mysqld}, you may see a couple of warnings like this:

@example
mysqld.cc: In function void handle_connections()':
mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'
@end example

You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because @code{configure}
can detect only errors, not warnings.

If you start the server directly from the command line, you may have problems
with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your outstanding processes
receive a @code{SIGHUP} signal.)  If so, try starting the server like this:

@example
shell> nohup mysqld [options] &
@end example

@code{nohup} causes the command following it to ignore any @code{SIGHUP}
signal sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
@code{mysqld_safe}, which invokes @code{mysqld} using @code{nohup} for you.
@xref{mysqld_safe, , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

If you get a problem when compiling @file{mysys/get_opt.c}, just remove the
@code{#define _NO_PROTO} line from the start of that file!

If you are using Compaq's CC compiler, the following @code{configure} line
should work:

@example
CC="cc -pthread"
CFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all -arch host"
CXX="cxx -pthread"
CXXFLAGS="-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed all \
    -arch host -noexceptions -nortti"
export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
./configure \
    --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
    --with-low-memory \
    --enable-large-files \
    --enable-shared=yes \
    --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"
gnumake
@end example

If you get a problem with @code{libtool}, when compiling with shared libraries
as just shown, when linking @code{mysql}, you should be able to get around
this by issuing:

@example
cd mysql
/bin/sh ../libtool --mode=link cxx -pthread  -O3 -DDBUG_OFF \
    -O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed \
    -speculate all \ -arch host  -DUNDEF_HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R \
    -o mysql  mysql.o readline.o sql_string.o completion_hash.o \
    ../readline/libreadline.a -lcurses \
    ../libmysql/.libs/libmysqlclient.so  -lm
cd ..

@end example


@node Alpha-DEC-OSF1, SGI-Irix, Alpha-DEC-UNIX, Other Unix Notes
@subsubsection Alpha-DEC-OSF/1 Notes

If you have problems compiling and have DEC @code{CC} and @code{gcc}
installed, try running @code{configure} like this:

@example
CC=cc CFLAGS=-O CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
@end example

If you get problems with the @file{c_asm.h} file, you can create and use
a 'dummy' @file{c_asm.h} file with:

@example
touch include/c_asm.h
CC=gcc CFLAGS=-I./include \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
@end example

Note that the following problems with the @code{ld} program can be fixed
by downloading the latest DEC (Compaq) patch kit from:
@uref{http://ftp.support.compaq.com/public/unix/}.

On OSF/1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev. 878)"
the compiler had some strange behavior (undefined @code{asm} symbols).
@code{/bin/ld} also appears to be broken (problems with @code{_exit
undefined} errors occurring while linking @code{mysqld}).  On this system, we
have managed to compile MySQL with the following @code{configure}
line, after replacing @code{/bin/ld} with the version from OSF 4.0C:

@example
CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
@end example

With the Digital compiler "C++ V6.1-029", the following should work:

@example
CC=cc -pthread
CFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed \
       -speculate all -arch host
CXX=cxx -pthread
CXXFLAGS=-O4 -ansi_alias -ansi_args -fast -inline speed \
         -speculate all -arch host -noexceptions -nortti
export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
./configure --prefix=/usr/mysql/mysql \
            --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static --disable-shared \
            --with-named-thread-libs="-lmach -lexc -lc"
@end example

In some versions of OSF/1, the @code{alloca()} function is broken. Fix
this by removing the line in @file{config.h} that defines @code{'HAVE_ALLOCA'}.

The @code{alloca()} function also may have an incorrect prototype in
@code{/usr/include/alloca.h}.  This warning resulting from this can be ignored.

@code{configure} will use the following thread libraries automatically:
@code{--with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"}.

When using @code{gcc}, you can also try running @code{configure} like this:

@example
shell> CFLAGS=-D_PTHREAD_USE_D4 CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure ...
@end example

If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load), you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals. In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

@example
shell> CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
       CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM \
       ./configure ...
@end example

This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
@code{mysqladmin kill} or @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

With @code{gcc} 2.95.2, you will probably run into the following compile error:

@example
sql_acl.cc:1456: Internal compiler error in `scan_region',
at except.c:2566
Please submit a full bug report.
@end example

To fix this you should change to the @code{sql} directory and do a ``cut
and paste'' of the last @code{gcc} line, but change @code{-O3} to
@code{-O0} (or add @code{-O0} immediately after @code{gcc} if you don't
have any @code{-O} option on your compile line).  After this is done you
can just change back to the top-level directly and run @code{make}
again.


@node SGI-Irix, SCO, Alpha-DEC-OSF1, Other Unix Notes
@subsubsection SGI Irix Notes

If you are using Irix Version 6.5.3 or newer @code{mysqld} will be able to
create threads only if you run it as a user with @code{CAP_SCHED_MGT}
privileges (like @code{root}) or give the @code{mysqld} server this privilege
with the following shell command:

@example
shell> chcap "CAP_SCHED_MGT+epi" /opt/mysql/libexec/mysqld
@end example

You may have to undefine some symbols in @file{config.h} after running
@code{configure} and before compiling.

In some Irix implementations, the @code{alloca()} function is broken.  If the
@code{mysqld} server dies on some @code{SELECT} statements, remove the lines
from @file{config.h} that define @code{HAVE_ALLOC} and @code{HAVE_ALLOCA_H}.
If @code{mysqladmin create} doesn't work, remove the line from @file{config.h}
that defines @code{HAVE_READDIR_R}.  You may have to remove the
@code{HAVE_TERM_H} line as well.

SGI recommends that you install all of the patches on this page as a set:
@uref{http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_indigo.rps.html}

At the very minimum, you should install the latest kernel rollup, the
latest @code{rld} rollup, and the latest @code{libc} rollup.

You definitely need all the POSIX patches on this page, for pthreads support:

@uref{http://support.sgi.com/surfzone/patches/patchset/6.2_posix.rps.html}

If you get the something like the following error when compiling
@file{mysql.cc}:

@example
"/usr/include/curses.h", line 82: error(1084):
invalid combination of type
@end example

Type the following in the top-level directory of your MySQL source
tree:

@example
shell> extra/replace bool curses_bool < /usr/include/curses.h \
           > include/curses.h
shell> make
@end example

There have also been reports of scheduling problems.  If only one thread is
running, performance is slow.  Avoid this by starting another client.  This may
lead to a 2-to-10-fold increase in execution speed thereafter for the other
thread.  This is a poorly understood problem with Irix threads; you may have
to improvise to find solutions until this can be fixed.

If you are compiling with @code{gcc}, you can use the following
@code{configure} command:

@example
CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-thread-safe-client \
    --with-named-thread-libs=-lpthread
@end example

On Irix 6.5.11 with native Irix C and C++ compilers ver. 7.3.1.2, the
following is reported to work

@example
CC=cc CXX=CC CFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 -I/usr/local/include \
-L/usr/local/lib' CXXFLAGS='-O3 -n32 -TARG:platform=IP22 \

@subsubsection SCO Notes

The current port is tested only on ``sco3.2v5.0.5,'' ``sco3.2v5.0.6,'' 
and ``sco3.2v5.0.7'' systems.  There has also been a lot of progress on a
port to ``sco 3.2v4.2.''

For the moment the recommended compiler on OpenServer is @code{gcc} 2.95.2.
With this you should be able to compile MySQL with just:

@example
CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure ... (options)
@end example

@enumerate
@item
For OpenServer 5.0.x you need to use gcc-2.95.2p1 or newer from the
Skunkware.  @uref{http://www.sco.com/skunkware/} and choose browser
OpenServer packages or by ftp to ftp2.caldera.com in the
@file{pub/skunkware/osr5/devtools/gcc} directory.

@item
You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
system.  They are required on this version of SCO Unix.  You cannot
just use the GCC Dev system.

@item
You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.  
This can be found at
@uref{http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/ftp/pub/PART/pthreads.tar.gz}.
You can also get a precompiled package from
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz}.

@item
FSU Pthreads can be compiled with SCO Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the SCO 
Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or OS
3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of problems
without a good port.  The port for this product requires the SCO Unix
Development system.  Without it, you are missing the libraries and the
linker that is needed.

@item
To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Run @code{./configure} in the @file{threads/src} directory and select
the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies @file{Makefile.SCO5} to
@file{Makefile}.

@item
Run @code{make}.

@item
To install in the default @file{/usr/include} directory, login as root,
then @code{cd} to the @file{thread/src} directory, and run @code{make
install}.
@end enumerate

@item
Remember to use GNU @code{make} when making MySQL.

@item
If you don't start @code{mysqld_safe} as @code{root}, you probably will get only the
default 110 open files per process.  @code{mysqld} will write a note about this
in the log file.

@item
With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
You should also use @code{gcc} 2.95.2 or newer!

The following @code{configure} command should work:

@example
shell> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
@end example

@item
With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
The following @code{configure} command should work:

@example
shell> CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" \
   ./configure \
       --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
       --with-named-thread-libs="-lgthreads -lsocket -lgen -lgthreads" \
       --with-named-curses-libs="-lcurses"
@end example

You may get some problems with some include files. In this case, you can
find new SCO-specific include files at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/SCO-3.2v4.2-includes.tar.gz}.
You should unpack this file in the @file{include} directory of your
MySQL source tree.
@end enumerate

SCO development notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link @code{mysqld}
with @code{-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads}.

@item
The SCO development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.
SCO claims that its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must
be re-entrant with FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries to use
the SCO scheme to make re-entrant libraries.

@item
FSU Pthreads (at least the version at @uref{http://www.mysql.com/}) comes
linked with GNU @code{malloc}.  If you encounter problems with memory usage,
make sure that @file{gmalloc.o} is included in @file{libgthreads.a} and
@file{libgthreads.so}.

@item
In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware: @code{read()},
@code{write()}, @code{getmsg()}, @code{connect()}, @code{accept()},
@code{select()}, and @code{wait()}.

@item
The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (version 2.0.0) breaks FSU threads and
makes @code{mysqld} unstable.  You have to remove this one if you want to run
@code{mysqld} on an OpenServer 5.0.6 machine.

@item
SCO provides Operating Systems Patches at
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5} for OpenServer 5.0.x 

@item
SCO provides security fixes and @code{libsocket.so.2} at
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/OpenServer} and
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/security/sse} for OpenServer 5.0.x

@item
pre-OSR506 security fixes. Also, the @code{telnetd} fix at
@uref{ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openserver/} or
@uref{ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openserver/CSSA-2001-SCO.10/}
as both @code{libsocket.so.2} and @code{libresolv.so.1} with instructions for
installing on pre-OSR506 systems.

It's probably a good idea to install these patches before trying to
compile/use MySQL.

requirement of the Pthreads library.  MySQL must be installed
on a partition with a type that supports long filenames, such as HPFS, FAT32,
etc.

The @file{INSTALL.CMD} script must be run from OS/2's own @file{CMD.EXE}
and may not work with replacement shells such as @file{4OS2.EXE}.

The @file{scripts/mysql-install-db} script has been renamed.  It is now called
@file{install.cmd} and is a REXX script, which will set up the default
MySQL security settings and create the WorkPlace Shell icons
for MySQL.

Dynamic module support is compiled in but not fully tested. Dynamic
modules should be compiled using the Pthreads run-time library.

@example
gcc -Zdll -Zmt -Zcrtdll=pthrdrtl -I../include -I../regex -I.. \
    -o example udf_example.cc -L../lib -lmysqlclient udf_example.def
mv example.dll example.udf
@end example

@strong{Note:} Due to limitations in OS/2, UDF module name stems must not
exceed 8 characters. Modules are stored in the @file{/mysql2/udf}
directory; the @code{safe-mysqld.cmd} script will put this directory in
the @code{BEGINLIBPATH} environment variable. When using UDF modules,
specified extensions are ignored---it is assumed to be @file{.udf}.
For example, in Unix, the shared module might be named @file{example.so}
and you would load a function from it like this:

@example
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME 'example.so';
@end example

In OS/2, the module would be named @file{example.udf}, but you would not
specify the module extension:

@example
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME 'example';
@end example

Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the @code{DBI}/@code{DBD}
client interface. The interface requires Perl Version 5.6.0 or later.
It @strong{will not work} if you have an older version of Perl.

If you want to use transactions with Perl DBI, you need to have
@code{DBD::mysql} version 1.2216 or newer. Version 2.9003 or newer
is recommended.

Note that if you are using MySQL 4.1 client library, you must use
@code{2.9003} or newer.

As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is no longer included with
MySQL distributions. You can obtain the necessary modules from
@uref{http://search.cpan.org} for Unix, or using the ActiveState @code{ppm}
program on Windows. The following sections describe how to do this.

Perl support for MySQL must be installed if you want to run the MySQL
benchmark scripts.
@xref{MySQL Benchmarks}.

@subsection Installing Perl on Unix

MySQL Perl support requires that you've installed MySQL client programming
support (libraries and header files).  Most installation methods install
the necesssary files. However, if you installed MySQL from RPM files
on Linux, be sure that you've installed the developer RPM.  The client
programs are in the client RPM, but client programming support is in
the developer RPM.

If you want to install Perl support, the files you will need can
be obtained from the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) at
@uref{http://search.cpan.org}.

The easiest way to install Perl modules on Unix is to use the @code{CPAN}
module. For example:

@example
shell> perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install DBI
cpan> install DBD::mysql
@end example

The @code{DBD::mysql} installation runs a number of tests.
These tests require being able to connect to the local MySQL server
as the anonymous user with no password. If you have removed anonymous
accounts or assigned them passwords, the tests fail. You can use @code{force
install DBD::mysql} to ignore the failed tests.

@code{DBI} requires the @code{Data::Dumper} module. It may already be
installed; if not, you should install it before installing @code{DBI}.

It is also possible to download the module distributions in the form of
compressed @code{tar} archives and build the modules manually. For example,
to unpack and build a DBI distribution, use a procedure such as this:

@enumerate
@item
Unpack the distribution into the current directory:
@example
shell> gunzip < DBI-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
@end example
This command creates a directory named @file{DBI-VERSION}.

@item
Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:
@example
shell> cd DBI-VERSION
@end example

@item
Build the distribution and compile everything:
@example
shell> perl Makefile.PL
shell> make
shell> make test
shell> make install
@end example
@end enumerate

The @code{make test} command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
@code{DBD::mysql} installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the @code{DBD::mysql}
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as that all your @code{DBI} scripts
fail after you upgrade MySQL.

If you don't have access rights to install Perl modules in the system directory
or if you want to install local Perl modules, the following reference may be
useful:

@example
@uref{http://servers.digitaldaze.com/extensions/perl/modules.html#modules}
@end example

Look under the heading
@code{Installing New Modules that Require Locally Installed Modules}.

@subsection Installing ActiveState Perl on Windows

@cindex Perl, installing on Windows
@cindex ActiveState Perl

On Windows, you should do the following to install the MySQL
@code{DBD} module with ActiveState Perl:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Get ActiveState Perl from
@uref{http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/}
and install it.

@item
Open a console window (a ``DOS window'').

@item
If required, set the @code{HTTP_proxy} variable. For example, you might try:

@example
set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128
@end example

@item
Start the PPM program:

@example
C:\> c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl
@end example

@item
If you have not already done so, install @code{DBI}:

@example
ppm> install DBI
@end example

@item
If this succeeds, run the following command:

@example
install \
ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd
@end example
@end itemize

This procedure should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

If you can't get the procedure to work, you should instead install the
@code{MyODBC} driver and connect to the MySQL server through
ODBC:

@example
use DBI;
$dbh= DBI->connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn",$user,$password) ||
  die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";

@subsection Problems Using the Perl @code{DBI}/@code{DBD} Interface

@cindex problems, installing Perl
@cindex Perl DBI/DBD, installation problems

If Perl reports that it can't find the @file{../mysql/mysql.so} module,
then the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
@file{libmysqlclient.so}.

You should be able to fix this by one of the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Compile the @code{DBD::mysql} distribution with @code{perl
Makefile.PL -static -config} rather than @code{perl Makefile.PL}.

@item
Copy @file{libmysqlclient.so} to the directory where your other shared
libraries are located (probably @file{/usr/lib} or @file{/lib}).

@item
Modify the @code{-L} options used to compile @code{DBD::mysql} to reflect
the actual location of @file{libmysqlclient.so}.

@item
On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
@file{libmysqlclient.so} is located to the @file{/etc/ld.so.conf} file.

@tindex LD_RUN_PATH environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, LD_RUN_PATH
@tindex LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@item
Add the pathname of the directory where @file{libmysqlclient.so} is located
to the @code{LD_RUN_PATH} environment variable. Some systems use
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} instead.
@end itemize

Note that you may also need to modify the @code{-L} options if there are
other libraries that the linker fails to find. For example, if the linker
cannot find @code{libc} because it is in @file{/lib} and the link command
specifies @code{-L/usr/lib}, change the @code{-L} option to @code{-L/lib}
or add @code{-L/lib} to the existing link command.

If you get the following errors from @code{DBD::mysql},
you are probably using @code{gcc} (or using an old binary compiled with
@code{gcc}):

@example
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'
@end example

Add @code{-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc} to the link command when the
@file{mysql.so} library gets built (check the output from @code{make} for
@file{mysql.so} when you compile the Perl client).  The @code{-L} option
should specify the pathname of the directory where @file{libgcc.a} is located
on your system.

Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with @code{gcc}.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with @code{gcc}.

You may see the following error from @code{DBD::mysql}
when you run the tests:

@example
t/00base............install_driver(mysql) failed:
Can't load '../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so' for module DBD::mysql:
../blib/arch/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so: undefined symbol:
uncompress at /usr/lib/perl5/5.00503/i586-linux/DynaLoader.pm line 169.
@end example

This means that you need to include the @code{-lz} compression library on the
link line. That can be done by changing the following line in the file
@file{lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm}:

@example
$sysliblist .= " -lm";
@end example

Change that line to:

@example
$sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";
@end example

After this, you @strong{must} run @code{make realclean} and then
proceed with the installation from the beginning.

If you want to install DBI on SCO, you have to edit the
@file{Makefile} in DBI-xxx and each subdirectory.

Note that the following assumes @code{gcc} 2.95.2 or newer:

@example
OLD:                                  NEW:
CC = cc                               CC = gcc
CCCDLFLAGS = -KPIC -W1,-Bexport       CCCDLFLAGS = -fpic
CCDLFLAGS = -wl,-Bexport              CCDLFLAGS =

LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
LDDLFLAGS = -G -L/usr/local/lib       LDDLFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib
LDFLAGS = -belf -L/usr/local/lib      LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib

LD = ld                               LD = gcc -G -fpic
OPTIMISE = -Od                        OPTIMISE = -O1

OLD:
CCCFLAGS = -belf -dy -w0 -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include

NEW:
CCFLAGS = -U M_XENIX -DPERL_SCO5 -I/usr/local/include
@end example

This is because the Perl dynaloader will not load the @code{DBI} modules
if they were compiled with @code{icc} or @code{cc}.

If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like SCO) you can generate a static version of
Perl that includes @code{DBI} and @code{DBD::mysql}.  The way this works
is that you generate a version of Perl with the @code{DBI} code linked
in and install it on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to
build a version of Perl that additionally has the @code{DBD} code linked
in, and install that.

On SCO, you must have the following environment variables set:

@example
shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
Or:
shell> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell> LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell> MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:\
/usr/skunk/man:
@end example

First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked @code{DBI} module by
running these commands in the directory where your @code{DBI} distribution is
located:

@example
shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell> make
shell> make install
shell> make perl
@end example

Then you must install the new Perl. The output of @code{make perl} will
indicate the exact @code{make} command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On SCO, this is
@code{make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl}.

Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also includes a
statically linked @code{DBD::mysql} by running these commands in the
directory where your @code{DBD::mysql} distribution is located:

@example
shell> perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell> make
shell> make install
shell> make perl
@end example

Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of @code{make
perl} indicates the command to use.

This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing
how to use the @code{mysql} client program to create and use a simple
database.  @code{mysql} (sometimes referred to as the ``terminal monitor'' or
just ``monitor'') is an interactive program that allows you to connect to a
MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.  @code{mysql} may
also be used in batch mode: you place your queries in a file beforehand, then
tell @code{mysql} to execute the contents of the file.  Both ways of using
@code{mysql} are covered here.

To see a list of options provided by @code{mysql}, invoke it with
the @code{--help} option:

@example
shell> mysql --help
@end example

This chapter assumes that @code{mysql} is installed on your machine and that
a MySQL server is available to which you can connect.  If this is
not true, contact your MySQL administrator.  (If @strong{you} are the
administrator, you will need to consult other sections of this manual.)

This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database.  If you are interested only in accessing an already-existing
database, you may want to skip over the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are necessarily
omitted.  Consult the relevant sections of the manual for more
information on the topics covered here.

@section Connecting to and Disconnecting from the Server

@cindex connecting, to the server
@cindex disconnecting, from the server
@cindex server, connecting
@cindex server, disconnecting

To connect to the server, you'll usually need to provide a MySQL
username when you invoke @code{mysql} and, most likely, a password.  If the
server runs on a machine other than the one where you log in, you'll also
need to specify a hostname.  Contact your administrator to find out what
connection parameters you should use to connect (that is, what host, username,
and password to use).  Once you know the proper parameters, you should be
able to connect like this:

@example
shell> mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
@end example

@code{host} and @code{user} represent the hostname where your MySQL server is
running and the username of your MySQL account.  Substitute appropriate values
for your setup.
The @code{********} represents your password; enter it when @code{mysql}
displays the @code{Enter password:} prompt.

If that works, you should see some introductory information followed by a
@code{mysql>} prompt:


@example
shell> mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 25338 to server version: 4.0.14-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>
@end example

The prompt tells you that @code{mysql} is ready for you to enter commands.

Some MySQL installations allow users to connect as the anonymous
(unnamed) user to the server running on the local host.  If this is the case
on your machine, you should be able to connect to that server by invoking
@code{mysql} without any options:

@example
shell> mysql
@end example

After you have connected successfully, you can disconnect any time by typing
@code{QUIT} (or @code{\q}) at the @code{mysql>} prompt:

@example
mysql> QUIT
Bye
@end example

On Unix, you can also disconnect by pressing Control-D.

Most examples in the following sections assume that you are connected to the
server.  They indicate this by the @code{mysql>} prompt.


@node Entering queries, Database use, Connecting-disconnecting, Tutorial
@section Entering Queries

@cindex running, queries
@cindex queries, entering
@cindex entering, queries

Make sure that you are connected to the server, as discussed in the previous
section.  Doing so will not in itself select any database to work with, but
that's okay.  At this point, it's more important to find out a little about
how to issue queries than to jump right in creating tables, loading data
into them, and retrieving data from them.  This section describes the basic
principles of entering commands, using several queries you can try out to
familiarize yourself with how @code{mysql} works.

Here's a simple command that asks the server to tell you its version number
and the current date.  Type it in as shown here following the @code{mysql>}
prompt and press Enter:

@example
mysql> SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------+--------------+
| VERSION()    | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log | 1999-03-19   |
+--------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql>
@end example

This query illustrates several things about @code{mysql}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A command normally consists of an SQL statement followed by a semicolon.
(There are some exceptions where a semicolon may be omitted.  @code{QUIT},
mentioned earlier, is one of them.  We'll get to others later.)

@item
When you issue a command, @code{mysql} sends it to the server for execution
and displays the results, then prints another @code{mysql>} prompt to indicate
that it is ready for another command.

@item
@code{mysql} displays query output in tabular form (rows and columns).  The
first row contains labels for the columns.  The rows following are the query
results.  Normally, column labels are the names of the columns you fetch from
database tables.  If you're retrieving the value of an expression rather than
a table column (as in the example just shown), @code{mysql} labels the column
using the expression itself.

@item
@code{mysql} shows how many rows were returned and how long the query took
to execute, which gives you a rough idea of server performance.  These values
are imprecise because they represent wall clock time (not CPU or machine
time), and because they are affected by factors such as server load and
network latency.  (For brevity, the ``rows in set'' line is not shown in
the remaining examples in this chapter.)
@end itemize

Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.  The following queries are
equivalent:

@example
mysql> SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
mysql> select version(), current_date;
mysql> SeLeCt vErSiOn(), current_DATE;
@end example

Here's another query.  It demonstrates that you can use @code{mysql} as a
simple calculator:

@example
mysql> SELECT SIN(PI()/4), (4+1)*5;
+-------------+---------+
| SIN(PI()/4) | (4+1)*5 |
+-------------+---------+
|    0.707107 |      25 |
+-------------+---------+
@end example

The queries shown thus far have been relatively short, single-line
statements.  You can even enter multiple statements on a single line.
Just end each one with a semicolon:

@example
mysql> SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();
+--------------+
| VERSION()    |
+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log |
+--------------+

+---------------------+
| NOW()               |
+---------------------+
| 1999-03-19 00:15:33 |
+---------------------+
@end example

A command need not be given all on a single line, so lengthy commands that
require several lines are not a problem.  @code{mysql} determines where your
statement ends by looking for the terminating semicolon, not by looking for
the end of the input line.  (In other words, @code{mysql}
accepts free-format input:  it collects input lines but does not execute them
until it sees the semicolon.)

Here's a simple multiple-line statement:

@example
mysql> SELECT
    -> USER()
    -> ,
    -> CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------------+--------------+
| USER()             | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------------+--------------+
| joesmith@@localhost | 1999-03-18   |
+--------------------+--------------+
@end example

In this example, notice how the prompt changes from @code{mysql>} to
@code{->} after you enter the first line of a multiple-line query.  This is
how @code{mysql} indicates that it hasn't seen a complete statement and is
waiting for the rest.  The prompt is your friend, because it provides
valuable feedback.  If you use that feedback, you will always be aware of
what @code{mysql} is waiting for.

If you decide you don't want to execute a command that you are in the
process of entering, cancel it by typing @code{\c}:

@example
mysql> SELECT
    -> USER()
    -> \c
mysql>
@end example

Here, too, notice the prompt.  It switches back to @code{mysql>} after you
type @code{\c}, providing feedback to indicate that @code{mysql} is ready
for a new command.

The following table shows each of the prompts you may see and summarizes what
they mean about the state that @code{mysql} is in:

@cindex prompts, meanings
@multitable @columnfractions .10 .80
@item @strong{Prompt} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{mysql>} @tab Ready for new command.
@item @code{@ @ @ @ ->} @tab Waiting for next line of multiple-line command.
@item @code{@ @ @ @ '>} @tab Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a single quote (@samp{'}).
@item @code{@ @ @ @ ">} @tab Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins with a double quote (@samp{"}).
@item @code{@ @ @ @ `>} @tab Waiting for next line, collecting an identifier that begins with a backtick (@samp{`}).
@end multitable

Multiple-line statements commonly occur by accident when you intend to
issue a command on a single line, but forget the terminating semicolon.  In
this case, @code{mysql} waits for more input:

@example
mysql> SELECT USER()
    ->
@end example

If this happens to you (you think you've entered a statement but the only
response is a @code{->} prompt), most likely @code{mysql} is waiting for the
semicolon.  If you don't notice what the prompt is telling you, you might sit
there for a while before realising what you need to do.  Enter a semicolon to
complete the statement, and @code{mysql} will execute it:

@example
mysql> SELECT USER()
    -> ;
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| joesmith@@localhost |
+--------------------+
@end example

The @code{'>} and @code{">} prompts occur during string collection.
In MySQL, you can write strings surrounded by either @samp{'}
or @samp{"} characters (for example, @code{'hello'} or @code{"goodbye"}),
and @code{mysql} lets you enter strings that span multiple lines.  When you
see a @code{'>} or @code{">} prompt, it means that you've entered a line
containing a string that begins with a @samp{'} or @samp{"} quote character,
but have not yet entered the matching quote that terminates the string.
That's fine if you really are entering a multiple-line string, but how likely
is that?  Not very.  More often, the @code{'>} and @code{">} prompts indicate
that you've inadvertantly left out a quote character.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = 'Smith AND age < 30;
    '>
@end example

If you enter this @code{SELECT} statement, then press Enter and wait for the
result, nothing will happen.  Instead of wondering why this
query takes so long, notice the clue provided by the @code{'>} prompt.  It
tells you that @code{mysql} expects to see the rest of an unterminated
string.  (Do you see the error in the statement?  The string @code{'Smith} is
missing the second quote.)

At this point, what do you do?  The simplest thing is to cancel the command.
However, you cannot just type @code{\c} in this case, because @code{mysql}
interprets it as part of the string that it is collecting!  Instead, enter
the closing quote character (so @code{mysql} knows you've finished the
string), then type @code{\c}:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = 'Smith AND age < 30;
    '> '\c
mysql>
@end example

The prompt changes back to @code{mysql>}, indicating that @code{mysql}
is ready for a new command.

The @code{`>} prompt is similar to th @code{'>} and @code{">} prompts,
but indicates that you have begun but not completed a backtick-quoted
identifier.

It's important to know what the @code{'>}, @code{">}, and @code{`>} prompts signify,
because if you mistakenly enter an unterminated string, any further lines you
type will appear to be ignored by @code{mysql}---including a line
containing @code{QUIT}!  This can be quite confusing, especially if you
don't know that you need to supply the terminating quote before you can
cancel the current command.

Now that you know how to enter commands, it's time to access a database.

Suppose that you have several pets in your home (your menagerie) and you'd
like to keep track of various types of information about them.  You can do so
by creating tables to hold your data and loading them with the desired
information.  Then you can answer different sorts of questions about your
animals by retrieving data from the tables.  This section shows you how to:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Create a database
@item
Create a table
@item
Load data into the table
@item
Retrieve data from the table in various ways
@item
Use multiple tables
@end itemize

The menagerie database will be simple (deliberately), but it is not difficult
to think of real-world situations in which a similar type of database might
be used.  For example, a database like this could be used by a farmer to keep
track of livestock, or by a veterinarian to keep track of patient records.
A menagerie distribution containing some of the queries and sample data used
in the following sections can be obtained from the MySQL Web site.
It's available in either compressed @code{tar} format
(@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz})
or Zip format
(@uref{http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip}).

Use the @code{SHOW} statement to find out what databases currently exist
on the server:

@example
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| mysql    |
| test     |
| tmp      |
+----------+
@end example

The list of databases is probably different on your machine, but the
@code{mysql} and @code{test} databases are likely to be among them.  The
@code{mysql} database is required because it describes user access
privileges.  The @code{test} database is often provided as a workspace for
users to try things out.

Note that you may not see all databases if you don't have the
@code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege. @xref{GRANT, , @code{GRANT}}.

If the @code{test} database exists, try to access it:

@example
mysql> USE test
Database changed
@end example

Note that @code{USE}, like @code{QUIT}, does not require a semicolon.  (You
can terminate such statements with a semicolon if you like; it does no harm.)
The @code{USE} statement is special in another way, too:  it must be given on
a single line.

You can use the @code{test} database (if you have access to it) for the
examples that follow, but anything you create in that database can be
removed by anyone else with access to it.  For this reason, you should
probably ask your MySQL administrator for permission to use a
database of your own.  Suppose that you want to call yours @code{menagerie}.  The
administrator needs to execute a command like this:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO 'your_mysql_name'@@'your_client_host';
@end example

where @code{your_mysql_name} is the MySQL username assigned to
you and @code{your_client_host} is the host from which you connect to the
server.

@subsection Creating and Selecting a Database

@cindex selecting, databases
@cindex databases, selecting

If the administrator creates your database for you when setting up your
permissions, you can begin using it.  Otherwise, you need to create it
yourself:

@example
mysql> CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
@end example

Under Unix, database names are case-sensitive (unlike SQL keywords), so you
must always refer to your database as @code{menagerie}, not as
@code{Menagerie}, @code{MENAGERIE}, or some other variant.  This is also true
for table names.  (Under Windows, this restriction does not apply, although
you must refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase throughout a
given query.)

Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly.
To make @code{menagerie} the current database, use this command:

@example
mysql> USE menagerie
Database changed
@end example

Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for use
each time you begin a @code{mysql} session.  You can do this by issuing a
@code{USE} statement as shown in the example.  Alternatively, you can select the
database on the command line when you invoke @code{mysql}.  Just specify its
name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide.  For
example:

@example
shell> mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
Enter password: ********
@end example

Note that @code{menagerie} is not your password on the command just shown.
If you want to supply your password on the command line after the @code{-p}
option, you must do so with no intervening space (for example, as
@code{-pmypassword}, not as @code{-p mypassword}).  However, putting your
password on the command line is not recommended, because doing so exposes it
to snooping by other users logged in on your machine.


@node Creating tables, Loading tables, Creating database, Database use
@subsection Creating a Table

@cindex tables, creating
@cindex creating, tables

Creating the database is the easy part, but at this point it's empty, as
@code{SHOW TABLES} will tell you:

@example
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
@end example

The harder part is deciding what the structure of your database should be:
what tables you will need and what columns will be in each of them.

You'll want a table that contains a record for each of your pets.  This can
be called the @code{pet} table, and it should contain, as a bare minimum,
each animal's name.  Because the name by itself is not very interesting, the
table should contain other information.  For example, if more than one person
in your family keeps pets, you might want to list each animal's owner.  You
might also want to record some basic descriptive information such as species
and sex.

How about age?  That might be of interest, but it's not a good thing to store
in a database.  Age changes as time passes, which means you'd have to update
your records often.  Instead, it's better to store a fixed value such as
date of birth.  Then, whenever you need age, you can calculate it as the
difference between the current date and the birth date.  MySQL
provides functions for doing date arithmetic, so this is not difficult.
Storing birth date rather than age has other advantages, too:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can use the database for tasks such as generating reminders for upcoming
pet birthdays.  (If you think this type of query is somewhat silly, note that
it is the same question you might ask in the context of a business database
to identify clients to whom you'll soon need to send out birthday greetings,
for that computer-assisted personal touch.)

@item
You can calculate age in relation to dates other than the current date.  For
example, if you store death date in the database, you can easily calculate
how old a pet was when it died.
@end itemize

You can probably think of other types of information that would be useful in
the @code{pet} table, but the ones identified so far are sufficient for now:
name, owner, species, sex, birth, and death.

Use a @code{CREATE TABLE} statement to specify the layout of your table:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
    -> species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
@end example

@code{VARCHAR} is a good choice for the @code{name}, @code{owner}, and
@code{species} columns because the column values will vary in length.  The
lengths of those columns need not all be the same, and need not be
@code{20}.  You can pick any length from @code{1} to @code{255}, whatever
seems most reasonable to you.  (If you make a poor choice and it turns
out later that you need a longer field, MySQL provides an
@code{ALTER TABLE} statement.)

Several types of values can be chosen to represent sex in animal records,
such as @code{'m'}
and @code{'f'}, or perhaps @code{'male'} and @code{'female'}.  It's simplest
to use the single characters @code{'m'} and @code{'f'}.

The use of the @code{DATE} data type for the @code{birth} and @code{death}
columns is a fairly obvious choice.

Now that you have created a table, @code{SHOW TABLES} should produce some
output:

@example
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
@end example

To verify that your table was created the way you expected, use
a @code{DESCRIBE} statement:

@example
mysql> DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
@end example

You can use @code{DESCRIBE} any time, for example, if you forget the names of
the columns in your table or what types they have.


@node Loading tables, Retrieving data, Creating tables, Database use
@subsection Loading Data into a Table

@cindex loading, tables
@cindex tables, loading data
@cindex data, loading into tables

After creating your table, you need to populate it.  The @code{LOAD DATA} and
@code{INSERT} statements are useful for this.

Suppose that your pet records can be described as shown here.
(Observe that MySQL expects dates in @code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} format;
this may be different from what you are used to.)

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .10 .10 .05 .20 .20
@item @strong{name} @tab @strong{owner} @tab @strong{species} @tab @strong{sex} @tab @strong{birth} @tab @strong{death}
@item Fluffy @tab Harold @tab cat @tab f @tab 1993-02-04 @tab
@item Claws @tab Gwen @tab cat @tab m @tab 1994-03-17 @tab
@item Buffy @tab Harold @tab dog @tab f @tab 1989-05-13 @tab
@item Fang @tab Benny @tab dog @tab m @tab 1990-08-27 @tab
@item Bowser @tab Diane @tab dog @tab m @tab 1979-08-31 @tab 1995-07-29
@item Chirpy @tab Gwen @tab bird @tab f @tab 1998-09-11 @tab
@item Whistler @tab Gwen @tab bird @tab @tab 1997-12-09 @tab
@item Slim @tab Benny @tab snake @tab m @tab 1996-04-29 @tab
@end multitable

Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate it is to
create a text file containing a row for each of your animals, then load the
contents of the file into the table with a single statement.

You could create a text file @file{pet.txt} containing one record per line,
with values separated by tabs, and given in the order in which the columns
were listed in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.  For missing values (such
as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still living), you can
use @code{NULL} values.  To represent these in your text file, use
@code{\N} (backslash, capital-N).  For example, the record for Whistler the
bird would look like
this (where the whitespace between values is a single tab character):

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .10 .10 .05 .20 .20
@item @strong{name} @tab @strong{owner} @tab @strong{species} @tab @strong{sex} @tab @strong{birth} @tab @strong{death}
@item @code{Whistler} @tab @code{Gwen} @tab @code{bird} @tab @code{\N} @tab @code{1997-12-09} @tab @code{\N}
@end multitable

To load the text file @file{pet.txt} into the @code{pet} table, use this
command:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;
@end example

Note that if you created the file on Windows with an editor that uses
@code{\r\n} as a line terminator, you should use:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet
    -> LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
@end example

You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker explicitly
in the @code{LOAD DATA} statement if you wish, but the defaults are tab and
linefeed.  These are sufficient for the statement to read the file
@file{pet.txt} properly.

If the statement fails, it is likely that your MySQL installation does not
have local file capability enabled by default.  See
@ref{LOAD DATA LOCAL, , @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}} for information on how to
change this.

When you want to add new records one at a time, the @code{INSERT} statement
is useful.  In its simplest form, you supply values for each column, in the
order in which the columns were listed in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.
Suppose that Diane gets a new hamster named Puffball.  You could add a new record
using an @code{INSERT} statement like this:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO pet
    -> VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
@end example

Note that string and date values are specified as quoted strings here.  Also,
with @code{INSERT}, you can insert @code{NULL} directly to represent a
missing value.  You do not use @code{\N} like you do with @code{LOAD DATA}.

From this example, you should be able to see that there would be a lot more
typing involved to load
your records initially using several @code{INSERT} statements rather
than a single @code{LOAD DATA} statement.

The @code{SELECT} statement is used to pull information from a table.
The general form of the statement is:

@example
SELECT what_to_select
FROM which_table
WHERE conditions_to_satisfy;
@end example

@code{what_to_select} indicates what you want to see.  This can be a list of
columns, or @code{*} to indicate ``all columns.'' @code{which_table}
indicates the table from which you want to retrieve data.  The @code{WHERE}
clause is optional.  If it's present, @code{conditions_to_satisfy} specifies
conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for retrieval.


@node Selecting all, Selecting rows, Retrieving data, Retrieving data
@subsubsection Selecting All Data

The simplest form of @code{SELECT} retrieves everything from a table:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet;
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1979-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
| Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
| Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
| Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

This form of @code{SELECT} is useful if you want to review your entire table,
for example, after you've just loaded it with your initial dataset.  For
example, you may happen to think that the birth date for Bowser doesn't seem
quite right.  Consulting your original pedigree
papers, you find that the correct birth year should be 1989, not 1979.

There are least a couple of ways to fix this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Edit the file @file{pet.txt} to correct the error, then empty the table
and reload it using @code{DELETE} and @code{LOAD DATA}:

@example
@c I cannot determine what purpose messing with AUTOCOMMIT has in a simple
@c tutorial example like this; I've commented it out -- pd
@c mysql> SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;  # Used for quick re-create of the table
mysql> DELETE FROM pet;
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;
@end example

However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record for Puffball.

@item
Fix only the erroneous record with an @code{UPDATE} statement:

@example
mysql> UPDATE pet SET birth = '1989-08-31' WHERE name = 'Bowser';
@end example

The @code{UPDATE} changes only the record in question and does not require you
to reload the table.
@end itemize


@node Selecting rows, Selecting columns, Selecting all, Retrieving data
@subsubsection Selecting Particular Rows

@cindex rows, selecting
@cindex tables, selecting rows

As shown in the preceding section, it is easy to retrieve an entire table.
Just omit the @code{WHERE} clause from the @code{SELECT} statement.
But typically you don't want
to see the entire table, particularly when it becomes large.  Instead,
you're usually more interested in answering a particular question, in which
case you specify some constraints on the information you want.  Let's look at
some selection queries in terms of questions about your pets that they
answer.

You can select only particular rows from your table.  For example, if you want
to verify the change that you made to Bowser's birth date, select Bowser's
record like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = 'Bowser';
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Bowser | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

The output confirms that the year is correctly recorded now as 1989, not 1979.

String comparisons normally are case-insensitive, so you can specify the
name as @code{'bowser'}, @code{'BOWSER'}, etc.  The query result will be
the same.

You can specify conditions on any column, not just @code{name}.  For example,
if you want to know which animals were born after 1998, test the @code{birth}
column:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth >= '1998-1-1';
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Puffball | Diane | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

You can combine conditions, for example, to locate female dogs:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f';
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

The preceding query uses the @code{AND} logical operator.  There is also an
@code{OR} operator:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'snake' OR species = 'bird';
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL  |
| Slim     | Benny | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

@code{AND} and @code{OR} may be intermixed, though @code{AND} has higher
precedence than @code{OR}.  If you use both operators, it's a good idea
to use parentheses to indicate explicitly how conditions should be grouped:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = 'cat' AND sex = 'm')
    -> OR (species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f');
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

@subsubsection Selecting Particular Columns

@cindex columns, selecting
@cindex tables, selecting columns

If you don't want to see entire rows from your table, just name the columns
in which you're interested, separated by commas.  For example, if you want to
know when your animals were born, select the @code{name} and @code{birth}
columns:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |
+----------+------------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
+----------+------------+
@end example

To find out who owns pets, use this query:

@example
mysql> SELECT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |
+--------+
| Harold |
| Gwen   |
| Harold |
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
| Gwen   |
| Gwen   |
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
+--------+
@end example

@findex DISTINCT
However, notice that the query simply retrieves the @code{owner} field from
each record, and some of them appear more than once.  To minimize the output,
retrieve each unique output record just once by adding the keyword
@code{DISTINCT}:

@example
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |
+--------+
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
| Gwen   |
| Harold |
+--------+
@end example

You can use a @code{WHERE} clause to combine row selection with column
selection.  For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only,
use this query:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
    -> WHERE species = 'dog' OR species = 'cat';
+--------+---------+------------+
| name   | species | birth      |
+--------+---------+------------+
| Fluffy | cat     | 1993-02-04 |
| Claws  | cat     | 1994-03-17 |
| Buffy  | dog     | 1989-05-13 |
| Fang   | dog     | 1990-08-27 |
| Bowser | dog     | 1989-08-31 |
+--------+---------+------------+
@end example

@subsubsection Sorting Rows

@cindex sorting, data
@cindex tables, sorting rows

You may have noticed in the preceding examples that the result rows are
displayed in no particular order.  It's often easier to examine
query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way.  To sort a
result, use an @code{ORDER BY} clause.

Here are animal birthdays, sorted by date:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |
+----------+------------+
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
+----------+------------+
@end example

On character type columns, sorting---like all other comparison
operations---is normally performed in a case-insensitive fashion.
This means that the order will be undefined for columns that are identical
except for their case. You can force a case-sensitive sort for a column
by using the @code{BINARY} cast: @code{ORDER BY BINARY col_name}.

The default sort order is ascending, with smallest values first.
To sort in reverse (descending) order, add the @code{DESC} keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |
+----------+------------+
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
+----------+------------+
@end example

You can sort on multiple columns, and you can sort columns in different
directions.  For example, to sort by type of
animal in ascending order, then by birth date within animal type in descending
order (youngest animals first), use the following query:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet
    -> ORDER BY species, birth DESC;
+----------+---------+------------+

@subsubsection Date Calculations

@cindex date calculations
@cindex calculating, dates
@cindex extracting, dates
@cindex age, calculating

MySQL provides several functions that you can use to perform
calculations on dates, for example, to calculate ages or extract
parts of dates.

To determine how many years old each of your pets is, compute the
difference in the year part of the current date and the birth date, then
subtract one if the current date occurs earlier in the calendar year than
the birth date.  The following query shows, for each pet, the birth date,
the current date, and the age in years.

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),
    -> (YEAR(CURDATE())-YEAR(birth))
    -> - (RIGHT(CURDATE(),5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
    -> AS age
    -> FROM pet;
+----------+------------+------------+------+
| name     | birth      | CURDATE()  | age  |
+----------+------------+------------+------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 | 2003-08-19 |   10 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 | 2003-08-19 |    9 |

| Puffball | 1999-03-30 | 2003-08-19 |    4 |
+----------+------------+------------+------+
@end example

Here, @code{YEAR()} pulls out the year part of a date and @code{RIGHT()}
pulls off the rightmost five characters that represent the @code{MM-DD}
(calendar year) part of the date.  The part of the expression that
compares the @code{MM-DD} values evaluates to 1 or 0, which adjusts the
year difference down a year if @code{CURDATE()} occurs earlier in
the year than @code{birth}.  The full expression is somewhat ungainly,
so an alias (@code{age}) is used to make the output column label more
meaningful.

The query works, but the result could be scanned more easily if the rows
were presented in some order.  This can be done by adding an @code{ORDER
BY name} clause to sort the output by name:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth, CURDATE(),
    -> (YEAR(CURDATE())-YEAR(birth))
    -> - (RIGHT(CURDATE(),5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
    -> AS age
    -> FROM pet ORDER BY name;

    -> - (RIGHT(CURDATE(),5)<RIGHT(birth,5))

+----------+------------+------------+------+
@end example

A similar query can be used to determine age at death for animals that have
died.  You determine which animals these are by checking whether the
@code{death} value is @code{NULL}.  Then, for those with non-@code{NULL}
values, compute the difference between the @code{death} and @code{birth}
values:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth, death,
    -> (YEAR(death)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(death,5)<RIGHT(birth,5))
    -> AS age
    -> FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| name   | birth      | death      | age  |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| Bowser | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |    5 |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
@end example

The query uses @code{death IS NOT NULL} rather than @code{death <> NULL}
because @code{NULL} is a special value that cannot be compared using the usual
comparison operators.  This is discussed later.
@xref{Working with NULL,  , Working with @code{NULL}}.

What if you want to know which animals have birthdays next month?  For this
type of calculation, year and day are irrelevant; you simply want to extract
the month part of the @code{birth} column.  MySQL provides several
date-part extraction functions, such as @code{YEAR()}, @code{MONTH()}, and
@code{DAYOFMONTH()}.  @code{MONTH()} is the appropriate function here.  To
see how it works, run a simple query that displays the value of both
@code{birth} and @code{MONTH(birth)}:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
+----------+------------+--------------+
| name     | birth      | MONTH(birth) |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |            2 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 |            3 |
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |            5 |
| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |            8 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |            8 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |            9 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |           12 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |            4 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |            3 |
+----------+------------+--------------+
@end example

Finding animals with birthdays in the upcoming month is easy, too.  Suppose
that the current month is April.  Then the month value is @code{4} and you look
for animals born in May (month @code{5}) like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
+-------+------------+
| name  | birth      |
+-------+------------+
| Buffy | 1989-05-13 |
+-------+------------+
@end example

There is a small complication if the current month is December.
You don't just add one to the month number (@code{12}) and look for animals
born in month @code{13}, because there is no such month.  Instead, you look for
animals born in January (month @code{1}).

You can even write the query so that it works no matter what the current
month is.  That way you don't have to use a particular month number
in the query.  @code{DATE_ADD()} allows you to add a time interval to a
given date.  If you add a month to the value of @code{CURDATE()}, then extract
the month part with @code{MONTH()}, the result produces the month in which to
look for birthdays:

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -> WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
@end example

A different way to accomplish the same task is to add @code{1} to get the
next month after the current one (after using the modulo function (@code{MOD})
to wrap around the month value to @code{0} if it is currently
@code{12}):

@example
mysql> SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -> WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(CURDATE()), 12) + 1;
@end example

Note that @code{MONTH} returns a number between @code{1} and @code{12}. And
@code{MOD(something,12)} returns a number between @code{0} and @code{11}. So the
addition has to be after the @code{MOD()}, otherwise we would go from
November (@code{11}) to January (@code{1}).

@subsubsection Working with @code{NULL} Values

@findex NULL
@cindex NULL value

The @code{NULL} value can be surprising until you get used to it.
Conceptually, @code{NULL} means missing value or unknown value and it
is treated somewhat differently than other values.  To test for @code{NULL},
you cannot use the arithmetic comparison operators such as @code{=}, @code{<},
or @code{<>}.  To demonstrate this for yourself, try the following query:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 <> NULL, 1 < NULL, 1 > NULL;
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
| 1 = NULL | 1 <> NULL | 1 < NULL | 1 > NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
|     NULL |      NULL |     NULL |     NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
@end example

Clearly you get no meaningful results from these comparisons.  Use
the @code{IS NULL} and @code{IS NOT NULL} operators instead:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
+-----------+---------------+
| 1 IS NULL | 1 IS NOT NULL |
+-----------+---------------+
|         0 |             1 |
+-----------+---------------+
@end example

Note that in MySQL, @code{0} or @code{NULL} means false and anything else means
true. The default truth value from a boolean operation is @code{1}.

This special treatment of @code{NULL} is why, in the previous section, it
was necessary to determine which animals are no longer alive using
@code{death IS NOT NULL} instead of @code{death <> NULL}.

Two @code{NULL} values are regarded as equal in a @code{GROUP BY}.

When doing an @code{ORDER BY}, @code{NULL} values are presented first if you
do @code{ORDER BY ... ASC} and last if you do @code{ORDER BY ... DESC}.

Note that MySQL 4.0.2 to 4.0.10 incorrectly always sorts @code{NULL} values
first regardless of the sort direction.


@node Pattern matching, Counting rows, Working with NULL, Retrieving data
@subsubsection Pattern Matching

@cindex pattern matching
@cindex matching, patterns
@cindex expressions, extended

MySQL provides standard SQL pattern matching as well as a form of
pattern matching based on extended regular expressions similar to those used
by Unix utilities such as @code{vi}, @code{grep}, and @code{sed}.

SQL pattern matching allows you to use @samp{_} to match any single
character and @samp{%} to match an arbitrary number of characters (including
zero characters).  In MySQL, SQL patterns are case-insensitive by
default.  Some examples are shown here.  Note that you do not use @code{=}
or @code{<>} when you use SQL patterns; use the @code{LIKE} or @code{NOT
LIKE} comparison operators instead.

To find names beginning with @samp{b}:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE 'b%';
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

To find names ending with @samp{fy}:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%fy';
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

To find names containing a @samp{w}:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '%w%';
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

To find names containing exactly five characters, use five instances of
the @samp{_} pattern character:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name LIKE '_____';
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

The other type of pattern matching provided by MySQL uses extended
regular expressions.  When you test for a match for this type of pattern, use
the @code{REGEXP} and @code{NOT REGEXP} operators (or @code{RLIKE} and
@code{NOT RLIKE}, which are synonyms).

Some characteristics of extended regular expressions are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{.} matches any single character.

@item
A character class @samp{[...]} matches any character within the brackets.
For example, @samp{[abc]} matches @samp{a}, @samp{b}, or @samp{c}.  To name a
range of characters, use a dash.  @samp{[a-z]} matches any letter,
whereas @samp{[0-9]} matches any digit.

@item
@samp{*} matches zero or more instances of the thing preceding it.  For
example, @samp{x*} matches any number of @samp{x} characters,
@samp{[0-9]*} matches any number of digits, and @samp{.*} matches any
number of anything.

@item
A @code{REGEXP} pattern match succeed if
the pattern matches anywhere in the value being tested.
(This differs from a @code{LIKE} pattern match, which succeeds only if the
pattern matches the entire value.)

@item
To anchor a pattern so that it must match the beginning or end of the value
being tested, use @samp{^} at the beginning or @samp{$} at the end of the
pattern.
@end itemize

To demonstrate how extended regular expressions work, the @code{LIKE} queries
shown previously are rewritten here to use @code{REGEXP}.

To find names beginning with @samp{b}, use @samp{^} to match the beginning of
the name:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^b';
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Bowser | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

Prior to MySQL Version 3.23.4, @code{REGEXP} is case-sensitive,
and the previous query will return no rows. In this case, to match either
lowercase or uppercase @samp{b}, use this query instead:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^[bB]';
@end example

From MySQL 3.23.4 on, if you really want to force a @code{REGEXP} comparison to
be case-sensitive, use the @code{BINARY} keyword to make one of the
strings a binary string. This query will match only lowercase @samp{b}
at the beginning of a name:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY '^b';
@end example

To find names ending with @samp{fy}, use @samp{$} to match the end of the
name:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP 'fy$';
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name   | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Fluffy | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL  |
| Buffy  | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

To find names containing a @samp{w}, use this query:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP 'w';
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Claws    | Gwen  | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
@end example

Because a regular expression pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the
value, it is not necessary in the previous query to put a wildcard on either
side of the pattern to get it to match the entire value like it would be if
you used an SQL pattern.

To find names containing exactly five characters, use @samp{^} and @samp{$}
to match the beginning and end of the name, and five instances of @samp{.}
in between:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^.....$';
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example

You could also write the previous query using the @samp{@{n@}}
``repeat-@code{n}-times'' operator:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP '^.@{5@}$';
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
@end example


@node Counting rows, Multiple tables, Pattern matching, Retrieving data
@subsubsection Counting Rows

@cindex rows, counting
@cindex tables, counting rows
@cindex counting, table rows

Databases are often used to answer the question, ``How often does a certain
type of data occur in a table?''  For example, you might want to know how
many pets you have, or how many pets each owner has, or you might want to
perform various kinds of census operations on your animals.

Counting the total number of animals you have is the same question as ``How
many rows are in the @code{pet} table?'' because there is one record per pet.
@code{COUNT(*)} counts the number of rows, so
the query to count your animals looks like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        9 |
+----------+
@end example

Earlier, you retrieved the names of the people who owned pets.  You can
use @code{COUNT()} if you want to find out how many pets each owner has:

@example
mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+
| Benny  |        2 |
| Diane  |        2 |
| Gwen   |        3 |
| Harold |        2 |
+--------+----------+
@end example

Note the use of @code{GROUP BY} to group together all records for each
@code{owner}.  Without it, all you get is an error message:

@example
mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140: Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
@end example

@code{COUNT()} and @code{GROUP BY} are useful for characterizing your
data in various ways.  The following examples show different ways to
perform animal census operations.

Number of animals per species:

@example
mysql> SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
+---------+----------+
| species | COUNT(*) |
+---------+----------+
| bird    |        2 |
| cat     |        2 |
| dog     |        3 |
| hamster |        1 |
| snake   |        1 |
+---------+----------+
@end example

Number of animals per sex:

@example
mysql> SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY sex;
+------+----------+
| sex  | COUNT(*) |
+------+----------+
| NULL |        1 |
| f    |        4 |
| m    |        4 |
+------+----------+
@end example

(In this output, @code{NULL} indicates that the sex is unknown.)

Number of animals per combination of species and sex:

@example
mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| bird    | NULL |        1 |
| bird    | f    |        1 |
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
| hamster | f    |        1 |
| snake   | m    |        1 |
+---------+------+----------+
@end example

You need not retrieve an entire table when you use @code{COUNT()}.  For
example, the previous query, when performed just on dogs and cats, looks like
this:

@example
mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -> WHERE species = 'dog' OR species = 'cat'
    -> GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
+---------+------+----------+
@end example

Or, if you wanted the number of animals per sex only for known-sex animals:

@example
mysql> SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -> WHERE sex IS NOT NULL
    -> GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+

@node Multiple tables,  , Counting rows, Retrieving data
@subsubsection Using More Than one Table

@cindex tables, multiple

The @code{pet} table keeps track of which pets you have.  If you want to
record other information about them, such as events in their lives like
visits to the vet or when litters are born, you need another table.  What
should this table look like? It needs:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To contain the pet name so you know which animal each event pertains
to.

@item
A date so you know when the event occurred.

@item
A field to describe the event.

@item
An event type field, if you want to be able to categorize events.
@end itemize

Given these considerations, the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement for the
@code{event} table might look like this:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE event (name VARCHAR(20), date DATE,
    -> type VARCHAR(15), remark VARCHAR(255));
@end example

As with the @code{pet} table, it's easiest to load the initial records
by creating a tab-delimited text file containing the information:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .15 .35
@item @strong{name} @tab @strong{date} @tab @strong{type} @tab @strong{remark}
@item Fluffy @tab 1995-05-15 @tab litter @tab 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male
@item Buffy @tab 1993-06-23 @tab litter @tab 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male
@item Buffy @tab 1994-06-19 @tab litter @tab 3 puppies, 3 female
@item Chirpy @tab 1999-03-21 @tab vet @tab needed beak straightened
@item Slim @tab 1997-08-03 @tab vet @tab broken rib
@item Bowser @tab 1991-10-12 @tab kennel @tab
@item Fang @tab 1991-10-12 @tab kennel @tab
@item Fang @tab 1998-08-28 @tab birthday @tab Gave him a new chew toy
@item Claws @tab 1998-03-17 @tab birthday @tab Gave him a new flea collar
@item Whistler @tab 1998-12-09 @tab birthday @tab First birthday
@end multitable

Load the records like this:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'event.txt' INTO TABLE event;
@end example

Based on what you've learned from the queries you've run on the @code{pet}
table, you should be able to perform retrievals on the records in the
@code{event} table; the principles are the same.  But when is the
@code{event} table by itself insufficient to answer questions you might ask?

Suppose that you want to find out the ages at which each pet had its
litters. We saw earlier how to calculate ages from two dates.
The litter date of the mother is in the
@code{event} table, but to calculate her age on that date you need her
birth date, which is stored in the @code{pet} table.
This means the query requires both tables:

@example
mysql> SELECT pet.name,
    -> (YEAR(date)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(date,5)<RIGHT(birth,5)) AS age,
    -> remark
    -> FROM pet, event
    -> WHERE pet.name = event.name AND type = 'litter';
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| name   | age  | remark                      |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| Fluffy |    2 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
| Buffy  |    4 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
| Buffy  |    5 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
@end example

There are several things to note about this query:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{FROM} clause lists two tables because the query needs to pull
information from both of them.

@item
When combining (joining) information from multiple tables, you need to
specify how records in one table can be matched to records in the other.
This is easy because they both have a @code{name} column.  The query uses
@code{WHERE} clause to match up records in the two tables based on the
@code{name} values.

@item
Because the @code{name} column occurs in both tables, you must be specific
about which table you mean when referring to the column.  This is done
by prepending the table name to the column name.
@end itemize

You need not have two different tables to perform a join.  Sometimes it is
useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in a table
to other records in that same table.  For example, to find breeding pairs
among your pets, you can join the @code{pet} table with itself to produce
candidate pairs of males and females of like species:

@example
mysql> SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
    -> FROM pet AS p1, pet AS p2
    -> WHERE p1.species = p2.species AND p1.sex = 'f' AND p2.sex = 'm';
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
| Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
| Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
@end example

In this query, we specify aliases for the table name in order
to refer to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table
each column reference is associated with.

@section Getting Information About Databases and Tables

@cindex databases, information about
@cindex tables, information about
@findex DESCRIBE

What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the structure of
a given table is (for example, what its columns are called)?  MySQL
addresses this problem through several statements that provide information
about the databases and tables it supports.

You have already seen @code{SHOW DATABASES}, which lists the databases
managed by the server.  To find out which database is currently selected,
use the @code{DATABASE()} function:

@example
mysql> SELECT DATABASE();
+------------+
| DATABASE() |
+------------+
| menagerie  |
+------------+
@end example

If you haven't selected any database yet, the result is @code{NULL}
(or the empty string before MySQL 4.1.1).

To find out what tables the current database contains (for example, when
you're not sure about the name of a table), use this command:

@example
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| event               |
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
@end example

If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the @code{DESCRIBE}
command is useful; it displays information about each of a table's columns:

@example
mysql> DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
@end example

@code{Field} indicates the column name, @code{Type} is the data type for
the column, @code{NULL} indicates whether the column can contain
@code{NULL} values, @code{Key} indicates whether the column is
indexed, and @code{Default} specifies the column's default value.

If you have indexes on a table,
@code{SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name} produces information about them.


@node Batch mode, Examples, Getting information, Tutorial
@section Using @code{mysql} in Batch Mode

@cindex modes, batch
@cindex batch mode
@cindex running, batch mode
@cindex script files
@cindex files, script

In the previous sections, you used @code{mysql} interactively to enter
queries and view the results.  You can also run @code{mysql} in batch
mode.  To do this, put the commands you want to run in a file, then
tell @code{mysql} to read its input from the file:

@example
shell> mysql < batch-file
@end example

If you are running @code{mysql} under Windows and have some special
characters in the file that cause problems, you can do this:

@example
dos> mysql -e "source batch-file"
@end example

If you need to specify connection parameters on the command line, the
command might look like this:

@example
shell> mysql -h host -u user -p < batch-file
Enter password: ********
@end example

When you use @code{mysql} this way, you are creating a script file, then
executing the script.

If you want the script to continue even if some of the statements in it
produce errors, you should
use the @code{--force} command-line option.

Why use a script?  Here are a few reasons:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you run a query repeatedly (say, every day or every week), making it a
script allows you to avoid retyping it each time you execute it.

@item
You can generate new queries from existing ones that are similar by copying
and editing script files.

@item
Batch mode can also be useful while you're developing a query, particularly
for multiple-line commands or multiple-statement sequences of commands.  If
you make a mistake, you don't have to retype everything.  Just edit your
script to correct the error, then tell @code{mysql} to execute it again.

@item
If you have a query that produces a lot of output, you can run the output
through a pager rather than watching it scroll off the top of your screen:

@example
shell> mysql < batch-file | more
@end example

@item
You can catch the output in a file for further processing:

@example
shell> mysql < batch-file > mysql.out
@end example

@item
You can distribute your script to other people so they can run the commands,
too.

@item
Some situations do not allow for interactive use, for example, when you run
a query from a @code{cron} job.  In this case, you must use batch mode.
@end itemize

The default output format is different (more concise) when you run
@code{mysql} in batch mode than when you use it interactively.  For
example, the output of @code{SELECT DISTINCT species FROM pet} looks like
this when @code{mysql} is run interactively:

@example
+---------+
| species |
+---------+
| bird    |
| cat     |
| dog     |
| hamster |
| snake   |
+---------+
@end example

In batch mode, the output looks like this instead:

@example
species
bird
cat
dog
hamster
snake
@end example

If you want to get the interactive output format in batch mode, use
@code{mysql -t}.  To echo to the output the commands that are executed, use
@code{mysql -vvv}.

You can also use scripts from the @code{mysql} prompt by
using the @code{source} or @code{\.} command:

@example
mysql> source filename;
mysql> \. filename;
@end example


@node Examples, Twin, Batch mode, Tutorial
@section Examples of Common Queries

@cindex queries, examples
@cindex examples, queries

Here are examples of how to solve some common problems with
MySQL.

Some of the examples use the table @code{shop} to hold the price of each
article (item number) for certain traders (dealers).  Supposing that each
trader has a single fixed price per article, then (@code{article},
@code{dealer}) is a primary key for the records.

Start the command-line tool @code{mysql} and select a database:

@example
shell> mysql your-database-name
@end example

(In most MySQL installations, you can use the database name @code{test}).

You can create and populate the example table with these statements:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE shop (
    -> article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
    -> dealer  CHAR(20)                 DEFAULT ''     NOT NULL,
    -> price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
    -> PRIMARY KEY(article, dealer));
mysql> INSERT INTO shop VALUES
    -> (1,'A',3.45),(1,'B',3.99),(2,'A',10.99),(3,'B',1.45),
    -> (3,'C',1.69),(3,'D',1.25),(4,'D',19.95);
@end example

After issuing the statements, the table should have the following contents:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM shop;
+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | A      |  3.45 |
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | B      |  1.45 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |

@subsection The Row Holding the Maximum of a Certain Column

``Find number, dealer, and price of the most expensive article.''

In standard SQL (and MySQL Version 4.1) this is easily done with a subquery:

@example
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop);
@end example

In MySQL versions prior to 4.1, just do it in two steps:

@enumerate
@item
Get the maximum price value from the table with a @code{SELECT} statement.
@example
mysql> SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop;
+------------+
| MAX(price) |
+------------+
|      19.95 |
+------------+
@end example
@item
Using the value 19.95 shown by the previous query to be the maximum
article price, write a query to locate and display the corresponding record:
@example
mysql> SELECT article, dealer, price
    -> FROM   shop
    -> WHERE  price=19.95;
+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
@end example
@end enumerate

Another solution is to sort all rows descending by price and only
get the first row using the MySQL-specific @code{LIMIT} clause:

@example
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1;
@end example

@strong{Note:}  If there were several most expensive articles, each with a
price of 19.95, the @code{LIMIT} solution would show only one of them!


@node example-Maximum-column-group, example-Maximum-column-group-row, example-Maximum-row, Examples
@subsection Maximum of Column per Group

``What's the highest price per article?''

@example
SELECT article, MAX(price) AS price

| article | price |
+---------+-------+
|    0001 |  3.99 |
|    0002 | 10.99 |
|    0003 |  1.69 |
|    0004 | 19.95 |
+---------+-------+
@end example


@node example-Maximum-column-group-row, example-user-variables, example-Maximum-column-group, Examples
@subsection The Rows Holding the Group-wise Maximum of a Certain Field

``For each article, find the dealer or dealers with the most expensive price.''

In standard SQL (and MySQL Version 4.1 or greater), the problem can be solved
with a subquery like this:

@example
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop s1
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
              FROM shop s2
              WHERE s1.article = s2.article);
@end example

In MySQL versions prior to 4.1, it's best do it in several steps:

@enumerate
@item
Get the list of (article,maxprice) pairs.
@item
For each article, get the corresponding rows that have the stored maximum
price.
@end enumerate

This can easily be done with a temporary table and a join:

@example
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp (
        article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
        price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL);

LOCK TABLES shop READ;

INSERT INTO tmp SELECT article, MAX(price) FROM shop GROUP BY article;

SELECT shop.article, dealer, shop.price FROM shop, tmp
WHERE shop.article=tmp.article AND shop.price=tmp.price;

UNLOCK TABLES;

DROP TABLE tmp;
@end example

If you don't use a @code{TEMPORARY} table, you must also lock the @code{tmp}
table.

``Can it be done with a single query?''

Yes, but only by using a quite inefficient trick called the
``MAX-CONCAT trick'':

@example
SELECT article,
       SUBSTRING( MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 7) AS dealer,
  0.00+LEFT(      MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 6) AS price
FROM   shop
GROUP BY article;

+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
@end example

The last example can be made a bit more efficient by doing the
splitting of the concatenated column in the client.


@node example-user-variables, example-Foreign keys, example-Maximum-column-group-row, Examples
@subsection Using User Variables

You can use MySQL user variables to remember results without
having to store them in temporary variables in the client.
@xref{Variables}.

For example, to find the articles with the highest and lowest price you
can do this:

mysql> SELECT @@min_price:=MIN(price),@@max_price:=MAX(price) FROM shop;
mysql> SELECT * FROM shop WHERE price=@@min_price OR price=@@max_price;
+---------+--------+-------+

In MySQL 3.23.44 and up, @code{InnoDB} tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. @xref{InnoDB, , @code{InnoDB}}.
See also @ref{ANSI diff Foreign Keys}.

You don't actually need foreign keys to join two tables.
For table types other than @code{InnoDB},
the only things MySQL currently doesn't do are 1)
@code{CHECK} to make sure that the keys you use
really exist in the table or tables you're referencing and 2)
automatically delete rows from a table with a foreign key
definition. Using your keys to join tables will work just fine:

@example
CREATE TABLE person (
    id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name CHAR(60) NOT NULL,

);

CREATE TABLE shirt (

@node Searching on two keys, Calculating days, example-Foreign keys, Examples
@subsection Searching on Two Keys

@findex UNION
@cindex searching, two keys
@cindex keys, searching on two

MySQL doesn't yet optimize when you search on two different
keys combined with @code{OR} (searching on one key with different @code{OR}
parts is optimized quite well):

@example
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table
WHERE field1_index = '1' OR  field2_index = '1'
@end example

The reason is that we haven't yet had time to come up with an efficient
way to handle this in the general case. (The @code{AND} handling is,
in comparison, now completely general and works very well.)

In MySQL 4.0 and up, you can solve this problem efficiently by using a
@code{UNION} that combines the output of two separate @code{SELECT}
statements.
@xref{UNION}.
Each @code{SELECT} searches only one key and can be optimized:

@example
SELECT field1_index, field2_index
    FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1'
UNION
SELECT field1_index, field2_index
    FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
@end example

Prior to MySQL 4.0, you can achieve the same effect by using a
@code{TEMPORARY} table and separate @code{SELECT} statements.
This type of optimization is also very good if
you are using very complicated queries where the SQL server does the
optimizations in the wrong order.

@example
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index
    FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1';
INSERT INTO tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index
    FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
SELECT * from tmp;
DROP TABLE tmp;
@end example

This method of solving the problem is in effect a @code{UNION} of two queries.

@node Calculating days, example-AUTO_INCREMENT, Searching on two keys, Examples
@subsection Calculating Visits Per Day

@findex BIT_OR

@findex <<
@cindex bit_functions, example

The following example shows how you can use the bit group functions
to calculate the number of days per month a user has visited a Web page.

@example
CREATE TABLE t1 (year YEAR(4), month INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL,
             day INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2000,1,1),(2000,1,20),(2000,1,30),(2000,2,2),
            (2000,2,23),(2000,2,23);
@end example

The example table contains year-month-day values representing visits by users
to the page. To determine how many different days in each month these visits
occur, use this query:

@example
SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_OR(1<<day)) AS days FROM t1
       GROUP BY year,month;
@end example

Which returns:

@example
+------+-------+------+
| year | month | days |
+------+-------+------+
| 2000 |    01 |    3 |
| 2000 |    02 |    2 |
+------+-------+------+
@end example

The query calculates how many different days appear in the table for each
year/month combination, with automatic removal of duplicate entries.

             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id)
             );
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('dog'),('cat'),('penguin'),
                                  ('lax'),('whale'),('ostrich');
SELECT * FROM animals;
@end example

Which returns:

@example
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | dog     |
|  2 | cat     |
|  3 | penguin |
|  4 | lax     |
|  5 | whale   |
|  6 | ostrich |
+----+---------+
@end example

You can retrieve the most recent @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value with the
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} SQL function or the @code{mysql_insert_id()} C API
function. These functions are connection-specific, so their return value
is not affected by another connection also doing inserts.

Note: For a multiple-row insert,
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}/@code{mysql_insert_id()} will actually return the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} key from the @strong{first} of the inserted rows.
This allows multiple-row inserts to be reproduced correctly on other servers
in a replication setup.

For @code{MyISAM} and @code{BDB} tables you can specify @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
on a secondary column in a multiple-column index.  In this case, the generated
value for the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column is calculated as
@code{MAX(auto_increment_column)+1 WHERE prefix=given-prefix}.  This is
useful when you want to put data into ordered groups.

@example
CREATE TABLE animals (
             grp ENUM('fish','mammal','bird') NOT NULL,
             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (grp,id)
             );
INSERT INTO animals (grp,name) VALUES('mammal','dog'),('mammal','cat'),
                  ('bird','penguin'),('fish','lax'),('mammal','whale'),
                  ('bird','ostrich');
SELECT * FROM animals ORDER BY grp,id;
@end example

Which returns:

@example
+--------+----+---------+
| grp    | id | name    |
+--------+----+---------+
| fish   |  1 | lax     |
| mammal |  1 | dog     |
| mammal |  2 | cat     |
| mammal |  3 | whale   |
| bird   |  1 | penguin |
| bird   |  2 | ostrich |
+--------+----+---------+
@end example

Note that in this case (when the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column is part of a
multiple-column index), @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} values will be reused if you
delete the row with the biggest @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value in any group.
This happens even for @code{MyISAM} tables, for which @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
values normally are not reused.)

@section Queries from the Twin Project

@cindex Twin Studies, queries
@cindex queries, Twin Studies project

At Analytikerna and Lentus, we have been doing the systems and field work
for a big research project. This project is a collaboration between the
Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet Stockholm
and the Section on Clinical Research in Aging and Psychology at the
University of Southern California.

The project involves a screening part where all twins in Sweden older
than 65 years are interviewed by telephone. Twins who meet certain
criteria are passed on to the next stage. In this latter stage, twins who
want to participate are visited by a doctor/nurse team. Some of the
examinations include physical and neuropsychological examination,
laboratory testing, neuroimaging, psychological status assessment, and family
history collection. In addition, data are collected on medical and
environmental risk factors.

More information about Twin studies can be found at:
@uref{http://www.mep.ki.se/twinreg/index_en.html}

The latter part of the project is administered with a Web interface
written using Perl and MySQL.

Each night all data from the interviews is moved into a MySQL
database.

@end example

Some explanations:
@table @asis
@item @code{CONCAT(p1.id, p1.tvab) + 0 AS tvid}
We want to sort on the concatenated @code{id} and @code{tvab} in
numerical order. Adding @code{0} to the result causes MySQL to
treat the result as a number.
@item column @code{id}
This identifies a pair of twins. It is a key in all tables.
@item column @code{tvab}
This identifies a twin in a pair. It has a value of @code{1} or @code{2}.
@item column @code{ptvab}
This is an inverse of @code{tvab}. When @code{tvab} is @code{1} this is
@code{2}, and vice versa. It exists to save typing and to make it easier for
MySQL to optimize the query.
@end table

This query demonstrates, among other things, how to do lookups on a table
from the same table with a join (@code{p1} and @code{p2}). In the example,
this is used to check whether a twin's partner died before the age of 65. If
so, the row is not returned.

All of the above exist in all tables with twin-related information. We
have a key on both @code{id,tvab} (all tables), and @code{id,ptvab}
(@code{person_data}) to make queries faster.

On our production machine (A 200MHz UltraSPARC), this query returns
about 150-200 rows and takes less than one second.

Each interview ends with a status code called @code{event}. The query
shown here is used to display a table over all twin pairs combined by
event. This indicates in how many pairs both twins are finished, in how many

@section Using MySQL with Apache

@cindex Apache

There are programs that let you authenticate your users from a MySQL
database and also let you write your log files into a MySQL table.

You can change the Apache logging format to be easily readable by
MySQL by putting the following into the Apache configuration file:

@example
LogFormat \
        "\"%h\",%@{%Y%m%d%H%M%S@}t,%>s,\"%b\",\"%@{Content-Type@}o\",  \
        \"%U\",\"%@{Referer@}i\",\"%@{User-Agent@}i\""
@end example

To load a log file in that format into MySQL, you can use a statement
something like this:

@example
LOAD DATA INFILE '/local/access_log' INTO TABLE tbl_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\'
@end example

The named table should be created to have columns that correspond to those
that the @code{LogFormat} line writes to the log file.

Most programs have options that are specific to their own operation, but the
syntax for specifying options is similar for all of them. Later chapters
provide more detailed descriptions of individual programs, including which
options they recognize.

@item
@code{mysqld} is the MySQL server
@item
@code{mysqld_safe}, @code{mysql.server}, and @code{mysqld_multi} are server

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{myisamchk} performs table maintenance operations
@item
@code{myisampack} produces compressed, read-only tables
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} is a tool for processing binary log files

@end itemize

@c TODO: this table is missing some programs (e.g., replace).
@c TODO: not all programs named here have their own entries in the following

@end table

More information on running the server can be found in
@ref{Database Administration}.
Client and utility programs are described in more detail in
@ref{Client-Side Scripts}.

Most MySQL distribution formats include all of these programs, except for
those programs that are platform-specific. (For example, the server startup
scripts are not used on Windows.) The exception is that RPM distributions are
more specialized. There is one RPM for the server, another for the client
programs, and so forth. If you appear to be missing one or more programs,
see @ref{Installing} for information on distributions and what they contain.
It may be that you need to install something else.

@node Invoking Programs, Program Options, Program Overview, Using MySQL Programs
@section Invoking MySQL Programs

To invoke a MySQL program at the command line (that is, from your shell or
command prompt), enter the program name followed by any options or other
arguments needed to instruct the program what you want it to do. The following
commands show some sample program invocations. ``@code{shell>}'' represents
the prompt for your command interpreter; it is not part of what you type.

@example
shell> mysql test
shell> mysqladmin extended-status variables
shell> mysqlshow --help
shell> mysqldump --user=root personnel
@end example

Arguments that begin with a dash are option arguments. They typically specify
the type of connection a program should make to the server or affect its
operational mode. Options have a syntax that is described in
@ref{Program Options}.

Non-option arguments (arguments with no leading dash) provide additional
information to the program. For example, the @code{mysql} program interprets
the first non-option argument as a database name, so the command
@code{mysql test} indicates that you want to use the @code{test} database.

Later sections that describe individual programs indicate which options a
program understands and describe the meaning of any additional non-option
arguments.

Some options are common to a number of programs. The most common of these are
the @code{--host}, @code{--user}, and @code{--password} options that specify
connection parameters. They indicate the host where the MySQL server is
running, and the username and password of your MySQL account. All MySQL client
programs understand these options; they allow you to specify which server to
connect to and the account to use on that server.

@cindex PATH environment variable
@cindex environment varible, PATH

Note that you may find it necessary to invoke MySQL programs using the
pathname to the @file{bin} directory in which they are installed. This is
likely to be the case if you get a ``program not found'' error whenever
you attempt to run a MySQL program from any directory other than the
@file{bin} directory.  To make it more convenient to use MySQL, you
can add the pathname of the @file{bin} directory to your @code{PATH}
environment variable setting. Then to run a program you need only type
its name, not its entire pathname.

Consult the documentation for your command interpreter for instructions on
setting your @code{PATH}; the syntax for setting environment variables is
interpreter-specific.


@node Program Options,  , Invoking Programs, Using MySQL Programs
@section Specifying Program Options

You can provide options for MySQL programs in several ways:

@itemize @bullet

@item
On the command line following the program name. This is most common for
options that apply to a specific invocation of the program.

@item
In an option file that the program reads when it starts. This is common for
options that you want the program to use each time it runs.

@item
In environment variables. These are useful for options that you want to apply
each time the program runs, though in practice option files are used more
commonly for this purpose.
(@ref{Multiple Unix servers} discusses one situation in which environment
variables can be very helpful. It describes a handy technique that uses such
variables to specify the TCP/IP port number and Unix socket file for both
the server and client programs.)

@end itemize

MySQL programs determine which options are given by examining environment
variables first, then option files, then the command line.
If an option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence takes
precedence.
This means that environment variables have the lowest precedence and
command-line options the highest.

You can take advantage of the way that MySQL programs process options by
specifying the default values for a program's options in an option file. Then
you need not type them each time you run the program, but can override the
defaults if necessary by using command-line options.

@end menu

@node Command-line options, Option files, Program Options, Program Options
@subsection Using Options on the Command Line

Program options specified on the command line follow these rules:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Options are given after the command name.

@item
An option argument begins with one dash or two dashes, depending on whether
it has a short name or a long name. Many options have both forms.
For example, @code{-?} and @code{--help} are the short and long forms
of the option that instructs a MySQL program to display a help message.

@item
Option names are case sensitive.  @code{-v} and @code{-V} are both legal and
have different meanings. (They are the corresponding short forms of the
@code{--verbose} and @code{--version} options.)

@item
Some options take a value following the option name.
For example, @code{-h localhost} or @code{--host=localhost} indicate
the MySQL server host to a client program.  The option value
tells the program the name of the host where the MySQL server is running.

@item
For a long option that takes a value, separate the option name and the value by an @samp{=} sign.
For a short option that takes a value, the option value can immediately follow the option letter,
or there can be a space between.
(@code{-hlocalhost} and @code{-h localhost} are equivalent.)
An exception to this rule is the option for specifying your MySQL password.
This option can be given in long form as @code{--password=pass_val} or as
@code{--password}. In the latter case (with no password value given), the
program will prompt you for the password.
The password option also may be given in short form as @code{-ppass_val} or as
@code{-p}. However, for the short form, if the password value is given, it
must follow the option letter with @emph{no intervening space}. The reason for
this is that if a space follows the option letter, the program has no way to
tell whether a following argument is supposed to be the password value or some
other kind of argument.  Consequently, the following two commands have two
completely different meanings:

@example
shell> mysql -ptest
shell> mysql -p test
@end example

The first command instructs @code{mysql} to use a password value of
@code{test}, but specifies no default database.
The second instructs @code{mysql} to prompt for the password value
and to use @code{test} as the default database.

@end itemize

MySQL 4.0 introduced some additional flexibility in the way you specify
options. These changes were made in MySQL 4.0.2. Some of them relate to the way
you specify options that have ``enabled'' and ``disabled'' states, and to the
use of options that might be present in one version of MySQL but not another.
Those capabilities are discussed in this section.
Another change pertains to the way you use options to set program variables.
@ref{Program variables} discusses that topic further.

@c TODO: also: can specify unambigious prefix of option -- hm, but that's
@c not 4.0.2 (?), so it should be mentioned earlier.

Some options control behavior that can be turned on or off. For example,
the @code{mysql} client supports a @code{--column-names} option that
determines whether or not to display a row of column names at the beginning
of query results. By default, this option is enabled. However, you may
want to disable it in some instances, such as when sending the output
of @code{mysql} into another program that expects to see only data and
not an initial header line.

To disable column names, you can specify the option using any of these forms:

@example
--disable-column-names
--skip-column-names
--column-names=0
@end example

The @code{--disable} and @code{--skip} prefixes and the @code{=0} suffix
all have the same effect: They turn the option off.

The ``enabled'' form of the option may be specified in any of these ways:

@example
--column-names
--enable-column-names
--column-names=1
@end example

Another change to option processing introduced in MySQL 4.0 is that you
can use the @code{--loose} prefix for command-line options. If an option
is prefixed by @code{--loose}, the program will not exit with
an error if it does not recognize the option, but instead will issue
only a warning:

@example
shell> mysql --loose-no-such-option
mysql: WARNING: unknown option '--no-such-option'
@end example

The @code{--loose} prefix can be useful when you run programs from
multiple installations of MySQL on the same machine, at least if all the
versions are as recent as 4.0.2.  This prefix is particularly useful when you
list options in an option file.  An option that may not be recognized by all
versions of a program can be given using the @code{--loose}
prefix (or @code{loose} in an option file). Versions of the program that do
not recognize the option will issue a warning and ignore it. This
strategy requires that versions involved be 4.0.2 or later, because
earlier versions know nothing of the @code{--loose} convention.


@node Option files, Environment variable options, Command-line options, Program Options
@subsection Using Option Files

@cindex default options
@cindex option files
@cindex creating, default startup options
@cindex startup options, default

MySQL programs can read startup options from option
files (also sometimes called configuration files).
Option files provide a convenient way to specify commonly used options so that
they need not be entered on the command line each time you run a program.
Option file capability is available from MySQL 3.22 on.

The following programs support option files:  @code{mysql},
@code{mysqladmin}, @code{mysqld}, @code{mysqld_safe}, @code{mysql.server},
@code{mysqldump}, @code{mysqlimport}, @code{mysqlshow}, @code{mysqlcheck},
@code{mysqlhotcopy},
@code{myisamchk}, and @code{myisampack}.

On Windows, MySQL programs read startup options from the following files:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .70
@item @strong{Filename} @tab @strong{Purpose}
@item @code{windows-dir\my.ini} @tab Global options
@item @code{C:\my.cnf} @tab Global options
@end multitable

@code{windows-dir} represents the location of your Windows directory.
This is commonly @file{C:\Windows} or @file{C:\WinNT}. Check the value of the
@code{WINDIR} environment variable to see where this directory is located on
your system.

On Unix, MySQL programs read startup options from the following files:

@tindex .my.cnf file
@multitable @columnfractions .30 .70
@item @strong{Filename} @tab @strong{Purpose}
@item @code{/etc/my.cnf} @tab Global options
@item @code{DATADIR/my.cnf} @tab Server-specific options
@item @code{defaults-extra-file} @tab The file specified with @code{--defaults-extra-file=path}, if any
@item @code{~/.my.cnf} @tab User-specific options
@end multitable

@code{DATADIR} represents the location of the MySQL data directory. Typically
this is @file{/usr/local/mysql/data} for a binary installation or
@file{/usr/local/var} for a source installation.  Note that this is the data
directory location that was specified at configuration time, not the
one specified with @code{--datadir} when @code{mysqld} starts.
Use of @code{--datadir} at runtime has no effect on where the server
looks for option files, because it looks for them before processing any
command-line arguments.

MySQL looks for option files in the order just listed and reads any that
exist. If an option file that you want to use does not exist, create it
with a plain text editor.
If multiple option files exist, an option specified in a file read later takes
precedence over the same option specified in a file read earlier.

Any long option that may be given on the command line when running a
MySQL program can be given in an option file as well.  To get the list
of available options for a program, run it with the @code{--help} option.

The syntax for
specifying options in an option file is similar to command-line syntax, except
that you omit the leading two dashes. For example, @code{--quick} or
@code{--host=localhost} on the command line should be specified as
@code{quick} or @code{host=localhost} in an option file.
To specify an option of the form @code{--loose-opt_name}
in an option file, write it as @code{loose-opt_name}.

Empty lines in option files are ignored. Non-empty lines can take any
of the following forms:

@table @code
@item #comment
@itemx ;comment
Comment lines start with @samp{#} or @samp{;}. As of MySQL 4.0.14, 
a @samp{#}-comment can start in the middle of a line as well.

@item [group]
@code{group} is the name of the program or group for which you want to set
options.  After a group line, any @code{opt_name} or @code{set-variable} lines
apply to the named group until the end of the option file or another group
line is given.

@item opt_name
This is equivalent to @code{--opt_name} on the command line.

@item opt_name=value
This is equivalent to @code{--opt_name=value} on the command line.
In an option file, you can have spaces around the @samp{=} character,
something that is not true on the command line.
As of
MySQL 4.0.16, you can quote the value with double quotes or single quotes.
This is useful if the value contains a @samp{#} comment character or whitespace.

@item set-variable = var_name=value
Set the program variable @code{var_name} to the given value.
This is equivalent to @code{--set-variable=var_name=value} on the
command line.
Spaces are allowed around the first @samp{=} character but not around
the second.
This syntax is deprecated as of MySQL 4.0.
See @ref{Program variables} for more information on setting program variables.
@end table

Note that for options and values, all leading and trailing blanks are
automatically deleted.  You may use the escape sequences @samp{\b},
@samp{\t}, @samp{\n}, @samp{\r}, @samp{\\}, and @samp{\s} in option values
to represent the backspace, tab, newline, carriage return, and space characters.

On Windows, if an option value represents a pathname, you should specify the
value using @samp{/} rather than @samp{\} as the pathname separator. If you
use @samp{\}, you must double it as @samp{\\},
because @samp{\} is the escape character in MySQL.

If an option group name is the same as a program name, options in the group
apply specifically to that program.

The @code{[client]} option group is read by all client programs
(but not by @code{mysqld}). This allows you to specify options that apply to
every client. For example, @code{[client]} is the perfect group to use
to specify the password that you use to connect to the server.  (But make
sure that the option file is readable and writable only by yourself, so that other
people cannot find out your password.) Be sure not
to put an option in the @code{[client]} group unless it is recognized by
@emph{all} client programs.

As of MySQL 4.0.14, if you want to create option groups that should only be
read by one specific @code{mysqld} server release series, you can do this by
using groups with names of @code{[mysqld-4.0]}, @code{[mysqld-4.1]}, and so
forth. The following group indicates that the @code{--new} option should be
used only by MySQL servers with 4.0.x version numbers:

@example
[mysqld-4.0]
new
@end example

Here is a typical global option file:

@example
[client]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

[mysqld]
port=3306
socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
key_buffer_size=16M
max_allowed_packet=1M

[mysqldump]
quick
@end example

Here is a typical user option file:

@example
[client]
# The following password will be sent to all standard MySQL clients
password="my_password"

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash
set-variable = connect_timeout=2

[mysqlhotcopy]
interactive-timeout

@end example

@tindex .my.cnf file
If you have a source distribution, you will find sample option
files named @file{my-xxxx.cnf} in the @file{support-files} directory.
If you have a binary distribution, look in the @file{support-files}
directory under your MySQL installation directory (typically @file{C:\mysql}
on Windows or @file{/usr/local/mysql} on Unix).  Currently
there are sample option files for small, medium, large, and very
large systems. To experiment with one of these files, copy it to
@file{C:\my.cnf} on Windows or to @file{.my.cnf} in your home directory on
Unix.

All MySQL programs that support option files handle the
following command-line options:

@table @code

@item --no-defaults
Don't read any option files.

@item --print-defaults
Print the program name and all options that it will get from option files.

@item --defaults-file=path_name
Use only the given option file. @code{path_name} is the full pathname
to the file.

@item --defaults-extra-file=path_name
Read this option file after the global option file but before the user
option file. @code{path_name} is the full pathname to the file.

@end table

Note that to work properly, each of these options must immediately
follow the command name on the command line, with the exception
that @code{--print-defaults} may be used immediately after
@code{--defaults-file} or @code{--defaults-extra-file}.

@c TODO: next few paragraphs probably should go into API chapter.

In shell scripts, you can use the @code{my_print_defaults} program to parse the
option files. The following example shows the output that
@code{my_print_defaults} might produce when asked to show the options found in
the @code{[client]} and @code{[mysql]} groups:

@example

shell> my_print_defaults client mysql
--port=3306
--socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
--no-auto-rehash
@end example

Note for developers:  Option file handling is implemented in the C client
library simply by
processing all matching options (that is, options in the appropriate group)
before any command-line arguments. This works nicely for programs that use
the last instance of an option that is specified multiple times. If you have
a C or C++ program that handles multiply specified options this way but doesn't
read option files, you need add only two lines to give it that capability.
Check the source code of any of the standard MySQL clients to see
how to do this.

Several other language interfaces to MySQL are based on the C client library,
and some of them provide a way to access option file contents. These include
Perl and Python. See the documentation for your preferred interface for
details.


@node Environment variable options, Program variables, Option files, Program Options
@subsection Using Environment Variables to Specify Options

@cindex environment variables

To specify an option using an environment variable, set the variable using the
syntax appropriate for your comment processor. For example, on Windows or
NetWare,
you can set the @code{USER} variable to specify your MySQL account name.
To do so, use this syntax:

@example
SET USER=your_name
@end example

The syntax on Unix depends on your shell. Suppose that you want to specify the
TCP/IP port number using the @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT} variable. The syntax for
Bourne shell and variants (@code{sh}, @code{bash}, @code{zsh}, etc.) is:

@example
MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3306
@end example

For @code{csh} and @code{tcsh}, use this syntax:

@example
setenv MYSQL_TCP_PORT 3306
@end example

The commands to set environment variables can be executed at your command
prompt to take effect immediately. These settings persist until you log out.
To have the settings take effect each time you log in,
place the appropriate command or commands in a startup file that your
command interpreter reads each time it starts. Typical startup files are
@file{AUTOEXEC.BAT} for Windows, @file{.bash_profile} for @code{bash}, or
@file{.tcshrc} for @code{tcsh}. Consult the documentation for your command
interpreter for specific details.

@ref{Environment variables} lists all environment variables that affect MySQL
program operation.

@subsection Using Options to Set Program Variables

@cindex program variables, setting
@cindex setting program variables

@c TODO: check whether program variables can be set by unique prefix.

Many MySQL programs have internal variables that can be set at runtime.
As of MySQL 4.0.2, program
variables are set the same way as any other long option that takes a value.
For example, @code{mysql} has a @code{max_allowed_packet} variable that
controls the maximum size of its communication buffer.
To set the @code{max_allowed_packet} variable for @code{mysql} to a value of
64MB, use either of the following commands:

@example
shell> mysql --max_allowed_packet=6710740
shell> mysql --max_allowed_packet=64M
@end example

The first command specifies the value in bytes. The second specifies the value
in megabytes. Variable values can have a suffix of @code{K}, @code{M}, or
@code{G} (either uppercase or lowercase) to indicate units of kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes.

In an option file, the variable setting is given without the leading dashes:

@example
[mysql]
max_allowed_packet=6710740
@end example

Or:

@example
[mysql]
max_allowed_packet=64M
@end example

If you like, underscores in a variable name can be specified as dashes.

Prior to MySQL 4.0.2, program variable names are not recognized as option
names.
Instead, use the @code{--set-variable} option to assign a value to a variable:

@example
shell> mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=6710740
shell> mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=64M
@end example

In an option file, omit the leading dashes:

@example
[mysql]
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=6710740
@end example

Or:

@example
[mysql]
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=64M
@end example

With @code{--set-variable}, underscores in variable names cannot be given as
dashes for versions of MySQL older than 4.0.2.

The @code{--set-variable} option is still recognized in MySQL 4.0.2 and up,
but is deprecated.

Some server variables can be set at runtime. For details, see
@ref{Server system variables} and @ref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET OPTION}}.

@cindex programs, list of

All MySQL programs take many different options. However, every
MySQL program provides a @code{--help} option that you can use
to get a description of the program's options. For example, try
@code{mysqld --help}.

You can override default options for all standard programs by specifying
options on the command line or in an option file.
@ref{Program Options}.

The following list briefly describes the MySQL server and server-related
programs:

@table @code

@item mysqld
@cindex @code{mysqld}
The SQL daemon (that is, the MySQL server). To use client programs, this
program must be running, because clients gain access to databases by
connecting to the server.
@xref{Configuring MySQL}.

@item mysqld-max
@cindex @code{mysqld-max}
A version of the server that includes additional features.
@xref{mysqld-max,  , @code{mysqld-max}}.

@item mysqld_safe
@cindex @code{mysqld_safe}
A server startup script.
@code{mysqld_safe} attempts to start @code{mysqld-max} if it exists, and
@code{mysqld} otherwise.
@xref{mysqld_safe,  , @code{mysqld_safe}}.

@item mysql.server
@cindex @code{mysql.server}
A server startup script.
This script is used on systems that use run directories containing scripts
that start system services for particular run levels. It invokes
@code{mysqld_safe} to start the MySQL server.
@xref{mysql.server,  , @code{mysql.server}}.

@item mysqld_multi
@cindex @code{mysqld_multi}
A server startup script that can start or stop multiple servers installed
on the system.
@xref{mysqld_multi,  , @code{mysqld_multi}}.

@item mysql_install_db
@cindex @code{mysql_install_db}
This script creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. It is
usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL on a system.

@item mysql_fix_privilege_tables
@cindex @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables}
This script is used after an upgrade install operation, to update the grant
tables with any changes that have been made in newer versions of MySQL.

@end table

There are several other programs that also are run on the server host:

@c TODO: indicate where these are discussed

@table @code

@item myisamchk
@cindex @code{myisamchk}
A utility to describe, check, optimize, and repair @code{MyISAM} tables.
@code{myisamchk} is described in
@ref{Table maintenance}.

@item make_binary_distribution
@cindex @code{make_binary_distribution}

@node mysqld-max, mysqld_safe, Server-Side Overview, Server-Side Scripts
@subsection The @code{mysqld-max} Extended MySQL Server

@cindex @code{mysqld-max}

A MySQL-Max server is a version of the @code{mysqld} MySQL server that
has been built to include additional features.

The distribution to use depends on your platform:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For Windows, the MySQL binary distributions include both the standard server
(@code{mysqld.exe}) and the MySQL-Max server (@code{mysqld-max.exe}), so you
need not get a special distribution. Just use a regular Windows
distribution, available at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html}.
@xref{Windows installation}.

@item
For Linux, if you install MySQL using RPM distributions, use the regular
@code{MySQL-server} RPM first to install a standard server named
@code{mysqld}.  Then use the @code{MySQL-Max} RPM to install a server named
@code{mysqld-max}.  The @code{MySQL-Max} RPM presupposes that you have
already installed the regular server RPM.  See @ref{Linux-RPM} for more
information on the Linux RPM packages.

@item
All other MySQL-Max distributions contain a single server that is named
@code{mysqld} but that has the additional features included.

@end itemize

You can find the MySQL-Max binaries on the MySQL AB Web site at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html}.

MySQL AB builds the MySQL-Max servers by using the following
@code{configure} options:

@table @code

@item --with-server-suffix=-max
This option adds a @code{-max} suffix to the @code{mysqld} version string.

@item --with-innodb
This option enables support for the @code{InnoDB} storage engine.  MySQL-Max
servers always include @code{InnoDB} support, but this option actually is
used only for MySQL 3.23 because @code{InnoDB} is not included by default
until MySQL 4.  From MySQL 4 on, @code{InnoDB} is included by default in
binary distributions, so you do not need a MySQL-Max server to obtain
@code{InnoDB} support.

@item --with-bdb
This option enables support for the Berkeley DB (@code{BDB}) storage engine.

@item CFLAGS=-DUSE_SYMDIR
This define enables symbolic link support for Windows.

@end table

MySQL-Max binary distributions are a convenience for those who wish to install
precompiled programs. If you build MySQL using a source distribution, you can
build your own Max-like server by enabling the same features at configuration
time that the MySQL-Max binary distributions are built with.

MySQL-Max servers include the BerkeleyDB (@code{BDB}) storage engine
whenever possible, but not all platforms support @code{BDB}.  The following
table shows which platforms allow MySQL-Max binaries to include @code{BDB}:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .20
@item @strong{System}    @tab @code{BDB} @strong{Support}
@item AIX 4.3            @tab N
@item HP-UX 11.0         @tab N
@item Linux-Alpha        @tab N
@item Linux-IA-64        @tab N
@item Linux-Intel        @tab Y
@item Mac OS X           @tab N
@item NetWare            @tab N
@item SCO OSR5           @tab Y
@item Solaris-Intel      @tab N
@item Solaris-SPARC      @tab Y
@item UnixWare           @tab Y
@item Windows/NT         @tab Y
@end multitable

To find out which storage engines your server supports, issue the following
statement:

@example
mysql> SHOW ENGINES;
@end example

Before MySQL 4.1.2, use the following statement instead and check the value
of the variable for the storage engine in which you are interested:

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_%';
+------------------+----------+
| Variable_name    | Value    |
+------------------+----------+
| have_bdb         | NO       |
| have_crypt       | YES      |
| have_innodb      | YES      |
| have_isam        | NO       |
| have_raid        | NO       |
| have_symlink     | DISABLED |
| have_openssl     | NO       |
| have_query_cache | YES      |
+------------------+----------+
@end example

The values in the second column indicate the server's level of support for
each feature:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @strong{Value}  @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{YES}      @tab The feature is supported and is active.
@item @code{NO}       @tab The feature is not supported.
@item @code{DISABLED} @tab The feature is supported but has been disabled.
@end multitable

A value of @code{NO} means that the server was compiled without support
for the feature, so it cannot be activated at runtime.

A value of @code{DISABLED} occurs either because the server was
started with an option that disables the feature, or because not
all options required to enable it were given. In the latter case, the
@code{hostname.err} error log file should contain a reason indicating why
the option is disabled.

One situation in which you might see @code{DISABLED} occurs with MySQL 3.23
when the @code{InnoDB} storage engine is compiled in. In MySQL 3.23, you
must supply at least the @code{innodb_data_file_path} option at runtime to
set up the @code{InnoDB} tablespace. Without this option, @code{InnoDB}
disables itself.
@xref{InnoDB in MySQL 3.23,  , @code{InnoDB} in MySQL 3.23}.
You can specify configuration options for the @code{BDB} storage engine, too,
but @code{BDB} will not disable itself if you do not provide them.
@xref{BDB start,  , @code{BDB} start}.

You might also see @code{DISABLED} for the @code{InnoDB}, @code{BDB}, or
@code{ISAM} storage engines if the server was compiled to support them, but
was started with the @code{--skip-innodb}, @code{--skip-bdb}, or
@code{--skip-isam} options at runtime.

As of Version 3.23, all MySQL servers support @code{MyISAM} tables, because
@code{MyISAM} is the default storage engine.

@subsection The @code{mysqld_safe} Server Startup Script

@cindex tools, safe_mysqld
@cindex scripts
@cindex @code{mysqld_safe}
@cindex @code{safe_mysqld}

@code{mysqld_safe} is the recommended way to start a @code{mysqld}
server on Unix and NetWare.  @code{mysqld_safe} adds some safety features
such as restarting the server when an error occurs and logging run-time
information to an error log file. NetWare-specific behaviors are listed
later in this section.

@strong{Note:}
Before MySQL 4.0, @code{mysqld_safe} is named @code{safe_mysqld}.
To preserve backward compatibility, MySQL binary distributions for
some time will include @code{safe_mysqld} as a symbolic link to
@code{mysqld_safe}.

By default, @code{mysqld_safe} tries to start an executable named
@code{mysqld-max} if it exists, or @code{mysqld} otherwise.
Be aware of the implications of this behavior:

@itemize @bullet

@item
On Linux, the @code{MySQL-Max} RPM relies on this @code{mysqld_safe}
behavior. The RPM installs an executable named @code{mysqld-max}, which
causes @code{mysqld_safe} to automatically use that executable from that
point on.

@item
If you install a MySQL-Max distribution that includes a server named
@code{mysqld-max}, then upgrade later to a non-Max version of MySQL,
@code{mysqld_safe} will still attempt to run the old @code{mysqld-max}
server.  If you perform such an upgrade, you should manually remove the old
@code{mysqld-max} server to ensure that @code{mysqld_safe} runs the new
@code{mysqld} server.

@end itemize

To override the default behavior and specify explicitly which server you
want to run, specify a @code{--mysqld} or @code{--mysqld-version} option to
@code{mysqld_safe}..

Many of the options to @code{mysqld_safe} are the same as the options to
@code{mysqld}. @xref{Server options}.

Note that all options specified to @code{mysqld_safe} on the command line are
passed to @code{mysqld}.  If you want to use any options that are specific
to @code{mysqld_safe} and that @code{mysqld} doesn't support, do not specify
them on the command line. Instead, list in the @code{[mysqld_safe]} group
of an option file.
@xref{Option files}.

@code{mysqld_safe} reads all options from the @code{[mysqld]},
@code{[server]} and @code{[mysqld_safe]} sections in option files.
(For backward compatibility, it also reads @code{[safe_mysqld]}
sections, though you should rename such sections to @code{[mysqld_safe]}
when you begin using MySQL 4.0 or later.)

@code{mysqld_safe} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --basedir=path
The path to the MySQL installation directory.

@item --core-file-size=size
The size of the core file @code{mysqld} should be able to create. The option
value is passed to @code{ulimit -c}.

@item --datadir=path
The path to the data directory.

@item --defaults-extra-file=path
The name of an option file to be read in addition to the usual option files.

@item --defaults-file=path
The name of an option file to be read instead of the usual option files.

@item --err-log=path
The old form of the @code{--log-error} option, to be used before MySQL 4.0.

@item --ledir=path
The path to the directory containing the @code{mysqld} program.
Use this option to explicitly indicate the location of the server.

@item --log-error=path
Write the error log to the given file. @xref{Error log}.

@item --mysqld=prog_name
The name of the server program (in the @code{ledir} directory) that you
want to start. This option is needed if you use the MySQL binary distribution
but have the data directory outside of the binary distribution.

@item --mysqld-version=suffix
This option is similar to the @code{--mysqld} option, but you specify only
the suffix for the server program name. The basename is assumed to be
@code{mysqld}.  For example, if you use @code{--mysqld-version=max},
@code{mysqld_safe} will start the @code{mysqld-max} program in the
@code{ledir} directory.  If the argument to @code{--mysqld-version} is
empty, @code{mysqld_safe} uses @code{mysqld} in the @code{ledir} directory.

@item --nice=priority
Use the @code{nice} program to set the server's scheduling priority to the
given value.  This option was added in MySQL 4.0.14.

@item --no-defaults
Do not read any option files.

@item --open-files-limit=count
The number of files @code{mysqld} should be able to open. The option value
is passed to @code{ulimit -n}. Note that you need to start
@code{mysqld_safe} as @code{root} for this to work properly!

@item --pid-file=path
The path to the process ID file.

@item --port=port_num
The port number to use when listening for TCP/IP connections.

@item --socket=path
The Unix socket file to use for local connections.

@item --timezone=zone
Set the @code{TZ} time zone environment variable to the given option value.
Consult your operating system documentation for legal time zone
specification formats.

@item --user=@{user_name | user_id@}
Run the @code{mysqld} server as the user having the name @code{user_name} or
the numeric user ID @code{user_id}.
(``User'' in this context refers to a system login account, not a MySQL user
listed in the grant tables.)

@end table

The @code{mysqld_safe} script is written so that it normally can start a
server that was installed from either a source or a binary distribution of
MySQL, even though these types of distributoins typically install the server
in slightly different locations.
(@xref{Installation layouts}.)
@code{mysqld_safe} expects one of the following conditions to be true:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The server and databases can be found relative to the directory from which
@code{mysqld_safe} is invoked.  For binary distributions, @code{mysqld_safe}
looks under its working directory for @file{bin} and @file{data}
directories.  For source distributions, it looks for @file{libexec} and
@file{var} directories.  This condition should be met if you execute
@code{mysqld_safe} from your MySQL installation directory (for example,
@file{/usr/local/mysql} for a binary distribution).

@item
If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working
directory, @code{mysqld_safe} attempts to locate them by absolute pathnames.
Typical locations are @file{/usr/local/libexec} and @file{/usr/local/var}.
The actual locations are determined from the values configured into the
distribution at the time it was built.  They should be correct if MySQL
is installed in the location specified at configuration time.
@end itemize

Because @code{mysqld_safe} will try to find the server and databases relative
to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
MySQL anywhere, as long as you run @code{mysqld_safe} from the
MySQL installation directory:

@example
shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
shell> bin/mysqld_safe &
@end example

If @code{mysqld_safe} fails, even when invoked from the MySQL
installation directory, you can specify the @code{--ledir} and
@code{--datadir} options to indicate the directories in which the server and
databases are located on your system.

Normally, you should not edit the @code{mysqld_safe} script.  Instead,
configure @code{mysqld_safe} by using command-line options or options in the
@code{[mysqld_safe]} section of a @file{my.cnf} option file.  In rare cases,
it might be necessary to edit @code{mysqld_safe} to get it to start the server
properly. However, if you do this, your modified version of
@code{mysqld_safe} might be overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future, so
you should make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.

On NetWare, @code{mysqld_safe} is a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) that is
ported from the original Unix shell script.  It does the following:

@enumerate
@item
Runs a number of system and option checks.

@item
Runs a check on @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables.

@item
Provides a screen presence for the MySQL server.

@item
Starts @code{mysqld}, monitors it, and restarts it if it terminates in error.

@item
Sends error messages from @code{mysqld} to the @file{hostname.err} file in the
data directory.

@item
Sends @code{mysqld_safe} screen output to the @file{hostname.safe} file in the
data directory.

@end enumerate


@node mysql.server, mysqld_multi, mysqld_safe, Server-Side Scripts
@subsection The @code{mysql.server} Server Startup Script

MySQL distributions on Unix include a script named @code{mysql.server}.
It can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris that use System V-style
run directories to start and stop system services. It is also used by the Mac
OS X Startup Item for MySQL.

@code{mysql.server} can be found in the @file{support-files} directory under
your MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source tree.

Note that if you use the Linux server RPM package
(@code{MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm}), the @code{mysql.server} script will
already have been installed in the @file{/etc/init.d} directory with the
name @file{mysql}. You need not install it manually. See
@ref{Linux-RPM} for more information on the Linux RPM packages.

If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary distribution
format that does not install @code{mysql.server} automatically, you can
install it manually. Instructions are provided in @ref{Automatic start}.

@code{mysql.server} reads options from the @code{[mysql.server]} and
@code{[mysqld]} sections of option files.  (For backward compatibility,
it also reads @code{[mysql_server]} sections, though you should rename such
sections to @code{[mysql.server]} when you begin using MySQL 4.0 or later.)


@node mysqld_multi,  , mysql.server, Server-Side Scripts
@subsection The @code{mysqld_multi} Program for Managing Multiple MySQL Servers

@cindex tools, mysqld_multi
@cindex scripts
@cindex multi mysqld
@cindex @code{mysqld_multi}

@code{mysqld_multi} is meant for managing several @code{mysqld}
processes that listen for connections on different Unix socket files and
TCP/IP ports.  It can start or stop servers, or report their current status.

The program searches for groups named @code{[mysqld#]} in @file{my.cnf} (or
in the file named by the @code{--config-file} option).  @code{#} can be any
positive integer.  This number is referred to in the following discussion as
the option group number, or GNR.  Group numbers distinquish option groups
from one another and are used as arguments to @code{mysqld_multi} to specify
which servers you want to start, stop, or obtain a status report for.
Options listed in these groups are the same that you would use in the
@code{[mysqld]} group used for starting @code{mysqld}.  (See, for example,
@ref{Automatic start}.) However, when using multiple servers it is necessary
that each one use its own value for options such as the Unix socket file and
TCP/IP port number. For more information on which options must be unique per
server in a multiple-server environment, see @ref{Multiple servers}.

To invoke @code{mysqld_multi}, use the following syntax:

@example
shell> mysqld_multi [options] @{start|stop|report@} [GNR[,GNR]...]
@end example

@code{start}, @code{stop}, and @code{report} indicate which operation you
want to perform. You can perform the designated operation on a single server
or multiple servers, depending on the GNR list that follows the option name.
If there is no list, @code{mysqld_multi} performs the operation for all
servers in the option file.

Each GNR value represents an option group number or range of group numbers.
The value should be the number at the end of the group name in the
option file.  For example, the GNR for a group named @code{[mysqld17]}
is @code{17}.  To specify a range of numbers, separate the first and last
numbers by a dash.  The GNR value @code{10-13} represents groups
@code{[mysqld10]} through @code{[mysqld13]}.  Multiple groups or group
ranges can be specified on the command line, separated by commas.  There
must be no whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) in the GNR list; anything
after a whitespace character is ignored.

This command starts a single server using option group @code{[mysqld17]}:

@example
shell> mysqld_multi start 17
@end example

This command stops several servers, using option groups @code{[mysql8]}
and @code{[mysqld10]} through @code{[mysqld13]}:

@example
shell> mysqld_multi start 8,10-13
@end example

For an example of how you might set up an option file, use this command:

@example
shell> mysqld_multi --example
@end example

@code{mysqld_multi} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --config-file=name
@cindex @code{config-file}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Specify the name of an alternative option file. This affects where
@code{mysqld_multi} looks for @code{[mysqld#]} option groups.  Without this
option, all options are read from the usual @file{my.cnf} file.  The option
does not affect where @code{mysqld_multi} reads its own options, which are
always taken from the @code{[mysqld_multi]} group in the usual @file{my.cnf}
file.

@item --example
@cindex @code{example}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Display an example option file.

@item --help
@cindex @code{help}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Display a help message and exit.

@item --log=name
@cindex @code{log}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Specify the name of the log file. If the file exists, log output is appended
to it.

@item --mysqladmin=prog_name
@cindex @code{mysqladmin}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
The @code{mysqladmin} binary to be used to stop servers.

@item --mysqld=prog_name
@cindex @code{mysqld}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
The @code{mysqld} binary to be used. Note that you can specify
@code{mysqld_safe} as the value for this option also. The options are passed
to @code{mysqld}. Just make sure that you have the directory where @code{mysqld} is
located in your @code{PATH}
environment variable setting or fix @code{mysqld_safe}.

@item --no-log
@cindex @code{no-log}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Print log information to stdout rather than to the log file. By default,
output goes to the log file.

@item --password=password
@cindex @code{password}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
The password of the MySQL account to use when invoking @code{mysqladmin}.
Note that the password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MySQL clients.

@item --tcp-ip
@cindex @code{tcp-ip}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Connect to each MySQL server via the TCP/IP port instead of the Unix socket
file.  (If a socket file is missing, the server might still be running,
but accessible only via the TCP/IP port.)  By default, connections are
made using the Unix socket file.  This option affects @code{stop} and
@code{report} operations.

@item --user=user_name
@cindex @code{user}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
The username of the MySQL account to use when invoking @code{mysqladmin}.

@item --version
@cindex @code{version}, @code{mysqld_multi} option
Display version information and exit.

@end table

Some notes about @code{mysqld_multi}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Make sure that the MySQL account used for stopping the @code{mysqld} servers
(with the @code{mysqladmin} program) has the same username and password for
each server. Also, make sure that the account has the @code{SHUTDOWN}
privilege. If the servers that you want to manage have many different
usernames or passwords for the administrative accounts, you might want to
create an account on each server that has the same username and password.
For example, you might set up a common @code{multi_admin} account by
executing the following commands for each server:

@example
shell> mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -proot_password
mysql> GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.*
    -> TO 'multi_admin'@@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass';
@end example

@xref{Privileges}.
You will have to do this for each @code{mysqld} server. Change the
connection parameters appropriately when connecting to each one.  Note that
the host part of the account name must allow you to connect as
@code{multi_admin} from the host where you want to run @code{mysqld_multi}.

@item
The
@code{--pid-file} option is very important if you are using @code{mysqld_safe}
to start @code{mysqld} (for example, @code{--mysqld=mysqld_safe}) Every
@code{mysqld} should have its own process ID file. The advantage of
using @code{mysqld_safe} instead of @code{mysqld} is
that @code{mysqld_safe} ``guards'' its @code{mysqld} process and will
restart it if the process terminates due to a signal
sent using @code{kill -9}, or for other reasons such as a segmentation
fault. Please note that the
@code{mysqld_safe} script might require that you start it from a certain
place. This means that you might have to change location to a certain directory
before running @code{mysqld_multi}. If you have problems starting,
please see the @code{mysqld_safe} script. Check especially the lines:

@example
----------------------------------------------------------------
MY_PWD=`pwd`
# Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary release)
if test -d $MY_PWD/data/mysql -a -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys -a \
 -x ./bin/mysqld
----------------------------------------------------------------
@end example

@xref{mysqld_safe, , @code{mysqld_safe}}.
The test performed by these lines should be successful, or you might encounter
problems.

@item
The Unix socket file and the TCP/IP port must be different for every
@code{mysqld}.

@item
You might want to use the @code{--user} option for @code{mysqld}, but in order
to do this you need to run the @code{mysqld_multi} script as the Unix
@code{root} user. Having the option in the option file doesn't matter; you
will just get a warning, if you are not the superuser and the @code{mysqld}
processes are started under your own Unix account. @strong{Important}: Make
sure that the data directory is fully accessible to the Unix account that
the specific @code{mysqld} process is started as. @emph{Do not} use the
Unix root account for this, unless you @emph{know} what you are doing.

@item
@strong{Most important}: Before using @code{mysqld_multi} be sure that you
understand the meanings of the options that are passed to the @code{mysqld}
servers and @emph{why} you would want to have separate @code{mysqld}
processes.  Beware of the dangers of using multiple @code{mysqld} servers
with the same data directory.  Use separate data directories, unless you
@emph{know} what you are doing.  Starting multiple servers with the same
data directory @emph{will not} give you extra performance in a threaded
system.
@xref{Multiple servers}.


@end itemize

The following example shows how you might set up an option file for use with
@code{mysqld_multi}.  The first and fifth @code{[mysqld#]} group were
intentionally left out from the example to illustrate that you can have
``gaps'' in the option file. This gives you more flexibility.  The order in
which the @code{mysqld} programs are started or stopped depends on the order
in which they appear in the option file.

@example
# This file should probably be in your home dir (~/.my.cnf)
# or /etc/my.cnf
# Version 2.1 by Jani Tolonen

[mysqld_multi]
mysqld     = /usr/local/bin/mysqld_safe

@subsection @code{mysqld} Command-Line Options

@findex command-line options
@cindex options, command-line
@cindex mysqld options

When you start the @code{mysqld} server, you can specify program options
using any of the methods described in @ref{Program Options}. The most
common methods are to provide options in an option file or on the command
line. However, in most cases it is desirable to make sure that the server uses
the same options each time it runs. The best way to ensure this is to
list them in an option file.
@xref{Option files}.

@code{mysqld} reads options from the @code{[mysqld]} and @code{[server]}
groups.  @code{mysqld_safe} reads options from the @code{[mysqld]},
@code{[server]}, @code{[mysqld_safe]} and @code{[safe_mysqld]}
groups.  @code{mysql.server} reads options from the @code{[mysqld]}
and @code{[mysql.server]} groups.  An embedded MySQL server usually reads
options from the @code{[server]}, @code{[embedded]} and @code{[xxxxx_SERVER]}
groups, where @code{xxxxx} is the name of the application into which the
server is embedded.

@code{mysqld} accepts many command-line options.
For a list, execute @code{mysqld --help}. Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{--help}
prints the full help message. As of 4.1.1, it prints a brief message; to see
the full list, use @code{mysqld --verbose --help}.

The following list shows some of the most common server options.
Additional options are described elsewhere:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Options that affect security:
See @ref{Privileges options}.

@item
SSL-related options:
See @ref{SSL options}.

@item
Binary log control options:
See @ref{Binary log}.

@item
Replication-related options:
See @ref{Replication Options}.

@item
Options specific to particular storage engines:
See @ref{MyISAM start,  , @code{MyISAM} start},
@ref{BDB start,  , @code{BDB} start},
@ref{InnoDB start,  , @code{InnoDB} start}.

@end itemize

You can also set the value of a server system variable by using the variable
name as an option, as described later in this section.

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a short help message and exit.
Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{--help} displays the full help message.
As of 4.1.1, it displays an abbreviated message only.  Use both the
@code{--verbose} and @code{--help} options to see the full message.

@item --ansi
Use standard SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax.  @xref{ANSI mode}.
For more precise control over the server SQL mode, use the @code{--sql-mode}
option instead.

@item --basedir=path, -b path
The path to the MySQL installation directory. All paths are usually resolved
relative to this.

@item --big-tables
Allow large result sets by saving all temporary sets on file.  This option
prevents most ``table full'' errors, but also slows down queries for which
in-memory tables would suffice.  Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL is able to
handle large result sets automatically by using memory for small temporary
tables and switching to disk tables where necessary.

@item --bind-address=IP
The IP address to bind to.

@item --console
Write the error log messages to stderr/stdout even if @code{--log-error}
is specified.  On Windows, @code{mysqld} will not close the console screen if
this option is used.

@item --character-sets-dir=path
The directory where character sets are installed.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --chroot=path
Put the @code{mysqld} server in a closed environment during startup by using the
@code{chroot()} system call. This is a recommended security measure as of
MySQL 4.0. (MySQL 3.23 is not able to provide a @code{chroot()} jail that is
100% closed.)  Note that use of this option somewhat limits @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} and @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}.

@item --core-file
Write a core file if @code{mysqld} dies.  For some systems, you must also
specify the @code{--core-file-size} option to @code{mysqld_safe}.
@xref{mysqld_safe,  , @code{mysqld_safe}}.
Note that on some systems, such as Solaris, you will
not get a core file if you are also using the @code{--user} option.

@item --datadir=path, -h path
The path to the data directory.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
If MySQL is configured with @code{--with-debug}, you can use this
option to get a trace file of what @code{mysqld} is doing.
The @code{debug_options} string often is @code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.
@xref{Making trace files}.

@item --default-character-set=charset
Use @code{charset} as the default character set.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --default-collation=collation
Use @code{collation} as the default collation.
This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.
@xref{Character sets}.

@item --default-storage-engine=type
This option is a synonym for @code{--default-table-type}.
It is available as of MySQL 4.1.2.

@item --default-table-type=type
Set the default table type for tables.  @xref{Table types}.

@item --delay-key-write[= OFF | ON | ALL]
How the @code{DELAYED KEYS} option should be used.
Delayed key writing causes key buffers not to be flushed between writes for
@code{MyISAM} tables.
@code{OFF} disables delayed key writes.
@code{ON} enables delayed key writes for those tables that were created with
the @code{DELAYED KEYS} option.
@code{ALL} delays key writes for all @code{MyISAM} tables.
Available as of MySQL 4.0.3.
@xref{Server parameters}. @xref{MyISAM start}.

@strong{Note:} If you set this variable to ALL, you should not use
@code{MyISAM} tables from another program (like from another MySQL server or
with myisamchk) when the table is in use. Doing so, will lead to index
corruption.

@item --delay-key-write-for-all-tables
Old form of @code{--delay-key-write=ALL} for use prior to MySQL 4.0.3.
As of 4.0.3, use @code{--delay-key-write} instead.

@item --des-key-file=file_name
Read the default keys used by @code{DES_ENCRYPT()} and @code{DES_DECRYPT()}
from this file.

@item --enable-external-locking
Enable system locking.  Note that if you use this option on a system on
which @code{lockd} does not fully work (as on Linux), you will easily get
@code{mysqld} to deadlock.
This option previously was named @code{--enable-locking}.

@strong{Note:} If you use this option to enable updates to @code{MyISAM}
tables from many MySQL processes, you have to ensure that these conditions are
satisfied:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You should not use the query cache for queries that uses tables that are
updated by another process.
@item
You should not use @code{--delay-key-write=ALL} or @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1}
on any shared tables.
@end itemize

The easiest way to ensure this is to always use @code{--enable-locking}
together with @code{--delay-key-write=OFF --query-cache-size=0}.

(This is not done by default as in many setups it's useful to have a mixture
of the above options).

@item --enable-named-pipe
Enable support for named pipes.
This option applies only on Windows NT, 2000, and XP systems, and can be used
only with the @code{mysqld-nt} and @code{mysqld-max-nt} servers that support
named pipe connections.

@item --exit-info, -T
This is a bit mask of different flags you can use for debugging the
@code{mysqld} server. Do not use this option unless you know
exactly what it does!

@item --flush
Flush all changes to disk after each SQL statement.  Normally MySQL
only does a write of all changes to disk after each SQL statement and lets
the operating system handle the syncing to disk.
@xref{Crashing}.

@item --init-file=file
Read SQL statements from this file at startup.
Each statement must be on a single line and should not include comments.

@item --language=lang_name, -L lang_name
Client error messages in given language.  @code{lang_name} can be given as the
language name or as the full pathname to the directory where the language
files are installed.
@xref{Languages}.

@item --log[=file], -l [file]
Log connections and queries to this file. @xref{Query log}. If you don't
specify a file name, MySQL will use @code{hostname.log} as filename.

@item --log-bin=[file]
Log all queries that change data to this file. Used for backup and
replication.  @xref{Binary log}.  If you don't specify a file name,
MySQL will use @code{hostname-bin} as filename.

@item --log-bin-index[=file]
The index file for binary log file names. @xref{Binary log}.
If you don't specify file name, MySQL will use @code{hostname-bin.index} as
filename.

@item --log-error[=file]
Log errors and startup messages to this file. @xref{Error log}.
If you don't specify file name, MySQL will use @code{hostname.err} as filename.

@item --log-isam[=file]
Log all @code{ISAM}/@code{MyISAM} changes to this file (used only when
debugging @code{ISAM}/@code{MyISAM}).

@c UPDATE START
@item --log-long-format
Log some extra information to the log files (update log, binary update log,
and slow queries log, whatever log has been activated). For example, 
username and timestamp are logged for queries. If you are using 
@code{--log-slow-queries} and @code{--log-long-format}, then
queries that are not using indexes also are logged to the slow query log.
Note that @code{--log-long-format} is deprecated as of MySQL version
4.1, when @code{--log-short-format} was introduced (the long log format
is the default setting since version 4.1). Also note that starting with 
MySQL 4.1 the @code{--log-queries-not-using-indexes} option is available 
for the purpose of logging queries that do not use indexes to the slow 
queries log.
@c UPDATE STOP

@c INSERT START
@item --log-queries-not-using-indexes
If you are using this option with @code{--log-slow-queries}, then also 
queries that are not using indexes are logged to the slow query log. This 
option is available as of MySQL 4.1. @xref{Slow query log}.

@item --log-short-format
Log less information to the log files (update log, binary update log, 
and slow queries log, whatever log has been activated). For example, 
username and timestamp are not logged for queries. This options was 
introduced in MySQL 4.1.
@c INSERT STOP

@c UPDATE START
@item --log-slow-queries[=file]
Log all queries that have taken more than @code{long_query_time} seconds 
to execute to file. Note that the default for the amount of information 
logged has changed in MySQL 4.1. See the @code{--log-long-format} and 
@code{--log-long-format} options for details. @xref{Slow query log}.
@c UPDATE STOP

@item --log-update[=file]
Log updates to @code{file.#} where @code{#} is a unique number if not
given. @xref{Update log}. The update log is deprecated and is
removed in MySQL 5.0.0; you should use the binary log instead
(@code{--log-bin}). @xref{Binary log}. Starting from version 5.0.0,
using @code{--log-update} will just turn on the binary log instead
(@pxref{News-5.0.0}).

@item --log-warnings, -W
Print out warnings like @code{Aborted connection...} to the
@file{.err} file. Enabling this option is recommended, for example, if you
use replication (you will get more information about what is happening,
such as messages about network failures and reconnections).
This option is enabled by default as of MySQL 4.1.2; to disable it, use
@code{--skip-log-warnings}.
@xref{Communication errors}.

This option was named @code{--warnings} before MySQL 4.0.

@item --low-priority-updates
Table-modifying operations (@code{INSERT}/@code{DELETE}/@code{UPDATE})
will have lower priority than selects.  It can also be done via
@code{@{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE@} LOW_PRIORITY ...} to lower
the priority of only one query, or by
@code{SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1} to change the priority in one
thread.  @xref{Table locking}.

@item --memlock
Lock the @code{mysqld} process in memory.  This works on systems such as
Solaris that support the @code{mlockall()} system call.  This
might help if you have a problem where the operating system is causing
@code{mysqld} to swap on disk.
Note that use of this option requires that you run the server as @code{root},
which is normally not a good idea for security reasons.

@item --myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]]
Set the @code{MyISAM} storage engine recovery mode.
The option value is any combination of the values
of @code{DEFAULT}, @code{BACKUP}, @code{FORCE} or @code{QUICK}.
If you specify multiple values, seprate them by commas.
You can also use a value of @code{""} to disable this
option. If this option is used, @code{mysqld} will on open check if the
table is marked as crashed or if the table wasn't closed properly.
(The last option works only if you are running with
@code{--skip-external-locking}.)  If this is the case @code{mysqld} will run
check on the table. If the table was corrupted, @code{mysqld} will
attempt to repair it.

The following options affect how the repair works:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .7
@item @strong{Option} @tab @strong{Description}

@item @code{DEFAULT} @tab The same as not giving any option to
                    @code{--myisam-recover}.

@item @code{BACKUP} @tab If the data table was changed during recover, save a
                    backup of the @file{tbl_name.MYD} data file as
                    @file{tbl_name-datetime.BAK}.

@item @code{FORCE}  @tab Run recovery even if we will lose more than one row
                    from the @file{.MYD} file.

@item @code{QUICK}  @tab Don't check the rows in the table if there aren't any
                    delete blocks.

@end multitable

Before a table is automatically repaired, MySQL will add a note
about this in the error log.  If you want to be able to recover from most
problems without user intervention, you should use the options
@code{BACKUP,FORCE}.  This will force a repair of a table even if some rows
would be deleted, but it will keep the old data file as a backup so that
you can later examine what happened.

@item --new
From version 4.0.12, the @code{--new} option can be used to make the server
behave as 4.1 in certain respects, easing a 4.0 to 4.1 upgrade:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{TIMESTAMP} is returned as a string with the format
@code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'}.
@xref{Column types}.
@end itemize

This option can be used to help you see how your applications will behave in
MySQL 4.1, without actually upgrading to 4.1.

@item --pid-file=path
The path to the process ID file used by @code{mysqld_safe}.

@item --port=num, -P num
The port number to use when listening for TCP/IP connections.

@item --old-protocol, -o
Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility with some very old clients.
@xref{Upgrading-from-3.20}.

@item --one-thread
Only use one thread (for debugging under Linux).
This option is available only if the server is built with debugging enabled.
@xref{Debugging server}.

@item --open-files-limit=
To change the number of file descriptors available to @code{mysqld}.
If this is not set or set to 0, then @code{mysqld} will use this value
to reserve file descriptors to use with @code{setrlimit()}.  If this
value is 0 then @code{mysqld} will reserve @code{max_connections*5} or
@code{max_connections + table_cache*2} (whichever is larger) number of
files.  You should try increasing this if @code{mysqld} gives you the
error 'Too many open files'.

@item --safe-mode
Skip some optimize stages.

@item --safe-show-database
With this option, the @code{SHOW DATABASES} statement returns only those
databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
From version 4.0.2 this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(the option is enabled by default) as we now have the
@code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege. @xref{GRANT,  , @code{GRANT}}.

@item --safe-user-create
If this is enabled, a user can't create new users with the @code{GRANT}
statement, if the user doesn't have @code{INSERT} privilege to the
@code{mysql.user} table or any column in this table.

@item --skip-bdb
Disable the @code{BDB} storage engine. This saves memory and might speed
up some operations.
Do not use this operation if you require @code{BDB} tables.

@item --skip-concurrent-insert
Turn off the ability to select and insert at the same time on @code{MyISAM}
tables. (This is only to be used if you think you have found a bug in this
feature.)

@item --skip-delay-key-write
Ignore the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} option for all tables.
As of MySQL 4.0.3, you should use @code{--delay-key-write=OFF} instead.
@xref{Server parameters}.

@item --skip-external-locking
Don't use system locking.  To use @code{isamchk} or @code{myisamchk} you must
shut down the server.  @xref{Stability}.  Note that in MySQL Version
3.23, you can use @code{CHECK TABLE} and @code{REPAIR TABLE} to check and
repair @code{MyISAM} tables.
This option previously was named @code{--skip-locking}.

@item --skip-grant-tables
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all.  This
gives everyone @strong{full access} to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing a @code{mysqladmin
flush-privileges} or @code{mysqladmin reload} command, or by issuing a
@code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement.)

@item --skip-host-cache
Do not use the internal hostname cache for faster name-IP resolution. Instead,
query the DNS server every time a client connects.  @xref{DNS}.

@item --skip-innodb
Disable the @code{InnoDB} storage engine.  This saves memory and disk
space and might speed up some operations.
Do not use this operation if you require @code{InnoDB} tables.

@item --skip-isam
Disable the @code{ISAM} storage engine.  As of MySQL 4.1, @code{ISAM} is
disabled by default, so this option applies only if the server was configured
with support for @code{ISAM}.
This option was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item --skip-name-resolve
Do not resolve hostnames when checking client connections. Use only IP
numbers. If you use this option, all @code{Host} column values in the
grant tables must be IP numbers or @code{localhost}.  @xref{DNS}.

@item --skip-networking
Don't listen for TCP/IP connections at all.  All interaction with
@code{mysqld} must be made via named pipes (on Windows) or Unix socket files
(on Unix).  This option is highly recommended for systems where only local
clients are allowed.  @xref{DNS}.

@item --skip-new
Don't use new, possibly wrong routines.

@item --skip-symlink
This is the old form of @code{--skip-symbolic-links}, for use before MySQL
4.0.13.

@item --symbolic-links, --skip-symbolic-links
Enable or disable symbolic link support. This option has different effects on
Windows and Unix:

@itemize @bullet
@item
On Windows, enabling symbolic links allows you to establish a symbolic
link to a database directory by creating a
@code{directory.sym} file that contains the path to the real directory.
@xref{Windows symbolic links}.

@item
On Unix, enabling symbolic links means that you can link a
@code{MyISAM} index file or data file to another directory with
the @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} or @code{DATA DIRECTORY} options of the
@code{CREATE TABLE} statement.  If you delete or rename the table,
the files that its symbolic links point to also are deleted or
renamed. @xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.
@end itemize

This option was added in MySQL 4.0.13.

@item --skip-safemalloc
If MySQL is configured with @code{--with-debug=full}, all MySQL programs
checks for memory overruns during each memory allocation and memory
freeing operation.  This checking is very slow, so for the server you
can avoid it when you don't need it by using the @code{--skip-safemalloc}
option.

@item --skip-show-database
Don't allow the @code{SHOW DATABASES} statement, unless the user has the
@code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege.

@item --skip-stack-trace
Don't write stack traces.  This option is useful when you are running
@code{mysqld} under a debugger. On some systems, you also must use
this option to get a core file. @xref{Debugging server}.

@item --skip-thread-priority
Disable using thread priorities for faster response time.

@item --socket=path
@c Put the Unix description first, because the option name relates directly
@c to the Unix meaning. Putting the Windows meaning first makes this more
@c confusing.
On Unix, this option specifies the Unix socket file to
use for local connections. The default value is @file{/tmp/mysql.sock}.
On Windows, the option specifies the pipe name to use for local connections
that use a named pipe. The default value is @code{MySQL}.

@c TODO: some of these option values currently are unimplemented.
@c Need to say which ones.

@item --sql-mode=value[,value[,value...]]
Set the SQL mode for MySQL. @xref{SQL mode}. This option was added in 3.23.41.

@item --temp-pool
This option causes most temporary files created by the
server to use a small set of names, rather than a unique name for
each new file. This works around a problem in the Linux kernel
dealing with creating many
new files with different names. With the old behavior, Linux seems to
``leak'' memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache
rather than to the disk cache.

@item --transaction-isolation=level
Sets the default transaction isolation level, which can be
@code{READ-UNCOMMITTED},
@code{READ-COMMITTED},
@code{REPEATABLE-READ}, or
@code{SERIALIZABLE}.
@xref{SET TRANSACTION, , @code{SET TRANSACTION}}.

@item --tmpdir=path, -t path
The path of the directory to use for creating temporary files. It might be
useful if your default @code{/tmp} directory resides on a partition that
is too small to hold temporary tables.  Starting from MySQL 4.1, this
option accepts several paths that are used in round-robin fashion. Paths
should be separated by colon characters (@samp{:}) on Unix and semicolon
characters (@samp{;}) on Windows, NetWare, and OS/2.
If the MySQL server is acting as a replication slave, you should not set
@code{--tmpdir} to point to a directory on a memory-based filesystem or to a
directory that is cleared when the server host restarts.  A replication
slave needs some of its temporary files to survive a machine restart so that
it can replicate temporary tables or @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operations. If
files in the temporary file directory are lost when the server restarts,
replication will fail.

@item --user=@{user_name | user_id@}, -u @{user_name | user_id@}
Run the @code{mysqld} server as the user having the name @code{user_name} or
the numeric user ID @code{user_id}.
(``User'' in this context refers to a system login account, not a MySQL user
listed in the grant tables.)

This option is @strong{mandatory} when starting @code{mysqld} as @code{root}.
The server will change its user ID during its startup sequence, causing it
to run as that particular user rather than as @code{root}.
@xref{Security guidelines}.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.56 and 4.0.12:
To avoid a possible security hole where a user adds a @code{--user=root}
option to some @file{my.cnf} file (thus causing the server to run as
@code{root}), @code{mysqld} uses only the first
@code{--user} option specified and produces a warning if there are multiple
@code{--user} options. Options in @file{/etc/my.cnf} and
@file{datadir/my.cnf} are processed before
command-line options, so it is recommended that you
put a @code{--user} option in @file{/etc/my.cnf} and specify a value other than
@code{root}. The option in @file{/etc/my.cnf} will be found before any other
@code{--user} options, which ensures that the server runs as a user other
than @code{root}, and that a warning results if any other @code{--user} option
is found.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.
@end table

You can assign a value to a server system variables by using an option of
the form @code{--var_name=value}. For example, @code{--key_buffer_size=32M}
sets the @code{key_buffer_size} variable to a value of 32MB.

Note that when setting a variable to a value, MySQL might automatically
correct it to stay within a given range, or adjust the value to the
closest allowable value if only certain values are allowed.

It is also possible to set variables by using
@code{--set-variable=var_name=value} or @code{-O var_name=value}
syntax. However, this syntax is deprecated as of MySQL 4.0.

You can find a full description for all variables in @ref{Server system
variables}.  The section on tuning server parameters includes information
on how to optimize them.  @xref{Server parameters}.

You can change the values of most system variables for a running server with the
@code{SET} statement. @xref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET OPTION}}.

If you want to restrict the maximum value a startup option can be set to
with @code{SET}, you can define this by using the
@code{--maximum-var_name} command-line option.


@node Server SQL mode, Server system variables, Server options, Configuring MySQL
@subsection The Server SQL Mode

The MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, and (as of MySQL 4.1)
can apply these
modes differentially for different clients. This allows applications to
tailor server operation to their own requirements.

Modes define what SQL syntax MySQL should support and what kind of data
validation checks it should perform.  This makes it easier
to use MySQL in different environments and to use MySQL together
with other database servers.

You can set the default SQL mode by starting @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--sql-mode="modes"} option. Beginning with MySQL 4.1, you can also
change the mode after startup time by setting the @code{sql_mode} variable
with a @code{SET [SESSION|GLOBAL] sql_mode='modes'} statement.
Setting the @code{GLOBAL} variable affects the operation of all clients that
connect from that time on. Setting the @code{SESSION} variable affects only
the current client.
@code{modes} is a list of different modes separated by comma (@samp{,})
characters.
You can retrieve the current mode by issuing a @code{SELECT @@@@sql_mode}
statement. The default value is empty (no modes set).

The value also can be empty
(@code{--sql-mode=""}) if you want to reset it.

The following list describes the supported modes:

@table @code

@item ANSI_QUOTES
Treat @samp{"} as an identifier quote character (like the MySQL Server
@samp{`} quote character) and not as a string quote character. You can still
use @samp{`} to quote identifers in ANSI mode. With @code{ANSI_QUOTES}
enabled, you cannot use double quotes to quote a literal string, because it
will be intepreted as an identifier.
(New in MySQL 4.0.0.)

@item IGNORE_SPACE
Allow spaces between a function name and the @samp{(} character.  This forces
all function names to be treated as reserved words. As a result, if you want
to access any database, table, or column name that is a reserved word, you
must quote it.  For example, because there is a @code{USER()} function, the
name of the @code{user} table in the @code{mysql} database and the @code{User}
column in that table become reserved, so you must quote them:

@example
SELECT "User" FROM mysql."user";
@end example

(New in MySQL 4.0.0.)

@item NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO
@code{NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO} affects handling of @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
columns. Normally, you generate the next sequence number for the column by
inserting either @code{NULL} or @code{0} into it.
@code{NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO} suppresses this behavior for @code{0} so that
only @code{NULL} generates the next sequence number. This mode can be useful
if @code{0} has been stored in a table's @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column. (This
is not a recommended practice, by the way.)  For example, if you dump the
table with @code{mysqldump} and then reload it, normally MySQL generates
new sequence numbers when it encounters the @code{0} values, resulting in a
table with different contents than the one that was dumped. Enabling
@code{NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO} before reloading the dump file solves this
problem. (As of MySQL 4.1.1, @code{mysqldump} automatically includes
statements in the dump output to enable @code{NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO}.) (New
in MySQL 4.1.1.)

@item NO_DIR_IN_CREATE
When creating a table, ignore all @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} and @code{DATA
DIRECTORY} directives. This option is useful on slave replication servers.
(New in MySQL 4.0.15.)

@item NO_FIELD_OPTIONS
Don't print MySQL field-specific options in the output of @code{SHOW CREATE
TABLE}. This mode is used by @code{mysqldump} in portability mode.
(New in MySQL 4.1.1.)

@item NO_KEY_OPTIONS
Don't print MySQL index-specific options in the output of @code{SHOW CREATE
TABLE}. This mode is used by @code{mysqldump} in portability mode.
(New in MySQL 4.1.1.)

@item NO_TABLE_OPTIONS
Don't print MySQL table-specific options (such as @code{ENGINE}) in the
output of @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}. This mode is used by @code{mysqldump} in
portability mode.
(New in MySQL 4.1.1.)

@item NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION
In subtraction operations, don't mark the result as @code{UNSIGNED} if one
of the operands is unsigned. Note that this makes @code{UNSIGNED BIGINT} not
100% usable in all contexts. @xref{Cast Functions}.
(New in MySQL 4.0.2.)

@item ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
Don't allow queries which in the @code{GROUP BY} part refers to a not
selected column.
(New in MySQL 4.0.0.)

@item PIPES_AS_CONCAT
Treat @code{||} as a string concatenation operator (same as @code{CONCAT()})
rather than as a synonym for @code{OR}.
(New in MySQL 4.0.0.)

@item REAL_AS_FLOAT
Treat @code{REAL} as a synonym for @code{FLOAT} rather than as a synonym for
@code{DOUBLE}.
(New in MySQL 4.0.0.)

@end table

The following special modes are provided as shorthand for combinations of
mode values from the preceding list.
They are available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

* Dynamic System Variables::    Dynamic System Variables
@end menu


The server maintains many system variables that indicate how it is configured.
All of them have default values. They can be set at server startup
using options on the command line or in option
files. Most of them can be set at runtime using the
@code{SET} statement.

@c NOTE: next few paragraphs also appear in @node System Variables.
@c If you make changes one place, change them both.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.3,
the @code{mysqld} server maintains two kinds of variables.
Global variables affect the overall operation of the server.
Session variables affect its operation for individual client connections.

When the server starts, it initializes all global variables to their default
values. These defaults can be changed by options specified in option files
or on the command line.  After the server starts, those global variables
that are dynamic can be changed by connecting to the server and issuing
a @code{SET GLOBAL var_name} statement. To change a global variable,
you must have the @code{SUPER} privilege.

The server also maintains a set of session variables for each client
that connects. The client's session variables are initialized at connect
time using the current values of the corresponding global variables. For
those session variables that are dynamic, the client can change them
by issuing a @code{SET SESSION var_name} statement. Setting a session
variable requires no special privilege, but a client can change only its
own session variables, not those of any other client.

A change to a global variable is visible to any client that accesses that
global variable. However, it affects the corresponding session variable
that is intialized from the global variable only for clients that connect
after the change.  It does not affect the session variable for any client
that is already connected (not even that of the client that issues the
@code{SET GLOBAL} statement).

When setting a variable using a startup option, variable values can be given
with a suffix of @code{K}, @code{M}, or @code{G} to indicate kilobytes,
megabytes, or gigabytes. For example, the following command starts the server
with a key buffer size of 16 megabytes:

@example
mysqld --key_buffer_size=16M
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0, use this syntax instead:

@example
mysqld --set-variable=key_buffer_size=16M
@end example

The lettercase of suffix letters does not matter; @code{16M} and @code{16m} are
equivalent.

At runtime, use the @code{SET} statement to set system variables. In this
context, suffix letters cannot be used, but the value can take the form of an
expression:

@example
mysql> SET sort_buffer_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
@end example

To specify explicitly whether to set the global or session variable, use the
@code{GLOBAL} or @code{SESSION} options:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
mysql> SET SESSION sort_buffer_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
@end example

Without either option, the statement sets the session variable.

The variables that can be set at runtime are listed in
@ref{Dynamic System Variables}.

If you want to restrict the maximum value to which a system variable can
be set with the @code{SET} statement, you can specify this maximum at
startup by using an option of the form @code{--maximum-var_name} at server
startup. For example, to prevent the value of @code{query_cache_size}
from being increased to more than 32MB at runtime, use the option
@code{--maximum-query_cache_size=32M}. This feature is available as of MySQL
4.0.2.

You can view system variables and their values by using the
@code{SHOW VARIABLES} statement.  Many variables have both global and
session values. See @ref{System Variables} for more information.

@cindex variables, values

Most system variables are described here.  @code{InnoDB} system variables
are listed at
@ref{InnoDB start,  , @code{InnoDB} start}.

Values for buffer sizes, lengths, and stack sizes are given in bytes unless
otherwise specified.

Information on tuning these variables can be found in @ref{Server parameters}.

The system variables have the following meanings.  Variables with no
version indicated have been present since at least MySQL 3.22.

@table @code

@item ansi_mode
Is @code{ON} if @code{mysqld} was started with @code{--ansi}.
@xref{ANSI mode}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.6 and removed in 3.23.41.

@item back_log
The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have. This
comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets very
many connection requests in a very short time. It then takes some time
(although very little) for the main thread to check the connection and start
a new thread. The @code{back_log} value indicates how many requests can be
stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily stops
answering new requests. You need to increase this only if you expect a large
number of connections in a short period of time.

In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for incoming
TCP/IP connections.  Your operating system has its own limit on the size
of this queue.  The manual page for the Unix @code{listen(2)} system
call should have more details.  Check your OS documentation for the
maximum value for this variable.  Attempting to set @code{back_log}
higher than your operating system limit will be ineffective.

@item basedir
The MySQL installation base directory. This variable can be set with the
@code{--basedir} option.

@item bdb_cache_size
The size of the buffer that is allocated for caching indexes and rows for
@code{BDB} tables.  If you don't use @code{BDB} tables, you should start
@code{mysqld} with @code{--skip-bdb} to not waste memory for this cache.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.14.

@item bdb_home
The base directory for @code{BDB} tables.  This should be assigned the same
value as the @code{datadir} variable.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.14.

@item bdb_log_buffer_size
The size of the buffer that is allocated for caching indexes and rows for
@code{BDB} tables.  If you don't use @code{BDB} tables, you should set this
to 0 or start @code{mysqld} with @code{--skip-bdb} to not waste memory for
this cache.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.31.

@item bdb_logdir
The directory where the @code{BDB} storage engine writes its log files.
This variable can be set with the @code{--bdb-logdir} option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.14.

@item bdb_max_lock
The maximum number of locks you can have active on a @code{BDB} table
(10,000 by default). You should increase this if errors such as the
following occur when you perform long transactions or when @code{mysqld} has
to examine many rows to calculate a query:

@example
bdb: Lock table is out of available locks
Got error 12 from ...
@end example

This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.29.

@item bdb_shared_data
Is @code{ON} if you are using @code{--bdb-shared-data}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.29.

@item bdb_tmpdir
The value of the @code{--bdb-tmpdir} option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.14.

@item bdb_version
The BDB storage engine version.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.31.

@item binlog_cache_size
The size of the cache to hold the SQL statements for the binary log during
a transaction.  A binary log cache is allocated for each client if the
server supports any transactional storage engines and, starting from MySQL
4.1.2, if the server has binary log enabled (@code{log-bin} option). If you
often use big, multiple-statement transactions, you can increase this to get
more performance.
The @code{Binlog_cache_use} and @code{Binlog_cache_disk_use} status variables
can be useful for tuning the size of this variable.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.29.
@xref{Binary log}.

@item bulk_insert_buffer_size
@code{MyISAM} uses a special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts faster for
@code{INSERT ... SELECT}, @code{INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ...}, and
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE}. This variable limits
the size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. Setting it to 0
disables this optimization.
@strong{Note:} This cache is used only when adding data to a non-empty table.
The default value is 8MB.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.
This variable previously was named @code{myisam_bulk_insert_tree_size}.

@item character_set
The default character set.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.3, then
removed in MySQL 4.1.1 and replaced by the various
@code{character_set_xxx} variables.

@item character_set_client
The character set for statements that arrive from the client.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_set_connection
The character set used for literals that do not have a character set
introducer, for some functions, and for number-to-string conversion.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_set_database
The character set used by the default database.
The server sets this variable whenever the default database changes.
If there is no default database, the variable has the same value as
@code{character_set_server}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_set_results
The character set used for returning query results to the client.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_set_server
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_set_system
The character set used by the server for storing identifiers.
The value is always @code{utf8}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item character_sets
The supported character sets.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.15.

@item collation_connection
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item collation_database
The collation used by the default database.
The server sets this variable whenever the default database changes.
If there is no default database, the variable has the same value as
@code{collation_server}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item collation_server
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item concurrent_insert
If @code{ON} (the default), MySQL allows @code{INSERT} and @code{SELECT}
statements to run concurrently for @code{MyISAM} tables that have no free
blocks in the middle.  You can turn this option off by starting
@code{mysqld} with @code{--safe} or @code{--skip-new}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item connect_timeout
@cindex timeout
The number of seconds the @code{mysqld} server waits for a connect
packet before responding with @code{Bad handshake}.

@item datadir
The MySQL data directory. This variable can be set with the
@code{--datadir} option.

@item default_week_format
The default mode value to use for the @code{WEEK()} function.
This variable is available as of MySQL 4.0.14.

@item delay_key_write
This option applies only to @code{MyISAM} tables. It can have one of the
following values to affect handling of the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} table
option that can be given in @code{CREATE TABLE} statements.

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .75

@item @strong{Option} @tab @strong{Description}

@item @code{OFF} @tab @code{DELAYED_KEY_WRITE} is ignored.

@item @code{ON}  @tab MySQL honors the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} option
for @code{CREATE TABLE}. This is the default value.

@item @code{ALL} @tab All new opened tables are treated as if they were
created with the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} option enabled.

@end multitable

If @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} is enabled, this means that the key buffer for
tables with this option are not flushed on every index update, but
only when a table is closed.  This will speed up writes on keys a lot,
but if you use this feature, you should add automatic checking of all
@code{MyISAM} tables by starting the server with the @code{--myisam-recover}
option (for example, @code{--myisam-recover=BACKUP,FORCE}).
@xref{Server options}.  @xref{MyISAM start}.

Note that @code{--external-lock} doesn't offer any protection against
index corruption for tables that uses delayed key writes.

This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.8.

@item delayed_insert_limit
After inserting @code{delayed_insert_limit} delayed rows, the @code{INSERT
DELAYED} handler thread checks whether there are any @code{SELECT}
statements pending. If so, it allows them to execute before continuing to
insert delayed rows.

@item delayed_insert_timeout
How long an @code{INSERT DELAYED} handler thread should wait for
@code{INSERT} statements before terminating.

@item delayed_queue_size
How many rows to queue when handling @code{INSERT DELAYED}
statements.  If the queue becomes full, any client that issues an
@code{INSERT DELAYED} statement will wait until there is room in the queue
again.

@item flush
This is @code{ON} if you have started @code{mysqld} with the @code{--flush}
option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.9.

@item flush_time
If this is set to a non-zero value, all tables will be closed every
@code{flush_time} seconds to free up resources and sync unflushed data to
disk.  We recommend this option only on Windows 9x or Me, or on systems
with minimal resources available.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.18.

@item ft_boolean_syntax
The list of operators supported by boolean full-text searches performed using
@code{IN BOOLEAN MODE}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.1.
@xref{Fulltext Boolean}.

The default variable value is @code{'+ -><()~*:""&|'}. The rules for
changing the value are as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Operator function is determined by position within the string.

@item
The replacement value must be fourteen characters.

@item
Each character must be an ASCII non-alphanumeric character.

@item
Either the first or second character must be a space.

@item
No duplicates are allowed except the phrase quoting operators in positions
11 and 12. These two characters are not required to be the same, but they
are the only two that may be.

@item
Positions 10, 13, and 14 (which by default are set to @samp{:}, @samp{&}, and
@samp{|}) are reserved for future extensions.

@end itemize

@item ft_max_word_len
The maximum length of the word to be included in a @code{FULLTEXT} index.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.0.

@strong{Note:} @code{FULLTEXT} indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.

@item ft_min_word_len
The minimum length of the word to be included in a @code{FULLTEXT} index.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.0.

@strong{Note:} @code{FULLTEXT} indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.

@item ft_query_expansion_limit
The number of top matches to use for full-text searches performed using
@code{WITH QUERY EXPANSION}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item ft_stopword_file
The file from which to read the list of stopwords for full-text searches.
All the words from the file are used; comments are @strong{not} honored.
By default, a built-in list of stopwords is used (as defined in the
@file{myisam/ft_static.c} file).  Setting this variable to an empty string
(@code{''}) disables stopword filtering.  This variable was added in
MySQL 4.0.10.

@strong{Note:} @code{FULLTEXT} indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.

@item group_concat_max_len
The maximum allowed result length for the @code{GROUP_CONCAT()} function.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.0.

@item have_bdb
@code{YES} if @code{mysqld} supports @code{BDB} tables. @code{DISABLED}
if @code{--skip-bdb} is used.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.30.

@item have_innodb
@code{YES} if @code{mysqld} supports @code{InnoDB} tables. @code{DISABLED}
if @code{--skip-innodb} is used.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.37.

@item have_innodb
@code{YES} if @code{mysqld} supports @code{ISAM} tables. @code{DISABLED}
if @code{--skip-isam} is used.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.30.

@item have_raid
@code{YES} if @code{mysqld} supports the @code{RAID} option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.30.

@item have_openssl
@code{YES} if @code{mysqld} supports SSL (encryption) of the client/server
protocol.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.43.

@c TODO: it may be that init_connect/init_slave should be discussed in
@c a separate section that describes how to control client/slave startup.
@c Move the examples to such a section if it is written.

@item init_connect
A string to be executed by the server for each client that connects.
The string consists of one or more SQL statements. To specify multiple
statements, separate them by semicolon characters.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

For example, each client begins by default with autocommit mode enabled.
There is no global server variable to specify that autocommit should be
disabled by default, but @code{init_connect} can be used to achieve the
same effect:

@example
SET GLOBAL init_connect='SET AUTOCOMMIT=0';
@end example

This variable can also be set on the command line or in an option file.
To set the variable as just shown using an option file, include these
lines:

@example
[mysqld]
init_connect='SET AUTOCOMMIT=0'
@end example

@item init_file
The name of the file specified with the @code{--init-file} option when you
start the server.  This is a file containing SQL statements that you want
the server to execute when it starts.
Each statement must be on a single line and should not include comments.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.2.

@item init_slave
This variable is similar to @code{init_connect}, but is a string to be
executed by a slave server each time the SQL thread starts.  The format of
the string is the same as for the @code{init_connect} variable.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

@item innodb_xxx
The @code{InnoDB} system variables are listed at
@ref{InnoDB start,  , @code{InnoDB} start}.

@item interactive_timeout
The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an interactive
connection before closing it.  An interactive client is defined as a
client that uses the @code{CLIENT_INTERACTIVE} option to
@code{mysql_real_connect()}.  See also @code{wait_timeout}.

@item join_buffer_size
The size of the buffer that is used for full joins (joins that do not use
indexes).  Normally the best way to get fast joins is to add indexes.
Increase the value of @code{join_buffer_size} to get a faster full join when
adding indexes is not possible.  One join buffer is allocated for each full
join between two tables. For a complex join between several tables for which
indexes are not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary.

@c Make texi2html support index @anchor{Index cache size}. Then change
@c some xrefs to point here
@cindex indexes, block size

@item key_buffer_size
Index blocks for @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables are buffered and are
shared by all threads.  @code{key_buffer_size} is the size of the buffer
used for index blocks.  The key buffer is also known as the key cache.

Increase the value to get better index handling (for all reads and multiple
writes) to as much as you can afford. Using a value that is 25% of total
memory on a machine that mainly runs MySQL is quite common.  However, if you
make the value too large (for example, more than 50% of your total memory)
your system might start to page and become extremely slow. Remember that
MySQL relies on the operating system to perform filesystem caching for data
reads, so you must leave some room for the filesystem cache.

For even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use
@code{LOCK TABLES}.  @xref{LOCK TABLES, , @code{LOCK TABLES}}.

You can check the performance of the key buffer by issuing a @code{SHOW
STATUS} statement and examining the @code{Key_read_requests},
@code{Key_reads}, @code{Key_write_requests}, and @code{Key_writes} status
variables.
@xref{SHOW, , @code{SHOW}}.

The @code{Key_reads/Key_read_requests} ratio should normally be
less than 0.01.  The @code{Key_writes/Key_write_requests} ratio is usually
near 1 if you are using mostly updates and deletes, but might be much
smaller if you tend to do updates that affect many rows at the same time or
if you are using the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE} table option.

The fraction of the key buffer in use can be determined using
@code{key_buffer_size} in conjunction with the @code{Key_blocks_used} status
variable and the buffer blocksize.  From MySQL 4.1.1 on, the buffer block
size is available from the @code{key_cache_block_size} server variable. The
fraction of the buffer in use is:

@example
(Key_blocks_used * key_cache_block_size) / key_buffer_size
@end example

Before MySQL 4.1.1, key cache blocks are 1024 bytes, so the fraction of the
key buffer in use is:

@example
(Key_blocks_used * 1024) / key_buffer_size
@end example

@xref{MyISAM key cache,  , @code{MyISAM} key cache}.

@item key_cache_age_threshold
This value controls the demotion of buffers from the hot sub-chain of a key
cache to the warm sub-chain.
Lower values cause demotion to happen more quickly.
The minimum value is 100.
The default value is 300.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.
@xref{MyISAM key cache,  , @code{MyISAM} key cache}.

@item key_cache_block_size
The size in bytes of blocks in the key cache.
The default value is 1024.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.
@xref{MyISAM key cache,  , @code{MyISAM} key cache}.

@item key_cache_division_limit
The division point between the hot and warm sub-chains of the key cache
buffer chain. The value is the percentage of the buffer chain to use for
the warm sub-chain.  Allowable values range from 1 to 100.
The default value is 100.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.
@xref{MyISAM key cache,  , @code{MyISAM} key cache}.

@item language
The language used for error messages.

@item large_file_support
Whether @code{mysqld} was compiled with options for big file support.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.28.

@item local_infile
Whether @code{LOCAL} is supported for @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statements.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.

@item locked_in_memory
Whether @code{mysqld} was locked in memory with @code{--memlock}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.25.

@item log
Whether logging of all queries to the general query log is enabled.
@xref{Query log}.

@item log_bin
Whether the binary log is enabled.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.14.
@xref{Binary log}.

@item log_slave_updates
Whether updates received by a slave server from a master server should be
logged to the slave's own binary log. Binary logging must be enabled on the
slave for this to have any effect.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.17.
@xref{Replication Options}.

@item log_slow_queries
Whether slow queries should be logged.  ``Slow'' is determined by the value
of the @code{long_query_time} variable.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.2.
@xref{Slow query log}.

@item log_update
Whether the update log is enabled.  This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.18.
Note that the binary log is preferable to the update log, which
is unavailable as of MySQL 5.0.
@xref{Update log}.

@item long_query_time
If a query takes longer than this many seconds, the @code{Slow_queries} counter
is incremented. If you are using the @code{--log-slow-queries} option, the query
is logged to the slow query log file. This value is measured in real
time, not CPU time, so a query that is under the threshold on a lightly
loaded system might be above the threshold on a heavily loaded one.
@xref{Slow query log}.

@item low_priority_updates
If set to @code{1}, all @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}, and
@code{LOCK TABLE WRITE} statements wait until there is no pending
@code{SELECT} or @code{LOCK TABLE READ} on the affected table.
This variable previously was named @code{sql_low_priority_updates}.
It was added in MySQL 3.22.5.

@item lower_case_table_names
If set to 1, table names are stored in lowercase on disk and table name
comparisons are not case sensitive.  This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.6.
If set to 2 (new in 4.0.18), table names are stored as given but compared
in lowercase.  From MySQL 4.0.2, this option also applies to database names.
From 4.1.1, it also applies to table aliases.
@xref{Name case sensitivity}.

Note that you should @emph{not} set this variable to 0 if you are running
MySQL on a system that does not have case-sensitive filenames (such as
Windows or Mac OS X).  New in 4.0.18:  If this variable is 0 and the
filesystem on which the data directory is located does not have
case-sensitive filenames, MySQL automatically sets
@code{lower_case_table_names} to 2.

@item max_allowed_packet
The maximum size of one packet or any generated/intermediate string.

The packet message buffer is initialized to @code{net_buffer_length}
bytes, but can grow up to @code{max_allowed_packet} bytes when needed.
This value by default is small, to catch big (possibly wrong) packets.

You must increase this value if you are using big @code{BLOB} columns or
long strings. It should be as big as the biggest @code{BLOB} you want to
use.  The protocol limit for @code{max_allowed_packet} is 16MB before
MySQL 4.0 and 1GB thereafter.

@item max_binlog_cache_size
If a multiple-statement transaction requires more than this amount of memory,
you will get the error @code{Multi-statement transaction required more than
'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.29.

@item max_binlog_size
If a write to the binary log exceeds the given value, rotate the binary
logs.  You cannot set this variable to more than 1GB or to less than 4096
bytes.  (The minimum before MYSQL 4.0.14 is 1024 bytes.) The default value
is 1GB.  This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.33.

Note if you are using transactions: A transaction is written in one chunk to
the binary log, hence it is never split between several binary logs.
Therefore, if you have big transactions, you might see binary logs bigger than
@code{max_binlog_size}.

If @code{max_relay_log_size} is 0, the value of @code{max_binlog_size}
applies to relay logs as well. @code{max_relay_log_size} was added in
MySQL 4.0.14.

@item max_connect_errors
If there are more than this number of interrupted connections from a host,
that host is blocked from further connections.  You can unblock blocked hosts
with the @code{FLUSH HOSTS} statement.

@item max_connections
The number of simultaneous client connections allowed. Increasing this value
increases the number of file descriptors that @code{mysqld} requires.  See
@ref{Table cache} for comments on file descriptor limits.
@xref{Too many connections}.

@item max_delayed_threads
Don't start more than this number of threads to handle @code{INSERT DELAYED}
statements.  If you try to insert data into a new table after all @code{INSERT
DELAYED} threads are in use, the row will be inserted as if the
@code{DELAYED} attribute wasn't specified. If you set this to 0, MySQL
never creates a thread to handle @code{DELAYED} rows; in effect, this
disables @code{DELAYED} entirely.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.0.

@item max_error_count
The maximum number of error, warning, and note messages to be stored for
display by @code{SHOW ERRORS} or @code{SHOW WARNINGS}.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.0.

@item max_heap_table_size
This variable sets the maximum size to which @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP})
tables are allowed to grow.  The value of the variable is used to calculate
@code{MEMORY} table @code{MAX_ROWS} values.  Setting this variable has no
effect on any existing @code{MEMORY} table, unless the table is re-created
with a statement such as @code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{TRUNCATE TABLE}, or
altered with @code{ALTER TABLE}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.0.

@item max_insert_delayed_threads
This variable is a synonym for @code{max_delayed_threads}.
It was added in MySQL 4.0.19.

@item max_join_size
Don't allow @code{SELECT} statements that probably will need to examine
more than @code{max_join_size} row combinations or are likely to do more
than @code{max_join_size} disk seeks.  By setting this value, you can catch
@code{SELECT} statements where keys are not used properly and that would
probably take a long time.  Set it if your users tend to perform joins
that lack a @code{WHERE} clause, that take a long time, or that return
millions of rows.

Setting this variable to a value other than @code{DEFAULT} resets
the @code{SQL_BIG_SELECTS} value to @code{0}.  If you set the
@code{SQL_BIG_SELECTS} value again, the @code{max_join_size} variable
is ignored.

If a query result already is in the query cache, no result size
check is performed, because the result has already been computed and it will
not burden the server to send it to the client.

This variable previously was named @code{sql_max_join_size}.

@item max_relay_log_size
If a write by a replication slave to its relay log exceeds the given value,
rotate the relay log.  This variable enables you to put different size
constraints on relay logs and binary logs.  However, setting the variable to
0 makes MySQL use @code{max_binlog_size} for both binary logs and relay
logs.  You must set @code{max_relay_log_size} to between 4096 bytes and 1GB
(inclusive), or to 0. The default value is 0.  This variable was added in
MySQL 4.0.14.
@xref{Replication Implementation Details}.

@item max_seeks_for_key
Limit the assumed maximum number of seeks when looking up rows based on a
key.  The MySQL optimizer will assume that no more than this number of key
seeks will be required when searching for matching rows in a table by
scanning a key, regardless of the actual cardinality of the key.  By setting
this to a low value (100?), you can force MySQL to prefer keys instead of
table scans.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.14.

@item max_sort_length
The number of bytes to use when sorting @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT}
values. Only the first @code{max_sort_length} bytes of each value
are used; the rest are ignored.

@item max_tmp_tables
(This option doesn't yet do anything.)
The maximum number of temporary tables a client can keep open at the same time.

@item max_user_connections
The maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed to any given MySQL
account.  A value of 0 means ``no limit.''
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.34.

@item max_write_lock_count
After this many write locks, allow some read locks to run in between.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item myisam_data_pointer_size
Default pointer size in bytes to be used by @code{CREATE TABLE} for
@code{MyISAM} tables when no @code{MAX_ROWS} option is specified.  This
variable cannot be less than 2 or larger than 8.  The default value is 4.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.2.
@xref{Full table, @code{myisam_data_pointer_size}}.

@item myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size
If the temporary file used for fast @code{MyISAM} index creation would be
larger than using the key cache by the amount specified here, prefer the key
cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in large
tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.37.
@strong{Note:} The value is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes thereafter.

@item myisam_max_sort_file_size
The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while
re-creating a @code{MyISAM} index (during @code{REPAIR TABLE}, @code{ALTER
TABLE} or @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}).  If the file size would be bigger than
this value, the index will be created using the key cache instead, which is
slower.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.37.
@strong{Note:} The value is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes thereafter.

@item myisam_recover_options
The value of the @code{--myisam-recover} option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.36.

@item myisam_repair_threads
If this value is greater than 1, @code{MyISAM} table indexes are created in
parallel (each index in its own thread) during the @code{Repair by sorting}
process.  The default value is 1.  @strong{Note:} Multi-threaded repair is
still @emph{alpha} quality code.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.13.

@item myisam_sort_buffer_size
The buffer that is allocated when sorting @code{MyISAM} indexes during a
@code{REPAIR TABLE} or when creating indexes with @code{CREATE INDEX} or
@code{ALTER TABLE}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.16.

@item named_pipe
On Windows, indicates whether the server supports connections over named
pipes.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.50.

@item net_buffer_length
The communication buffer is reset to this size between queries. This should
not normally be changed, but if you have very little memory, you can set it
to the expected length of SQL statements sent by clients.  If statements
exceed this length, the buffer is automatically enlarged, up to
@code{max_allowed_packet} bytes.

@item net_read_timeout
The number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before
aborting the read.
When the server is reading from the client, @code{net_read_timeout} is the
timeout value controlling when to abort.
When the server is writing to the client, @code{net_write_timeout} is the
timeout value controlling when to abort.
See also @code{slave_net_timeout}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.20.

@item net_retry_count
If a read on a communication port is interrupted, retry this many times
before giving up.  This value should be set quite high on FreeBSD because
internal interrupts are sent to all threads.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item net_write_timeout
The number of seconds to wait for a block to be written to a connection before
aborting the write.
See also @code{net_read_timeout}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.20.

@item open_files_limit
The number of files the operating system allows @code{mysqld} to open.  This
is the real value allowed by the system and might be different from the value
you gave @code{mysqld} as a startup option.  The value is 0 on systems where
MySQL can't change the number of open files.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.20.

@item pid_file
The pathname of the process ID (PID) file. This variable can be set
with the @code{--pid-file} option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.23.

@item port
The port on which the server listens for TCP/IP connections.  This variable
can be set with the @code{--port} option.

@item protocol_version
The version of the client/server protocol used by the MySQL server.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.18.

@item query_alloc_block_size
The allocation size of memory blocks that are allocated for objects created
during query parsing and execution. If you have problems with memory
fragmentation, it might help to increase this a bit.  This variable was added
in MySQL 4.0.16.

@item query_cache_limit
Don't cache results that are bigger than this. The default value is 1MB.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.1.

@item query_cache_min_res_unit
The minimum size for blocks allocated by the query cache.
The default value is 4KB. Tuning information for this variable
is given in @ref{Query Cache Configuration}.
This variable is present from MySQL 4.1.

@item query_cache_size
The amount of memory allocated for caching query results.  The default value
is 0, which disables the query cache.  Note that this amount of memory will
be allocated even if @code{query_cache_type} is set to 0.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.1.

@item query_cache_type
Set query cache type. Setting the @code{GLOBAL} value sets the type for all
clients that connect thereafter. Individual clients can set the
@code{SESSION} value to affect their own use of the query cache.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .70

@item @strong{Option} @tab @strong{Description}

@item @code{0} or @code{OFF} @tab Don't cache or retrieve results.
Note that this will not deallocate the query cache buffer. To
do that, you should set @code{query_cache_size} to 0.

@item @code{1} or @code{ON} @tab Cache all query results except for those that
begin with @code{SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE}.

@item @code{2} or @code{DEMAND} @tab Cache results only for queries that
begin with @code{SELECT SQL_CACHE}.

@end multitable

This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.

@item query_cache_wlock_invalidate
Normally, when one client acquires a @code{WRITE} lock on a @code{MyISAM}
table, other clients are not blocked from issuing queries for the table if
the query results are present in the query cache. Setting this variable to
1 causes acquisition of a @code{WRITE} lock for a table to invalidate
any queries in the query cache that refer to the table. This forces other
clients that attempt to access the table to wait while the lock is in effect.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.19.

@item query_prealloc_size
The size of the persistent buffer used for query parsing and execution.
This buffer is not freed between queries.
If you are running complex queries, a larger @code{query_prealloc_size} value
might be helpful in improving performance, because it can reduce the need for
the server to perform memory allocation during query execution operations.
@c It won't necessarily eliminate allocation completely; server *may* still
@c allocate memory in some situations, e.g., transaction-related or sp-related
@c ops.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.16.

@item range_alloc_block_size
The size of blocks that are allocated when doing range optimization.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.16.

@item read_buffer_size
Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this
size for each table it scans. If you do many sequential scans, you might
want to increase this value.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.
Previously, it was named @code{record_buffer}.

@item read_only
When the variable is set to @code{ON} for a replication slave server, it
causes the slave to allow no updates except from slave threads or from users
with the @code{SUPER} privilege.  This can be useful to ensure that a slave
server accepts no updates from clients.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.14.

@item read_rnd_buffer_size
When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read through
this buffer to avoid disk seeks.  Setting the variable to a large value can
improve @code{ORDER BY} performance by a lot.  However, this is a buffer
allocated for each client, so you should not set the global variable to a
large value. Instead, change the session variable only from within those
clients that need to run large queries.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.
Previously, it was named @code{record_rnd_buffer}.

@item safe_show_database
Don't show databases for which the user has no database or
table privileges. This can improve security if you're concerned about
people being able to see what databases other users have. See also
@code{skip_show_database}.

This variable was removed in MySQL 4.0.5. Instead, use the @code{SHOW
DATABASES} privilege to control access by MySQL accounts to database names.

@item secure_auth
If the MySQL server has been started with the @code{--secure-auth} option,
it blocks connections from all accounts that have passwords stored in the old 
(pre-4.1) format. In that case, the value of this variable is @code{ON}, 
otherwise it is @code{OFF}.

You should enable this option if you want to prevent all usage of passwords
in old format (and hence insecure communication over the network).
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

Note that server startup will fail with an error if this option is enabled
and the privilege tables are in pre-4.1 format.

@c TODO: this doesn't really belong here in a discussion of server variables

When used as a client-side option, the client refuses to connect to a server
if the server requires a password in old format for the client account.

@item server_id
The value of the @code{--server-id} option. It is used for master and slave
replication servers.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.26.

@item skip_external_locking
Is @code{OFF} if @code{mysqld} uses external locking.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.
Previously, it was named @code{skip_locking}.

@item skip_networking
Is @code{ON} if we allow only local (non-TCP/IP) connections.  On Unix,
local connections use a Unix socket file.  On Windows, local connections use
a named pipe.  On NetWare, only TCP/IP connections are supported, so do not
set this variable to @code{ON}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.23.

@item skip_show_database
This prevents people from using the @code{SHOW DATABASES} statement if they
don't have the @code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege. This can improve security if
you're concerned about people being able to see what databases other users
have. See also @code{safe_show_database}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.4.

@item slave_net_timeout
The number of seconds to wait for more data from a master/slave connection
before aborting the read.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.40.

@item slow_launch_time
If creating a thread takes longer than this many seconds, the server
increments the @code{Slow_launch_threads} status variable.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.15.

@item socket
On Unix, this is the Unix socket file used for local client connections.  On
Windows, this is the name of the named pipe used for local client
connections.

@item sort_buffer_size
Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this
size. Increase this value for faster @code{ORDER BY} or @code{GROUP BY}
operations.
@xref{Temporary files}.

@item sql_mode
The current server SQL mode.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.41.
@xref{SQL mode}.

@item storage_engine
This variable is a synonym for @code{table_type}.
It was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

@item table_cache
The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
increases the number of file descriptors that @code{mysqld} requires.
You can check whether you need to increase the table cache by checking the
@code{Opened_tables} status variable.
@xref{Server status variables}.
If the value of @code{Opened_tables} is large and you don't do @code{FLUSH
TABLES} a lot (which just forces all tables to be closed and reopenend),
then you should increase the value of the @code{table_cache} variable.

For more information about the table cache, see @ref{Table cache}.

@item table_type
The default table type (storage engine).
To set the table type at server startup, use the @code{--default-table-type}
option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.0.
@xref{Server options}.

@item thread_cache_size
How many threads the server should cache for reuse.  When a client
disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't
already @code{thread_cache_size} threads there.  Requests for threads are
satsified by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when
the cache is empty is a new thread created.  This variable can be increased
to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections. (Normally this
doesn't give a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread
implementation.)  By examing the difference between the @code{Connections}
and @code{Threads_created} status variables (@pxref{Server status variables}
for details) you can see how efficient the thread cache is.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.16.

@item thread_concurrency
On Solaris, @code{mysqld} calls @code{thr_setconcurrency()} with this value.
This function allows applications to give the threads system a hint about
the desired number of threads that should be run at the same time.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item thread_stack
The stack size for each thread.  Many of the limits detected by the
@code{crash-me} test are dependent on this value. The default is
large enough for normal operation.  @xref{MySQL Benchmarks}.

@item timezone
The time zone for the server.  This is set from the @code{TZ} environment
variable when @code{mysqld} is started.  The time zone also can be set by
giving a @code{--timezone} argument to @code{mysqld_safe}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.15.
@xref{Timezone problems}.

@item tmp_table_size
If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL
automatically converts it to an on-disk @code{MyISAM} table.
Increase the value of @code{tmp_table_size} if you do many advanced
@code{GROUP BY} queries and you have lots of memory.

@item tmpdir
The directory used for temporary files and temporary tables.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, this variable can be set to a list of
several paths that are used in round-robin fashion. Paths
should be separated by colon characters (@samp{:}) on Unix and semicolon
characters (@samp{;}) on Windows, NetWare, and OS/2.

This feature can be used to
spread load between several physical disks.
If the MySQL server is acting as a replication slave, you should not set
@code{tmpdir} to point to a directory on a memory-based filesystem or to a
directory that is cleared when the server host restarts.  A replication
slave needs some of its temporary files to survive a machine restart so that
it can replicate temporary tables or @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operations. If
files in the temporary file directory are lost when the server restarts,
replication will fail.

This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.4.

@item transaction_alloc_block_size
The allocation size of memory blocks that are allocated for storing queries
that are part of a transaction to be stored in the binary log when doing a
commit.  This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.16.

@item transaction_prealloc_size
The size of the persistent buffer for @code{transaction_alloc_blocks} that
is not freed between queries. By making this big enough to fit all queries
in a common transaction, you can avoid a lot of @code{malloc()} calls.  This
variable was added in MySQL 4.0.16.

@item tx_isolation
The default transaction isolation level.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.3.

@item version
The version number for the server.

@item wait_timeout
The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a non-interactive
connection before closing it.

On thread startup, the session @code{wait_timeout} value is initialized from
the global @code{wait_timeout} value or from the global
@code{interactive_timeout} value, depending on the type of client (as
defined by the @code{CLIENT_INTERACTIVE} connect option to
@code{mysql_real_connect()}). See also @code{interactive_timeout}.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.3, many server system variables are dynamic and can
be set at runtime using @code{SET GLOBAL} or @code{SET SESSION}. You can also
select their values using @code{SELECT}.

The following table shows the full list of all dynamic system variables.
The last column indicates for each variable whether @code{GLOBAL} or

Variables that are marked as ``string'' take a string value.  Variables that
are marked as ``numeric'' take a numeric value. Variables that are
marked as ``boolean' can be set to 0, 1, @code{ON} or @code{OFF}. Variables
that are marked as ``enumeration'' normally should be set to one of the
available values for the variable, but can also be set to the number that
corresponds to the desired enumeration value.  For enumeration-valued system
variables, the The first enumeration value corresponds to 0. This differs
from @code{ENUM} columns, for which the first enumeration value corresponds
to 1.

@end example

Many status variables are reset to 0 by the @code{FLUSH STATUS} statement.

The status variables have the following meanings.  The @code{Com_xxx}
statement counter variable were added beginning with MySQL 3.23.47. The
@code{Qcache_xxx} query cache variables were added beginning with MySQL
4.0.1. Otherwise, variables with no version indicated have been present since
at least MySQL 3.22.

@table @code

@item Aborted_clients
The number of connections that were aborted because the client died without
closing the connection properly.
@xref{Communication errors}.

@item Aborted_connects
The number of tries to connect to the MySQL server that failed. @xref{Communication errors}.

@item Binlog_cache_use
The number of transactions that used the temporary binary log cache.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

@item Binlog_cache_disk_use
The number of transactions that used the temporary binary log cache but that
exceeded the value of @code{binlog_cache_size} and used a temporary file to
store statements from the transaction.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

@item Bytes_received
The number of bytes received from all clients.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item Bytes_sent
The number of bytes sent to all clients.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.7.

@item Com_xxx
The number of times each @code{xxx} statement has been executed.
There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example,
@code{Com_delete} and @code{Com_insert} count @code{DELETE} and @code{INSERT}
statements.

@item Connections
The number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server.

@item Created_tmp_disk_tables
The number of temporary tables on disk created automatically
by the server while executing statements.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.24.

@item Created_tmp_files
How many temporary files @code{mysqld} has created.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.28.

@item Created_tmp_tables
The number of in-memory temporary tables created automatically by the
server while executing statements.
If @code{Created_tmp_disk_tables} is big, you may want to increase the
@code{tmp_table_size} value to cause temporary tables to be memory-based
instead of disk-based.

@item Delayed_errors
The number of rows written with @code{INSERT DELAYED} for which some error
occurred (probably @code{duplicate key}).

@item Delayed_insert_threads
The number of @code{INSERT DELAYED} handler threads in use.

@item Delayed_writes
The number of @code{INSERT DELAYED} rows written.

@item Flush_commands
The number of executed @code{FLUSH} statements.

@item Handler_commit
The number of internal @code{COMMIT} statements.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.2.

@item Handler_delete
The number of times a row was deleted from a table.

@item Handler_read_first
The number of times the first entry was read from an index.
If this is high, it suggests that the server is doing a lot of full index scans, for example,
@code{SELECT col1 FROM foo}, assuming that @code{col1} is indexed.

@item Handler_read_key
The number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this
is high, it is a good indication that your queries and tables are properly indexed.

@item Handler_read_next
The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This will be
incremented if you are querying an index column with a range constraint or
if you are doing an index scan.

@item Handler_read_prev
The number of requests to read the previous row in key order.  This read
method is mainly used to optimize @code{ORDER BY ... DESC}.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.6.

@item Handler_read_rnd
The number of requests to read a row based on a fixed position.  This will
be high if you are doing a lot of queries that require sorting of the
result.
You probably have a lot of queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables
or you have joins that don't use keys properly.

@item Handler_read_rnd_next
The number of requests to read the next row in the data file.
This will be high if you are doing a lot of table scans. Generally this suggests that your tables
are not properly indexed or that your queries are not written to take advantage of the indexes you
have.

@item Handler_rollback
The number of internal @code{ROLLBACK} statements.
This variable was added in MySQL 4.0.2.

@item Handler_update
The number of requests to update a row in a table.

@item Handler_write
The number of requests to insert a row in a table.

@item Key_blocks_used
The number of used blocks in the key cache.
You can use this value to determine how much of the key cache is in use;
see the discussion of @code{key_buffer_size} in
@ref{Server system variables}.

@item Key_read_requests
The number of requests to read a key block from the cache.

@item Key_reads
The number of physical reads of a key block from disk.
If @code{Key_reads} is big, then your @code{key_buffer_size} value is
probably too small.  The @strong{cache miss rate} can be calculated with
@code{Key_reads}/@code{Key_read_requests}.

@item Key_write_requests
The number of requests to write a key block to the cache.

@item Key_writes
The number of physical writes of a key block to disk.

@item Max_used_connections
The maximum number of connections that have been in use simultaneously since
the server started

@item Not_flushed_delayed_rows
The number of rows waiting to be written in @code{INSERT DELAY} queues.

@item Not_flushed_key_blocks
The number of key blocks in the key cache that have changed but haven't yet
been flushed to disk.

@item Open_files
The number of files that are open.

@item Open_streams
The number of streams that are open (used mainly for logging).

@item Open_tables
The number of tables that are open.

@item Opened_tables

@subsection General Security Guidelines

Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet
should read this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

In discussing security, we emphasize the necessity of fully protecting the
entire server host (not just the MySQL server) against all types
of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering, playback, and denial of
service. We do not cover all aspects of availability and fault tolerance
here.

MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that users can attempt to
perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts
discussed here are not specific to MySQL at all; the same
general ideas apply to almost all applications.

When running MySQL, follow these guidelines whenever possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Do not ever give anyone (except MySQL @code{root} accounts) access
to the @code{user} table in the @code{mysql} database!}  This is critical.
@strong{The encrypted password is the real password in MySQL.} Anyone who
knows the password which is listed in the @code{user} table and has access
to the host listed for the account @strong{can easily log in as that user}.

@item
Learn the MySQL access privilege system. The @code{GRANT} and
@code{REVOKE} statements are used for controlling access to MySQL. Do
not grant any more privileges than necessary. Never grant privileges to all
hosts.

Checklist:
@itemize @minus
@item
Try @code{mysql -u root}. If you are able to connect successfully to the
server without being asked for a password, you have problems. Anyone
can connect to your MySQL server as the MySQL
@code{root} user with full privileges!
Review the MySQL installation instructions, paying particular
attention to the item about setting a @code{root} password.
@item
Use the @code{SHOW GRANTS} statement and check to see who has access to
what.  Then use the @code{REVOKE} statement to remove those privileges that
are not necessary.
@end itemize

@item
Do not store any plain-text passwords in your database. If your
computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list of
passwords and use them. Instead, use @code{MD5()}, @code{SHA1()} or
some other one-way hashing function.
@item
Do not choose passwords from dictionaries. There are special programs to
break them. Even passwords like ``xfish98'' are very bad.  Much better is
``duag98'' which contains the same word ``fish'' but typed one key to the
left on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Another method is to use ``Mhall'' which
is taken from the first characters of each word in the sentence ``Mary had
a little lamb.'' This is easy to remember and type, but difficult to guess
for someone who does not know it.
@item
Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of all types of
exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the firewall or in
a demilitarized zone (DMZ).

Checklist:
@itemize @minus
@item
Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such as
@code{nmap}. MySQL uses port 3306 by default. This port should
not be accessible from untrusted hosts. Another simple way to check whether
or not your MySQL port is open is to try the following command
from some remote machine, where @code{server_host} is the host where
your MySQL server runs:

@example
shell> telnet server_host 3306
@end example

If you get a connection and some garbage characters, the port is
open, and should be closed on your firewall or router, unless you really
have a good reason to keep it open. If @code{telnet} just hangs or the
connection is refused, everything is OK; the port is blocked.
@end itemize

@item
Do not trust any data entered by users of your applications. They can try to trick your
code by entering special or escaped character sequences in Web forms,
URLs, or whatever application you have built. Be sure that your
application remains secure if a user enters something like ``@code{; DROP
DATABASE mysql;}''. This is an extreme example, but large security leaks
and data loss might occur as a result of hackers using similar techniques,
if you do not prepare for them.

A common mistake is to protect only string data values.  Remember to check
numeric data as well.  If an application generates a query such as
@code{SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234} when a user enters the value
@code{234}, the user can enter the value @code{234 OR 1=1} to cause the
application to generate the query @code{SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234 OR
1=1}.  As a result, the server retrieves every record in the table.  This
exposes every record and causes excessive server load.  The simplest way to
protect from this type of attack is to use apostrophes around the numeric
constants: @code{SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID='234'}. If the user enters
extra information, it all becomes part of the string. In numeric context,
MySQL automatically converts this string to a number and strips any trailing
non-numeric characters from it.

Sometimes people think that if a database contains only publicly available
data, it need not be protected. This is incorrect.  Even if it is allowable
to display any record in the database, you should still protect against
denial of service attacks (for example, those that are based on the
technique in the preceding paragraph that causes the server to waste
resources). Otherwise, your server becomes unresponsive to legitimate users.

Checklist:
@itemize @minus
@item
Try to enter @samp{'} and @samp{"} in all your Web forms. If you get any kind
of MySQL error, investigate the problem right away.
@item
Try to modify any dynamic URLs by adding @code{%22} (@samp{"}), @code{%23}
(@samp{#}), and @code{%27} (@samp{'}) in the URL.
@item
Try to modify data types in dynamic URLs from numeric ones to character
ones containing characters from previous examples. Your application
should be safe against this and similar attacks.
@item
Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols rather than numbers in
numeric fields. Your application should remove them before passing them to
MySQL or else generate an error. Passing
unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous!
@item
Check data sizes before passing them to MySQL.
@item
Consider having your application connect to the database using a
different username than the one you use for administrative purposes. Do
not give your applications any access privileges they do not need.
@end itemize
@item
Many application programming interfaces provide the means of escaping special
characters in data values. Properly used, this prevents application users from
entering values that cause the application to generate statements that have a
different effect than you intend:
@itemize @minus
@item
Users of PHP:
Use the @code{mysql_escape_string()} function, which
is based on the function of the same name in the MySQL C API.
Prior to PHP 4.0.3, use  @code{addslashes()} instead.
@item
Users of MySQL C API:
Use the @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} API call.
@item
Users of MySQL++:
Use the @code{escape} and @code{quote} modifiers for query streams.
@item
Users of Perl DBI:
Use the @code{quote()} method or use placeholders.
@item
Users of Java JDBC:
Use a @code{PreparedStatement} object and placeholders.
@end itemize

Other programming interfaces might have similar capabilities.

@item
Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet. This information is
accessible to everyone who has the time and ability to intercept it and use
it for their own purposes. Instead, use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or
SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL connections as of Version 4.0.0.
SSH port-forwarding can be used to create an encrypted (and compressed)
tunnel for the communication.
@item
Learn to use the @code{tcpdump} and @code{strings} utilities. For most cases,
you can check whether MySQL data streams are unencrypted
by issuing a command like the following:

@example
shell> tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
@end example

(This works under Linux and should work with small modifications under other
systems.)  Warning: If you do not see plaintext data, this doesn't always
mean that the information actually is encrypted. If you need high security,
you should consult with a security expert.

@subsection Making MySQL Secure Against Attackers

@cindex attackers, security against
@cindex security, against attackers

When you connect to a MySQL server, you should use a password.  The password
is not transmitted in clear text over the connection. Password handling during
the client connection sequence was upgraded in MySQL 4.1.1 to be very secure.
If you are using an older version of MySQL, or are still using pre-4.1.1-style
passwords, the encryption
algorithm is less strong and with some effort a clever attacker that can
sniff the traffic between the client and the server can crack the password.
(See @ref{Password hashing} for a discussion of the different password handling
methods.)
If the connection between the client and the server goes through an
untrusted network, you should use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the communication.

All other information is transferred as text that can be read by anyone who
is able to watch the connection.  If you are concerned about this, you can
use the compressed protocol (in MySQL Version 3.22 and above) to make
traffic much more difficult to decipher.  To make the connection even more
secure, you should use SSH to get an encrypted TCP/IP connection between a
MySQL server and a MySQL client.  You can find an @code{Open Source} SSH
client at @uref{http://www.openssh.org/}, and a commercial SSH client at
@uref{http://www.ssh.com/}.

If you are using MySQL 4.0 or newer, you can also use internal OpenSSL support.
@xref{Secure connections}.

To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use passwords for all MySQL users. A client program does not necessarily
know the identify of the person running it. It is common for client/server
applications that the user can specify any username to the client program.
For example, anyone can use the @code{mysql} program to connect as any other
person simply by invoking it as @code{mysql -u other_user db_name} if
@code{other_user} has no password. If all users have a password,
connecting using another user's account becomes much more difficult.

To change the password for a user, use the @code{SET PASSWORD} statement.
It is also possible to update the @code{user} table in the @code{mysql}
database directly.  For example, to change the password of all MySQL accounts
that have a username of @code{root}, do this:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpwd')
    -> WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

@item
Don't run the MySQL server as the Unix @code{root} user.  This is
very dangerous, because any user with the @code{FILE} privilege will be able
to create files as @code{root} (for example, @code{~root/.bashrc}). To
prevent this, @code{mysqld} refuses to run as @code{root} unless that
is specified explicitly using a @code{--user=root} option.

@code{mysqld} can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user instead.
You can also create a separate Unix account named @code{mysql} to make
everything even more secure (use the account only for administering MySQL).
To start @code{mysqld} as another Unix user, add a @code{user}
option that specifies the username to the @code{[mysqld]} group of the
@file{/etc/my.cnf} option file or the @file{my.cnf} option file in the
server's data directory. For example:

@example
[mysqld]
user=mysql
@end example

This causes the server to start as the designated user whether you
start it manually or by using @code{mysqld_safe} or @code{mysql.server}.
For more details, see @ref{Changing MySQL user}.

Note that running @code{mysql} as a Unix user other than @code{root} does not
mean that you need to change the @code{root} username in the @code{user}
table. Usernames for MySQL accounts have nothing to do with usernames for Unix
accounts.

@item
Don't allow the use of symlinks to tables. (This can be disabled with the
@code{--skip-symlink} option.) This is especially important if you run
@code{mysqld} as @code{root}, because anyone that has write access to the
server's data directory could then delete any file in the system!
@xref{Symbolic links to tables}.

@item
Make sure that the only Unix user with read or write privileges in the
database directories is the user that @code{mysqld} runs as.

@item
Don't grant the @code{PROCESS} privilege to non-administrative users.
The output of @code{mysqladmin processlist} shows the text of the currently
executing queries, so any user who is allowed to execute that command
might be able to see if another user issues an @code{UPDATE user SET
password=PASSWORD('not_secure')} query.

@code{mysqld} reserves an extra connection for users who have the
@code{PROCESS} privilege, so that a MySQL @code{root} user can log
in and check server activity even if all normal connections are in use.

@item
Don't grant the @code{SUPER} privilege to non-administrative users.
It can be used to terminate client connections, change server operation by
changing the value of system variables, and control replication servers.

@item
Don't grant the @code{FILE} privilege to non-administrative users.
Any user that has this privilege can write a file anywhere in the
filesystem with the privileges of the @code{mysqld} daemon!  To make
this a bit safer, files generated with @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}
will not overwrite existing files and are writable by everyone.

@tindex @file{/etc/passwd}

The @code{FILE} privilege may also be used to read any file that is
world-readable or accessible to the Unix user that the server runs as.
With this privilege, you can read any file into a database table.
This could be abused, for example, by using @code{LOAD DATA} to load
@file{/etc/passwd} into a table, which then can be displayed with
@code{SELECT}.

@item
If you don't trust your DNS, you should use IP numbers rather than
hostnames in the grant tables. In any case, you should be very careful
about creating grant table entries using hostname values that contain
wildcards!

@item
If you want to restrict the number of connections allowed to a single account,
you can do so by setting the @code{max_user_connections} variable in
@code{mysqld}.
The @code{GRANT} statement also supports resource control options for limiting
the extent of server use allowed to an account.

@node Privileges options, LOAD DATA LOCAL, Security against attack, Security
@subsection Startup Options for @code{mysqld} Concerning Security

@c TODO: There may be overlap between this and the section that has
@c the general server option list...

The following @code{mysqld} options affect security:

@table @code
@item --local-infile[=@{0|1@}]
If you start the server with @code{--local-infile=0}, clients cannot use
@code{LOCAL} in @code{LOAD DATA} statements.
@xref{LOAD DATA LOCAL,  , @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}}.

@item --safe-show-database
With this option, the @code{SHOW DATABASES} statement displays the names
of only those databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
As of version 4.0.2, this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(it is enabled by default), because there is now a @code{SHOW DATABASES}
privilege that can be used to control access to database
names on a per-account basis. @xref{GRANT,  , @code{GRANT}}.

@item --safe-user-create
If this is enabled, a user cannot create new users with the @code{GRANT}
statement unless the user has the @code{INSERT} privilege for the
@code{mysql.user} table.  If you want a user to have the ability to create
new users with those privileges that the user has right to grant, you should
grant the user the following privilege:

@example
mysql> GRANT INSERT(user) ON mysql.user TO 'user'@@'hostname';
@end example

This will ensure that the user can't change any privilege columns directly,
but has to use the @code{GRANT} statement to give privileges to other users.

@item --skip-grant-tables
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all. This
gives everyone @strong{full access} to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing a @code{mysqladmin
flush-privileges} or @code{mysqladmin reload} command, or by issuing a
@code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement.)

@item --skip-name-resolve
Hostnames are not resolved.  All @code{Host} column values in the grant
tables must be IP numbers or @code{localhost}.

@item --skip-networking
Don't allow TCP/IP connections over the network.  All connections to
@code{mysqld} must be made via Unix socket files.
This option is unsuitable when using a MySQL version prior to 3.23.27 with
the MIT-pthreads package, because Unix socket files were not supported by
MIT-pthreads at that time.

@item --skip-show-database
Don't allow the @code{SHOW DATABASES} statement, unless the user has the
@code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege. As of version 4.0.2, you should no longer
need this option. Access now can be granted to specific accounts with the
@code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege.

@end table

@node LOAD DATA LOCAL,  , Privileges options, Security
@subsection Security Issues with @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}

The @code{LOAD DATA} statement can load a file that is located on the
server host, or it can load a file that is located on the client host when
the @code{LOCAL} keyword is specified.

There are two potential security issues with supporting the @code{LOCAL}
version of @code{LOAD DATA} statements:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The transfer of the file from the client host to the server host is initiated
by the MySQL server. In theory, a patched server could be built that would
tell the client program to transfer a file of the server's choosing rather
than the file named by the client in the @code{LOAD DATA} statement. Such a
server could access any file on the client host to which the client user has
read access.

@item
In a Web environment where the clients are connecting from a Web
server, a user could use @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} to read any files
that the Web server process has read access to (assuming a user could
run any command against the SQL server). In this environment, the client with
respect to the MySQL server actually is the Web server, not the program being
run by the user connecting to the Web server.

@end itemize

To deal with these problems, we changed how @code{LOAD DATA
LOCAL} is handled as of MySQL 3.23.49 and MySQL 4.0.2 (4.0.13 on Windows):

@itemize @bullet

@item
By default, all MySQL clients and libraries in binary distributions are
compiled with the @code{--enable-local-infile} option, to be compatible
with MySQL 3.23.48 and before.

@item
If you build MySQL from source but don't use the @code{--enable-local-infile}
option to @code{configure}, @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} cannot be used
by any client unless it is written explicitly to invoke
@code{mysql_options(... MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE, 0)}.
@xref{mysql_options, , @code{mysql_options()}}.

@item
You can disable all @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} commands from the server side
by starting @code{mysqld} with the @code{--local-infile=0} option.

@item
For the @code{mysql} command-line client, @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} can be
enabled by specifying the @code{--local-infile[=1]} option, or disabled with
the @code{--local-infile=0} option.  Similarly, for @code{mysqlimport},
the @code{--local} or @code{-L} option enable local data file loading. In
any case, successful use of a local loading operation requires that the
server is enabled to allow it.

@item
If @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} is disabled, either in the server or
the client, a client that attempts to issue such a statement receives the
following error message:

@example
ERROR 1148: The used command is not allowed with this MySQL version

@subsection What the Privilege System Does

@cindex system, privilege
@cindex privilege system
@cindex passwords, security

The primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to
authenticate a user connecting from a given host, and to associate that user
with privileges on a database such as
@code{SELECT}, @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE} and @code{DELETE}.

Additional functionality includes the ability to have an anonymous user and
to grant privileges for MySQL-specific functions such as @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} and administrative operations.


@node Privileges, Privileges provided, What Privileges, Privilege system
@subsection How the Privilege System Works

@cindex privilege system, described

The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may perform only the
operations allowed to them.  As a user, when you connect to a
MySQL server, your identity is determined by @strong{the host from
which you connect} and @strong{the username you specify}.  The system grants
privileges according to your identity and @strong{what you want to do}.

MySQL considers both your hostname and username in identifying you
because there is little reason to assume that a given username belongs to
the same person everywhere on the Internet.  For example, the user
@code{joe} who connects from @code{office.com} need not be the same
person as the user @code{joe} who connects from @code{elsewhere.com}.
MySQL handles this by allowing you to distinguish users on different
hosts that happen to have the same name:  you can grant @code{joe} one set
of privileges for connections from @code{office.com}, and a different set
of privileges for connections from @code{elsewhere.com}.

MySQL access control involves two stages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Stage 1: The server checks whether you are even allowed to connect.

@item
Stage 2: Assuming that you can connect, the server checks each statement you issue
to see whether you have sufficient privileges to perform it.  For
example, if you try to select rows from a table in a database or drop a table
from the database, the server verifies that you have the @code{SELECT}
privilege for the table or the @code{DROP} privilege for the database.
@end itemize

Note that if your privileges are changed (either by yourself or someone
else) while you are connected, those changes will not necessarily take
effect immediately for the next statement you issue.  See @ref{Privilege
changes} for details.

The server stores privilege information in the grant tables of the
@code{mysql} database (that is, in the database named @code{mysql}).
The MySQL server reads the contents of these tables into memory when it
starts and rereads them under the circumstances indicated in @ref{Privilege
changes}. Access-control decisions are based on the in-memory copies of the
grant tables.

Normally, you manipulate the contents of the grant tables indirectly by using
the @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements to set up accounts and control
the privileges available to each one.
@xref{GRANT,  , @code{GRANT}}.
The discussion here describes the underlying structure of the grant tables and
how the server uses their contents when interacting with clients.

The server uses the @code{user}, @code{db}, and @code{host} tables in the
@code{mysql} database at both stages of access control.  The columns in these
grant tables are shown here:

During the second stage of access control (request verification), the server
may, if the request involves tables, additionally consult the
@code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables that provide finer control
at the table and column levels.  The columns in these
tables are shown here:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .20 .20
@item @strong{Table Name}       @tab @strong{tables_priv} @tab @strong{columns_priv}

@item @strong{Scope columns}    @tab @code{Host}          @tab @code{Host}

@item                           @tab @code{Table_name}    @tab @code{Table_name}
@item                           @tab                      @tab @code{Column_name}

@item @strong{Privilege columns} @tab @code{Table_priv}    @tab @code{Column_priv}

@item                           @tab @code{Grantor}       @tab
@end multitable

The @code{Timestamp} and @code{Grantor} columns currently are unused and are
discussed no further here.

Each grant table contains scope columns and privilege columns:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Scope columns determine the scope of each entry (row) in the tables, that is, the
context in which the entry applies.  For example, a @code{user} table entry
with @code{Host} and @code{User} values of @code{'thomas.loc.gov'} and
@code{'bob'} would be used for authenticating connections made to the server
from the host @code{thomas.loc.gov} by a client that specifies a username of
@code{bob}.  Similarly, a @code{db}
table entry with @code{Host}, @code{User}, and @code{Db} column values of
@code{'thomas.loc.gov'}, @code{'bob'} and @code{'reports'} would be used when
@code{bob} connects from the host @code{thomas.loc.gov} to access the
@code{reports} database.  The @code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv}
tables contain scope columns indicating tables or table/column combinations
to which each entry applies.

@item
Privilege columns indicate the privileges granted by a table entry, that is,
what operations can be performed.  The server combines the information in the
various grant tables to form a complete description of a user's privileges.
The rules used to do this are described in @ref{Request access}.

@end itemize

Scope columns contain strings. They are declared as shown here; the default value for
each is the empty string:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .15
@item @strong{Column Name} @tab @strong{Type}
@item @code{Host}         @tab @code{CHAR(60)}
@item @code{User}         @tab @code{CHAR(16)}
@item @code{Password}     @tab @code{CHAR(16)}
@item @code{Db}           @tab @code{CHAR(64)}
@item @code{Table_name}   @tab @code{CHAR(60)}
@item @code{Column_name}  @tab @code{CHAR(60)}
@end multitable

Before MySQL 3.23, the @code{Db} column is @code{CHAR(32)} in some tables
and @code{CHAR(60)} in others.

@cindex case-sensitivity, in access checking
For access-checking purposes, comparisons of @code{Host} values are
case-insensitive.  @code{User}, @code{Password}, @code{Db}, and
@code{Table_name} values are case-sensitive.
@code{Column_name} values are case-insensitive in MySQL Version
3.22.12 or later.

In the @code{user}, @code{db}, and @code{host} tables, each privilege
is listed in a separate column that is declared as
@code{ENUM('N','Y') DEFAULT 'N'}. In other words, each privilege can disabled
or enabled, with the default being disabled.

In the @code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables, the privilege
columns are declared as @code{SET} columns. Values in these columns can
contain any combination of the privileges controlled by the table:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .55
@item @strong{Table Name}
 @tab @strong{Column Name}
 @tab @strong{Possible Set Elements}
@item @code{tables_priv}
 @tab @code{Table_priv}
 @tab @code{'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'Delete', 'Create', 'Drop', 'Grant', 'References', 'Index', 'Alter'}
@item @code{tables_priv}
 @tab @code{Column_priv}
 @tab @code{'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'References'}
@item @code{columns_priv}
 @tab @code{Column_priv}
 @tab @code{'Select', 'Insert', 'Update', 'References'}
@end multitable

Briefly, the server uses the grant tables as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{user} table scope columns determine whether to reject or allow
incoming connections.  For allowed connections, any privileges granted in
the @code{user} table indicate the user's global (superuser) privileges.
These privileges apply to @strong{all} databases on the server.

@item
The @code{db} table scope columns determine which users can access which
databases from which hosts.  The privilege columns determine which operations
are allowed. A privilege granted at the database level applies to the database
and to all its tables.

@item
The @code{host} table is used in conjunction with the @code{db} table when you
want a given @code{db} table entry to apply to several hosts.  For example,
if you want a user to be able to use a database from several hosts in
your network, leave the @code{Host} value empty in the user's @code{db} table
entry, then populate the @code{host} table with an entry for each of those
hosts.  This mechanism is described more detail in @ref{Request access}.

@strong{Note:} The @code{host} table is not affected by the @code{GRANT} and
@code{REVOKE} statements. Most MySQL installations need not use this table at
all.

@item
The @code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables are similar to
the @code{db} table, but are more fine-grained: They apply at the
table and column levels rather than at the database level.
A privilege granted at the table level applies to the table and to all its
columns.
A privilege granted at the column level applies only to a specific column.
@end itemize

Administrative privileges (such as @code{RELOAD} or @code{SHUTDOWN})
are specified only in the @code{user} table.  This is because
administrative operations are operations on the server itself and are not
database-specific, so there is no reason to list these privileges in the
other grant tables.  In fact, to determine whether you can perform an
administrative operation, the server need consult only the @code{user} table.

The @code{FILE} privilege also is specified only in the @code{user} table.
It is not an administrative privilege as such, but your ability to read or
write files on the server host is independent of the database you are
accessing.

The @code{mysqld} server reads the contents of the grant tables into memory
when it starts. You can tell it to reread the tables by issuing a @code{FLUSH
PRIVILEGES} statement or executing a @code{mysqladmin flush-privileges} or
@code{mysqladmin reload} command.
Changes to the grant tables take effect as indicated in
@ref{Privilege changes}.

When you modify the contents of the grant tables, it is a good idea to make
sure that your changes set up privileges the way you want. One way to check
the privileges for a given account is to use the @code{SHOW GRANTS} statement.
For example, to determine the privileges that are granted to an account with
@code{Host} and @code{User} values of @code{pc84.example.com} and @code{bob},
issue this statement:

@example
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bob'@@'pc84.example.com';
@end example

A useful
diagnostic tool is the @code{mysqlaccess} script, which Yves Carlier has
provided for the MySQL distribution.  Invoke @code{mysqlaccess} with
the @code{--help} option to find out how it works.
Note that @code{mysqlaccess} checks access using only the @code{user},
@code{db} and @code{host} tables.  It does not check table or column
privileges specified in the @code{tables_priv} or @code{columns_priv} tables.

@ref{Access denied}.  For general advice on security issues, see
@ref{Security}.

@subsection Privileges Provided by MySQL

@cindex privilege information, location

Information about account privileges is stored in the @code{user}, @code{db},
@code{host}, @code{tables_priv}, and @code{columns_priv} tables in the
@code{mysql} database.  The MySQL server reads the contents of these
tables into memory when it starts and rereads them under the circumstances
indicated in @ref{Privilege changes}.  Access-control decisions are based
on the in-memory copies of the grant tables.

The names used in this manual to refer to the privileges provided by
MySQL are shown in the following table, along with the table column name
associated with each privilege in the grant tables and the context in
which the privilege applies. Further information about the meaning of
each privilege may be found at @ref{GRANT, , @code{GRANT}}.

@c TODO: probably should have that information here as well.

@end multitable

The @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES}, @code{EXECUTE}, @code{LOCK TABLES},
@code{REPLICATION CLIENT}, @code{REPLICATION SLAVE}, @code{SHOW DATABASES},
and @code{SUPER} privileges were added in MySQL 4.0.2.

The @code{EXECUTE} and @code{REFERENCES} privileges currently are unused.

The @code{SELECT}, @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, and @code{DELETE}
privileges allow you to perform operations on rows in existing tables in
a database.

@code{SELECT} statements require the @code{SELECT} privilege only if they
actually retrieve rows from a table.  Some @code{SELECT} statements do not
access tables and can be executed without permission for any database.
For example, you can use the @code{mysql} client as a simple calculator
to evaluate expressions that make no reference to tables:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1+1;
mysql> SELECT PI()*2;
@end example

The @code{CREATE} and @code{DROP} privileges allow you to create new
databases and tables, or to drop (remove) existing databases and tables.
Note that if you grant the @code{DROP} privilege for the @code{mysql}
database to a user, that user can drop the database in which the
MySQL access privileges are stored!

The @code{INDEX} privilege allows you to create or drop (remove) indexes.
Note that @code{INDEX} applies to existing tables.
If you have the @code{CREATE} privilege for a table, you can include index
definitions in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.

The @code{ALTER} privilege allows you to use @code{ALTER TABLE} to change the
structure of or rename tables.

The @code{GRANT} privilege allows you to give to other users those
privileges you yourself possess.

The @code{FILE} privilege gives you permission to read and write files on
the server host using the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} and @code{SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE} statements. A user who has the @code{FILE} privilege can read any
file on the server host that is either world-readable or readable by the MySQL
server. (Note that this implies the user can read any file in any database
directory, because the server can access any of those files.)
The @code{FILE} privilege also allows the user to create new files in any
directory where the MySQL server has write access. (Existing files cannot be
overwritten.)

The remaining privileges are used for administrative operations. Many of
them can be performed by using using the @code{mysqladmin} program or by
issuing SQL statements.  The following table shows which @code{mysqladmin}
commands each administrative privilege allows you to execute:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .75
@item @strong{Privilege}  @tab @strong{Commands Permitted to Privilege Holders}
@item @code{RELOAD}       @tab @code{flush-hosts}, @code{flush-logs}, @code{flush-privileges}, @code{flush-status}, @code{flush-tables}, @code{flush-threads}, @code{refresh}, and @code{reload}
@item @code{SHUTDOWN}     @tab @code{shutdown}
@item @code{PROCESS}      @tab @code{processlist}
@item @code{SUPER}        @tab @code{kill}
@end multitable

The @code{reload} command tells the server to reread the grant tables
into memory.  @code{flush-privileges} is a synonym for @code{reload}.
The @code{refresh} command closes and reopens the log files and flushes
all tables.  The other @code{flush-*} commands perform functions similar to
@code{refresh} but are more specific and may be preferable in some instances.
For example, if you want to flush just the log files, @code{flush-logs}
is a better choice than @code{refresh}.

The @code{shutdown} command shuts down the server. This command can be issued
only from @code{mysqladmin}. There is no corresponding SQL statement.

The @code{processlist} command displays information about the threads
executing within the server (that is, about the statements being executed by
clients associated with other accounts).
The @code{kill} command terminates server threads.
You can always display or kill your own threads, but you need the
@code{PROCESS} privilege to display threads initiated by other users and
and the @code{SUPER} privilege to kill them.
@xref{KILL,  , @code{KILL}}. Prior to MySQL 4.0.2 when @code{SUPER} was
introduced, the @code{PROCESS} privilege controls the ability to both see and
terminate threads for other clients.

The @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES} privilege allows the use of the keyword
@code{TEMPORARY} in @code{CREATE TABLE} statements.

The @code{LOCK TABLES} privilege allows the use of explicit @code{LOCK TABLES}
statements to lock tables for which you have the @code{SELECT} privilege.
This includes the use of write locks, which prevents anyone else from reading
the locked table.

The @code{REPLICATION CLIENT} privilege allows the use of @code{SHOW MASTER
STATUS} and @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}.

The @code{REPLICATION SLAVE} privilege should be granted to accounts that are
used by slave servers when they connect to the current server as their master.
Without this privilege, the slave cannot request updates that have been made
to databases on the master server.

The @code{SHOW DATABASES} privilege allows the account to see database names
by issuing the @code{SHOW DATABASE} statement.

It is a good idea in general to grant privileges only to those accounts
that need them, but you should exercise particular caution in granting
administrative privileges:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{GRANT} privilege allows users to give their privileges to
other users.  Two users with different privileges and with the @code{GRANT}
privilege are able to combine privileges.

@item
The @code{ALTER} privilege may be used to subvert the privilege system
by renaming tables.

@item
The @code{FILE} privilege can be abused to read into a database table any
files that the MySQL server can read on the server host. This includes all
world-readable files and files in the server's data directory. The table
can then be accessed using @code{SELECT} to transfer its contents to the
client host.

@item
The @code{SHUTDOWN} privilege can be abused to deny service to other
users entirely by terminating the server.

@item
The @code{PROCESS} privilege can be used to view the plain text of
currently executing queries, including queries that set or change passwords.

@item
The @code{SUPER} privilege can be used to terminate other clients or change
how the server operates.

@item
Privileges granted for the @code{mysql} database itself can be used to
change passwords and other access privilege information.  Passwords are
stored encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the
plain text password.  However, a user with write access to the @code{user}
table @code{Password} column can change an account's password, and then
connect to the MySQL server using that account.

@end itemize

There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL
privilege system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied access.
That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then refuse the connection.

@item
You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop tables
in a database but not to create or drop the database itself.
@end itemize

@subsection Connecting to the MySQL Server

@cindex connecting, to the server
@cindex default hostname
@cindex hostname, default
@cindex server, connecting

MySQL client programs generally expect you to specify connection
parameters when you want to access a MySQL server:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The name of the host where the MySQL server is running
@item
Your username
@item
Your password
@end itemize

For example, the
@code{mysql} client can be started as follows from a command-line prompt
(indicated here by @code{shell>}):

@example
shell> mysql -h host_name -u user_name -pyour_pass
@end example

Alternate forms of the @code{-h}, @code{-u}, and @code{-p} options are
@code{--host=host_name}, @code{--user=user_name}, and
@code{--password=your_pass}.  Note that there is @emph{no space} between
@code{-p} or @code{--password=} and the password following it.

If you use a @code{-p} or @code{--password} option but do not specify the
password value, the client program will prompt you to enter the password.
The password is not displayed as you enter it.
This is more secure than giving the password on the command line.
Any user on your system may be able to see a password specified on the command
line by executing a command such as @code{ps auxww}.
@xref{Password security}.

MySQL client programs use default values for any connection parameter option
that you do not specify:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The default hostname is @code{localhost}.

@item
The default username is @code{ODBC} on Windows and your Unix login name
on Unix.

@item
No password is supplied if @code{-p} is missing.
@end itemize

Thus, for a Unix user with a login name of @code{joe}, all of the following
commands are equivalent:

@example
shell> mysql -h localhost -u joe
shell> mysql -h localhost
shell> mysql -u joe
shell> mysql
@end example

Other MySQL clients behave similarly.

You can specify different default values to be used when you
make a connection, so that you need not enter them on the command line each
time you invoke a client program.  This can be done in a couple of ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@tindex .my.cnf file
You can specify connection parameters in the @code{[client]} section of an
option file.  The relevant section of the file might look like this:

@subsection Access Control, Stage 1: Connection Verification

@cindex access control
@cindex control access
@cindex connecting, verification
@cindex testing, connection to the server

When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.  If not, the server
denies access to you completely.  Otherwise, the server accepts the
connection, then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The client host from which you connect

@item
Your MySQL username
@end itemize

Identity checking is performed using the three @code{user} table scope columns
(@code{Host}, @code{User}, and @code{Password}).  The server accepts the
connection only if the @code{Host} and @code{User} columns in some
@code{user} table record match the client hostname and username,
and the client supplies the password specified in that record.

@code{Host} values in the @code{user} table may be specified as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A @code{Host} value may be a hostname or an IP number, or @code{'localhost'}
to indicate the local host.

@item
@cindex wildcards, in @code{mysql.user} table
You can use the wildcard characters @samp{%} and @samp{_} in @code{Host}
column values.
These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations
performed with the @code{LIKE} operator.
For example, a @code{Host} value of @code{'%'} matches any hostname, whereas a
value of @code{'%.mysql.com'} matches any host in the @code{mysql.com} domain.

@item
@cindex netmask notation, in @code{mysql.user} table
As of MySQL Version 3.23, for @code{Host} values specified as
IP numbers, you can specify a netmask indicating how many address bits to
use for the network number. For example:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.*
    -> TO david@@'192.58.197.0/255.255.255.0';
@end example

This allows @code{david} to connect from any client host having an IP number
@code{client_ip} for which the following condition is true:

@example
client_ip & netmask = host_ip
@end example

That is, for the @code{GRANT} statement just shown:

@example
client_ip & 255.255.255.0 = 192.58.197.0
@end example

IP numbers that satisfy this condition and can connect to the
MySQL server are those that lie in the range from @code{192.58.197.0} to
@code{192.58.197.255}.

@item
A blank @code{Host} value in a @code{db} table record means that its
privileges should be combined with those in the entry in the @code{host}
table that matches the client hostname.  The privileges are combined
using an AND (intersection) operation, not OR (union).  You can find more
information about the @code{host} table in @ref{Request access}.

A blank @code{Host} value in the other grant tables is the same as @code{'%'}.

@end itemize

Because you can use IP wildcard values in the @code{Host} column
(for example, @code{'144.155.166.%'} to match every host on a
subnet), someone could try to exploit this capability by naming a host
@code{144.155.166.somewhere.com}.  To foil such attempts, MySQL disallows
matching on hostnames that start with digits and a dot. Thus, if you have
a host named something like @code{1.2.foo.com}, its name will never match
the @code{Host} column of the grant tables.  An IP wildcard value can
match only IP numbers, not hostnames.

@cindex anonymous user
In the @code{User} column, wildcard characters are not allowed, but you can
specify a blank value, which matches any name.  If the @code{user} table
entry that matches an incoming connection has a blank username, the user is
considered to be an anonymous user with no name, not a user with the
name that the client actually specified.  This means that a blank username
is used for all further access checking for the duration of the connection
(that is, during Stage 2).

The @code{Password} column can be blank.  This is not a wildcard and does
not mean that any password matches. It means that the user must connect
without specifying a password.

@findex PASSWORD()
Non-blank @code{Password} values in the @code{user} table represent
encrypted passwords.  MySQL does not store passwords in plaintext form for
anyone to see.  Rather, the password supplied by a user who is attempting to
connect is encrypted (using the @code{PASSWORD()} function). The encrypted
password then is used during the connection process when checking whether
the password is correct. (This is done without the encrypted password ever
traveling over the connection.)  Note that from MySQL's point of view the
encrypted password is the REAL password, so you should not give anyone
access to it!  In particular, don't give non-administrative users read
access to the tables in the @code{mysql} database!

From version 4.1 on, MySQL employs a stronger authentication method that has
better password protection during the connection process than in earlier
versions. It is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed or the
@code{mysql} database is captured.  Password encryption is discussed further
in @ref{Password hashing}.

The following examples show how various combinations of @code{Host} and
@code{User} values in the @code{user} table apply to incoming
connections:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .15 .50
@item @code{Host} @strong{Value} @tab @code{User} @strong{Value} @tab @strong{Connections Matched by Entry}
@item @code{'thomas.loc.gov'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from @code{thomas.loc.gov}
@item @code{'thomas.loc.gov'} @tab @code{''} @tab Any user, connecting from @code{thomas.loc.gov}
@item  @code{'%'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from any host
@item @code{'%'} @tab  @code{''} @tab Any user, connecting from any host
@item @code{'%.loc.gov'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from any host in the @code{loc.gov} domain
@item @code{'x.y.%'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from @code{x.y.net}, @code{x.y.com},@code{x.y.edu}, etc. (this is probably not useful)
@item @code{'144.155.166.177'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from the host with IP address @code{144.155.166.177}
@item @code{'144.155.166.%'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab @code{fred}, connecting from any host in the @code{144.155.166} class C subnet
@item @code{'144.155.166.0/255.255.255.0'} @tab @code{'fred'} @tab Same as previous example
@end multitable

It is possible for the client hostname and username of
an incoming connection to match more than one entry in the
@code{user} table.  The preceding set of examples demonstrates this:
Several of the entries shown match a connection from @code{thomas.loc.gov} by
@code{fred}.

When multiple matches are possible, the server must determine which of them to
use.  It resolves this issue as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Whenever the server reads the @code{user} table into memory, it sorts the
entries.
@item
When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through the entries in
sorted order.
@item
The server uses the first entry that matches the client hostname and username.
@end itemize

To see how this works, suppose that the @code{user} table looks like this:

@example
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| %         | root     | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
+-----------+----------+-
@end example

When the server reads in the table, it orders the entries with the
most-specific @code{Host} values first.  Literal hostnames and IP numbers
are the most specific. The pattern @code{'%'} means ``any host'' and is
least specific.  Entries with the same @code{Host} value are ordered with
the most-specific @code{User} values first (a blank @code{User} value means
``any user'' and is least specific). For the @code{user} table just shown,
the result after sorting looks like this:

@example
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| %         | root     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
@end example

@cindex grant tables, sorting
@cindex sorting, grant tables
@cindex @code{user} table, sorting
When a client attempts to connect, the server looks through the sorted entries
and uses the first match found.  For a connection from @code{localhost} by
@code{jeffrey}, two of the entries in the table match:
The one with @code{Host} and @code{User} values of @code{'localhost'} and
@code{''}, and the one with values of @code{'%'} and @code{'jeffrey'}.
The @code{'localhost'} entry appears first in sorted order, so that is the one
the server uses.

Here is another example.  Suppose that the @code{user} table looks like this:

@example
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
+----------------+----------+-
@end example

The sorted table looks like this:

@example
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
+----------------+----------+-
@end example

A connection by @code{jeffrey} from @code{thomas.loc.gov} is matched by the
first entry, whereas a connection by @code{jeffrey} from @code{whitehouse.gov}
is matched by the second.

It is a common misconception to think that for a given username, all entries
that explicitly name that user will be used first when the server attempts to
find a match for the connection.  This is simply not true.  The previous
example illustrates this, where a connection from @code{thomas.loc.gov} by
@code{jeffrey} is first matched not by the entry containing @code{'jeffrey'}
as the @code{User} column value, but by the entry with no username!
(As a result, @code{jeffrey} will be authenticated as an anonymous user, even
though he specified a username when connecting.)

If you are able to connect to the server, but your privileges are not
what you expect, you probably are being authenticated as some other
account.  To find out what account the server used to authenticate
you, use the @code{CURRENT_USER()} function. It returns a value in
@code{user_name@@host_name} format that indicates the @code{User}
and @code{Host} values from the matching @code{user} table record.
Suppose that @code{jeffrey} connects and issues the following query:

@example
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER();
+----------------+
| CURRENT_USER() |
+----------------+
| @@localhost     |
+----------------+
@end example

The result shown here indicates that the matching @code{user} table entry
had a blank @code{User} column value.  In other words, the server is
treating @code{jeffrey} as an anonymous user.

The @code{CURRENT_USER()} function is available as of MySQL 4.0.6.
@xref{Information functions}.
Another thing you can do to diagnose authentication problems is to print
out the @code{user} table and sort it by hand to see where the first
match is being made.


@node Request access, Privilege changes, Connection access, Privilege system
@subsection Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification

Once you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2 of access
control.  For each request that comes in on the connection, the server
determines what operation you want to perform, then checks whether you have
sufficient privileges to do so.  This is where the privilege columns in the
grant tables come into play.  These privileges can come from any of the
@code{user}, @code{db}, @code{host}, @code{tables_priv}, or
@code{columns_priv} tables.  (You may find it helpful to refer to
@ref{Privileges}, which lists the columns present in each of the grant
tables.)

The @code{user} table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global
basis and that apply no matter what the current database is.  For example, if
the @code{user} table grants you the @code{DELETE} privilege, you can
delete rows from any database on the server host!  In other words,
@code{user} table privileges are superuser privileges.  It is wise to grant
privileges in the @code{user} table only to superusers such as
database administrators.  For other users, you should leave the privileges
in the @code{user} table set to @code{'N'} and grant privileges at more
specific levels only. You can grant privileges for particular databases,
tables, or columns.

@cindex anonymous user
@cindex wildcards, in @code{mysql.db} table
@cindex wildcards, in @code{mysql.host} table
The @code{db} and @code{host} tables grant database-specific privileges.
Values in the scope columns of these tables can take the following forms:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The wildcard characters @samp{%} and @samp{_} can be used in the @code{Host}
and @code{Db} columns of either table.  These have the same meaning as for
pattern-matching operations performed with the @code{LIKE} operator.  If you
want to use either character literally when granting privileges, you must
escape it with a backslash.  For example, to include @samp{_} character
as part of a database name, specify it as @samp{\_} in the @code{GRANT}
statement.

@item
A @code{'%'} @code{Host} value in the @code{db} table means ``any host.'' A
blank @code{Host} value in the @code{db} table means ``consult the
@code{host} table for further information'' (a process that is described later
in this section).

@item
A @code{'%'} or blank @code{Host} value in the @code{host} table means ``any
host.''

@item
A @code{'%'} or blank @code{Db} value in either table means ``any database.''

@item
A blank @code{User} value in either table matches the anonymous user.
@end itemize

@cindex grant tables, sorting
@cindex sorting, grant tables
@cindex @code{db} table, sorting
@cindex @code{host} table, sorting

The server reads in and sorts the @code{db} and @code{host} tables at the
same time that it reads the @code{user} table.  The server sorts the @code{db}
table based on the @code{Host}, @code{Db}, and @code{User} scope columns,
and sorts the @code{host} table based on the @code{Host} and @code{Db}
scope columns.  As with the @code{user} table, sorting puts the
most-specific values first and least-specific values last, and when the
server looks for matching entries, it uses the first match that it finds.

@cindex wildcards, in @code{mysql.tables_priv} table
@cindex wildcards, in @code{mysql.columns_priv} table

The @code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables grant table-specific and
column-specific privileges.  Values in the scope columns of these tables can
take the following form:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The wildcard characters @samp{%} and @samp{_} can be used in the @code{Host}
column of either table.  These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching
operations performed with the @code{LIKE} operator.

@item
A @code{'%'} or blank @code{Host} value in either table means ``any host.''

@item
The @code{Db}, @code{Table_name} and @code{Column_name} columns cannot contain
wildcards or be blank in either table.
@end itemize

The server sorts the @code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables based
on the @code{Host}, @code{Db}, and @code{User} columns.  This is similar to
@code{db} table sorting, but simpler because only the @code{Host} column can
contain wildcards.

The request verification process is described here.  (If you are familiar
with the access-checking source code, you will notice that the description
here differs slightly from the algorithm used in the code.  The description
is equivalent to what the code actually does; it differs only to make the
explanation simpler.)

For requests that require administrative privileges such as @code{SHUTDOWN} or
@code{RELOAD}, the
server checks only the @code{user} table entry because that is the only table
that specifies administrative privileges.  Access is granted if the entry
allows the requested operation and denied otherwise.  For example, if you
want to execute @code{mysqladmin shutdown} but your @code{user} table entry
doesn't grant the @code{SHUTDOWN} privilege to you, the server denies access
without even checking the @code{db} or @code{host} tables.  (They
contain no @code{Shutdown_priv} column, so there is no need to do so.)

For database-related requests (@code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, etc.), the
server first checks the user's global (superuser) privileges by looking in
the @code{user} table entry.  If the entry allows the requested operation,
access is granted.  If the global privileges in the @code{user} table are
insufficient, the server determines the user's database-specific privileges
by checking the @code{db} and @code{host} tables:

@enumerate
@item
The server looks in the @code{db} table for a match on the @code{Host},
@code{Db}, and @code{User} columns.  The @code{Host} and @code{User} columns are
matched to the connecting user's hostname and MySQL username.  The
@code{Db} column is matched to the database the user wants to access.  If
there is no entry for the @code{Host} and @code{User}, access is denied.

@item
If there is a matching @code{db} table entry and its @code{Host} column is
not blank, that entry defines the user's database-specific privileges.

@item
If the matching @code{db} table entry's @code{Host} column is blank, it
signifies that the @code{host} table enumerates which hosts should be allowed
access to the database.  In this case, a further lookup is done in the
@code{host} table to find a match on the @code{Host} and @code{Db} columns.
If no @code{host} table entry matches, access is denied.  If there is a
match, the user's database-specific privileges are computed as the
intersection (@strong{not} the union!) of the privileges in the @code{db} and
@code{host} table entries; that is, the privileges that are @code{'Y'} in both
entries.  (This way you can grant general privileges in the @code{db} table
entry and then selectively restrict them on a host-by-host basis using the
@code{host} table entries.)
@end enumerate

After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the @code{db}
and @code{host} table entries, the server adds them to the global privileges
granted by the @code{user} table.  If the result allows the requested
operation, access is granted.  Otherwise, the server successively
checks the user's table and column privileges in the @code{tables_priv}
and @code{columns_priv} tables, adds those to the user's privileges,
and allows or denies access based on the result.

Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a user's
privileges are calculated may be summarized like this:

@example
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
@end example

It may not be apparent why, if the global @code{user} entry privileges are
initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the server
adds those privileges to the database, table, and column privileges
later. The reason is that a request might require more than one type of
privilege.  For example, if you execute an @code{INSERT INTO ...  SELECT}
statement, you need both the @code{INSERT} and the @code{SELECT} privileges.
Your privileges might be such that the @code{user} table entry grants one
privilege and the @code{db} table entry grants the other.  In this case, you
have the necessary privileges to perform the request, but the server cannot
tell that from either table by itself; the privileges granted by the entries
in both tables must be combined.

@cindex @code{host} table
@cindex tables, @code{host}

The @code{host} table is not affected by the @code{GRANT} or @code{REVOKE}
statements, so it is unused in most MySQL installations. If you modify
it directly, you can use it for some specialized purposes, such as to to
maintain a list of secure servers.  For example, at TcX, the @code{host}
table contains a list of all machines on the local network. These are
granted all privileges.

You can also use the @code{host} table to indicate hosts that are @strong{not}
secure.  Suppose that you have a machine @code{public.your.domain} that is located
in a public area that you do not consider secure.  You can allow access to
all hosts on your network except that machine by using @code{host} table
entries
like this:

@example
+--------------------+----+-
| Host               | Db | ...
+--------------------+----+-
| public.your.domain | %  | ... (all privileges set to 'N')
| %.your.domain      | %  | ... (all privileges set to 'Y')
+--------------------+----+-
@end example

@cindex privilege, changes
@cindex changes to privileges
@cindex tables, grant
@cindex grant tables

Naturally, you should always test your entries in the grant tables (for
example, by using @code{mysqlaccess}) to make sure that your access privileges are
actually set up the way you think they are.


@node Privilege changes, Access denied, Request access, Privilege system
@subsection When Privilege Changes Take Effect

When @code{mysqld} starts, all grant table contents are read into memory and
become effective at that point for access control.

When the server reloads the grant tables, privileges for
existing client connections are affected as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's next
request.

@item
Database privilege changes take effect at the next @code{USE db_name}
statement.

@item
Changes to global privileges and passwords take effect the next time
the client connects.
@end itemize

If you modify the grant tables using @code{GRANT}, @code{REVOKE}, or
@code{SET PASSWORD}, the server notices these changes and reloads the
grant tables into memory again immediately.

If you modify the grant tables directly using statements such as
@code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE}, your changes have
no effect on privilege checking until you either restart the server
or tell it to reload the tables.  To reload the grant tables manually,
issue a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement or execute a @code{mysqladmin
flush-privileges} or @code{mysqladmin reload} command.

If you change the grant tables directly but forget to reload them, your
changes will have @emph{no effect} until you restart the server.  This may
leave you wondering why your changes don't seem to make any difference!


@node Access denied, Password hashing, Privilege changes, Privilege system
@subsection Causes of @code{Access denied} Errors

@c TODO: some of these items apply only to old systems and are now more
@c of archaeological than practical value. Probably should move them to
@c the end of the list.

If you encounter problems when you try to connect to the
MySQL server, the following items describe some courses of
action you can take to correct the problem.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Make sure that the server is running. If it is not, you cannot connect to it.
For example, if you attempt to connect to the server and see a message such
as one of those following, one cause might be that the server is not running:

@example
shell> mysql
ERROR 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on 'host_name' (111)
shell> mysql
ERROR 2002: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
'/tmp/mysql.sock' (111)
@end example

It might also be that the server is running, but you are trying to connect
using a TCP/IP port, named pipe, or Unix socket file different than those
on which the server is listening. To correct this when you invoke a client
program, specify a @code{--port} option to indicate the proper port, or a
@code{--socket} option to indicate the proper named pipe or Unix socket
file.

@item
The grant tables must be properly set up so that the server can use them for
access control.  For installations on Windows using a binary distribution
or on Linux using a server RPM distribution, the installation process
initializes the @code{mysql} database containing the grant tables. For
other MySQL installation types, you should initialize the grant tables
manually by running the @code{mysql_install_db} script.
@xref{Default privileges}.

One way to determine whether you need to initialize the grant tables is to
look for a @file{mysql} directory under the data directory. (The data
directory normally is named @file{data} or @file{var} and is located under
your MySQL installation directory.)  Make sure that you have a file named
@file{user.MYD} in the @file{mysql} database directory.  If you do not,
execute the @code{mysql_install_db} script.  After running this script and
starting the server, test the initial privileges by executing this command:

@example
shell> mysql -u root test
@end example

The server should let you connect without error.

@item
After a fresh installation, you should connect to the server and set up
your users and their access permissions:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
@end example

The server should let you connect because the MySQL @code{root} user
has no password initially.  That is also a security risk, so setting the
password for the
@code{root} accounts is something you should do while you're setting up
your other MySQL users.
For instructions on setting the initial passwords, see @ref{Default
privileges}.

@item
@cindex @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables}
If you have updated an existing MySQL installation to a newer version, did
you run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script?  If not, do so. The
structure of the grant tables changes occasionally when new capabilities are
added, so you should always make sure after an upgrade that your tables have
the current structure. For instructions, see @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

@item
If a client program receives the following error message when it tries
to connect, it means that the server expects passwords in a newer format
than the client is capable of generating:

@example
shell> mysql
Client does not support authentication protocol requested
by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
@end example

For instructions on how to deal with this, see @ref{Password hashing}.

@item
If you try to connect as @code{root} and get the following error,
it means that you don't have an entry in the @code{user} table with a
@code{User} column value of @code{'root'} and that @code{mysqld} cannot
resolve the hostname for your client:

@example
Access denied for user: '@@unknown' to database mysql
@end example

In this case, you must restart the server with the @code{--skip-grant-tables}
option and edit your @file{/etc/hosts} or @file{\windows\hosts} file to
add an entry for your host.

@item
@cindex option files
@cindex configuration files
@cindex environment variables
@tindex .my.cnf file
Remember that client programs will use connection parameters specified
in option files or environment variables.  If a client program seems to
be sending incorrect default connection parameters when you don't specify
them on the command line, check your environment and any applicable option
files. For example, if you get @code{Access denied} when you run a client
without any options, make sure that you haven't specified an old password in
any of your option files!

You can suppress the use of option files with the @code{--no-defaults}
option as follows:

@example
shell> mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root ver
@end example

The option files that clients use are listed in @ref{Option files}.
Environment variables are listed in @ref{Environment variables}.

@item
If you get the following error, it means that you are using an incorrect
@code{root} password:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
Access denied for user: 'root@@localhost' (Using password: YES)
@end example

If the preceding error occurs even when you haven't specified a password,
it means that you have an incorrect password listed in some option
file. Try the @code{--no-defaults} option as described in the previous item.

For information on changing passwords, see @ref{Passwords}.

If you have lost the @code{root} password, you can restart @code{mysqld}
with @code{--skip-grant-tables} to change the password.
@xref{Resetting permissions}.

@item
If you change a password by using @code{SET PASSWORD}, @code{INSERT}, or
@code{UPDATE}, you must encrypt the password using the @code{PASSWORD()}
function.  If you do not use @code{PASSWORD()} for these statements,
the password will not work. For example, the following statement sets a
password, but fails to encrypt it, so the user will not be able to connect
afterward:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'abe'@@'host_name' = 'eagle';
@end example

Instead, set the password like this:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'abe'@@'host_name' = PASSWORD('eagle');
@end example

The @code{PASSWORD()} function is unnecessary when you specify a password
using the @code{GRANT} statement or the @code{mysqladmin password} command,
both of which automatically use @code{PASSWORD()} to encrypt the password.
@xref{Passwords}.

@item
@code{localhost} is a synonym for your local hostname, and is also the
default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host
explicitly.  However, connections to @code{localhost} on Unix systems
do not work if you are using a MySQL version older than 3.23.27 that uses
MIT-pthreads: @code{localhost} connections are made using Unix socket files,
which were not supported by MIT-pthreads at that time.

To avoid this problem on such systems, you can use a @code{--host=127.0.0.1}
option to name the server host explicitly.  This will make a TCP/IP
connection to the local @code{mysqld} server. You can also use TCP/IP by
specifying a @code{--host} option that uses the actual hostname of the
local host.  In this case, the hostname must be specified in a @code{user}
table entry on the server host, even though you are running the client
program on the same host as the server.

@item
If you get an @code{Access denied} error when trying to connect to the
database with @code{mysql -u user_name}, you may have a problem
with the @code{user} table. Check this by executing @code{mysql -u root
mysql} and issuing this SQL statement:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM user;
@end example

The result should include an entry with the @code{Host} and @code{User}
columns matching your computer's hostname and your MySQL username.

@item
The @code{Access denied} error message will tell you who you are trying
to log in as, the client host from which you are trying to connect, and whether
or not you were using a password. Normally, you should have one entry in
the @code{user} table that exactly matches the hostname and username
that were given in the error message. For example, if you get an error
message that contains @code{Using password: NO}, it means that you
tried to log in without an password.

@item
If the following error occurs when you try to connect from a host other than
the one on which the MySQL server is running, it means that there is no row
in the @code{user} table with a @code{Host} value that matches the client
host:

@example
Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
@end example

You can fix this by invoking the command-line tool @code{mysql} on the server
host and setting up an account for the combination of client hostname and
username that you are using when trying to connect.

If you don't know the IP number
or hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you should put
an entry with @code{'%'} as the @code{Host} column value in the @code{user}
table and restart @code{mysqld} with the @code{--log} option on the server
machine.  After trying to connect from the client machine, the information
in the MySQL log will indicate how you really did connect.  (Then replace
the @code{'%'} in the @code{user} table entry with the actual hostname
that shows up in the log.  Otherwise, you'll have a system that is insecure
because it allows connections from any host for the given username.)

On Linux, another reason that this error might occur is that you are using
a binary MySQL version that is compiled with a different version of the
@code{glibc} library than the one you are using.  In this case, you should
either upgrade your operating system or @code{glibc}, or download a source
distribution of MySQL version and compile it yourself.  A source RPM is
normally trivial to compile and install, so this isn't a big problem.

@item
If you specify a hostname when trying to connect, but get an error message
where the hostname is not shown or is an IP number,
it means that the MySQL server got an error when trying to resolve the
IP number of the client host to a name:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some-hostname ver
Access denied for user: 'root@@' (Using password: YES)
@end example

This indicates a DNS problem.  To fix it, execute @code{mysqladmin
flush-hosts} to reset the internal DNS hostname cache. @xref{DNS}.

Some permanent solutions are:

@itemize @minus
@item
Try to find out what is wrong with your DNS server and fix it.

@item
Specify IP numbers rather than hostnames in the MySQL grant tables.

@item
Put an entry for the client machine name in @code{/etc/hosts}.

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-name-resolve} option.

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-host-cache} option.

@item
On Unix, if you are running the server and the client on the same machine,
connect to @code{localhost}. Unix connections to @code{localhost} use a Unix
socket file rather than TCP/IP.

@item
On Windows, if you are running the server and the client on the same machine
and the server supports named pipe connections, connect to the hostname
@code{.} (period). Connections to @code{.} use a named pipe rather than
TCP/IP.
@end itemize

@item
If @code{mysql -u root test} works but @code{mysql -h your_hostname -u root
test} results in @code{Access denied} (where @code{your_hostname} is the
actual hostname of the local host), you may not have the correct name
for your host in the @code{user} table.  A common problem here is that the
@code{Host} value in the user table entry specifies an unqualified hostname,
but your system's name resolution routines return a fully qualified domain
name (or vice versa).  For example, if you have an entry with host
@code{'tcx'} in the @code{user} table, but your DNS tells MySQL that
your hostname is @code{'tcx.subnet.se'}, the entry will not work. Try adding
an entry to the @code{user} table that contains the IP number of your host as
the @code{Host} column value.  (Alternatively, you could add an entry to the
@code{user} table with a @code{Host} value that contains a wildcard; for
example, @code{'tcx.%'}.  However, use of hostnames ending with @samp{%} is
@strong{insecure} and is @strong{not} recommended!)

@item
If @code{mysql -u user_name test} works but @code{mysql -u user_name
other_db_name} doesn't work, you have not granted database access for
@code{other_db_name} to the given user.

@item
If @code{mysql -u user_name} works when executed on the server host, but
@code{mysql -h host_name -u user_name} doesn't work when executed on a
remote client host, you have not enabled access to the server for the given
username from the remote host.

@item
If you can't figure out why you get @code{Access denied}, remove from the
@code{user} table all entries that have @code{Host} values containing
wildcards (entries that contain @samp{%} or @samp{_}).  A very common error
is to insert a new entry with @code{Host}=@code{'%'} and
@code{User}=@code{'some user'}, thinking that this will allow you to specify
@code{localhost} to connect from the same machine.  The reason that this
doesn't work is that the default privileges include an entry with
@code{Host}=@code{'localhost'} and @code{User}=@code{''}.  Because that entry
has a @code{Host} value @code{'localhost'} that is more specific than
@code{'%'}, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from
@code{localhost}!  The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with
@code{Host}=@code{'localhost'} and @code{User}=@code{'some_user'}, or to
delete the entry with @code{Host}=@code{'localhost'} and
@code{User}=@code{''}.
After deleting the entry, remember to issue a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES}
statement to reload the grant tables.

@item
If you get the following error, you may have a problem with the @code{db} or
@code{host} table:

@example
Access to database denied
@end example

If the entry selected from the @code{db} table has an empty value in the
@code{Host} column, make sure that there are one or more corresponding entries in
the @code{host} table specifying which hosts the @code{db} table entry
applies to.

@item
If you are able to connect to the MySQL server, but get an @code{Access
denied} message whenever you issue a @code{SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE} or
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement, your entry in the @code{user} table
doesn't have the @code{FILE} privilege enabled.

@item
If you change the grant tables directly (for example, by using @code{INSERT},
@code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE} statements) and your changes seem to be
ignored, remember that you must issue a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement
or execute a @code{mysqladmin flush-privileges} command to cause the server
to reread the privilege tables. Otherwise, your changes have no effect
until the next time the server is restarted.  Remember that after you set
the @code{root} password with an @code{UPDATE} command, you won't need
to specify the new password until after you flush the privileges, because
the server won't know you've changed the password yet!

@item
If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a session, it may
be that a MySQL administrator has changed them.  Reloading the grant tables
affects new client connections, but it also affects existing connections
as indicated in @ref{Privilege changes}.

@item
If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC program, try to
connect to the server with @code{mysql -u user_name db_name} or @code{mysql
-u user_name -pyour_pass db_name}.  If you are able to connect using the
@code{mysql} client, the problem lies with your program, not with the
access privileges.  (Note that there is no space between @code{-p} and the
password; you can also use the @code{--password=your_pass} syntax to specify
the password. If you use the @code{-p} option alone, MySQL will
prompt you for the password.)

@item
For testing, start the @code{mysqld} server with the
@code{--skip-grant-tables} option.  Then you can change the MySQL
grant tables and use the @code{mysqlaccess} script to check whether
your modifications have the desired effect.  When you are satisfied with your
changes, execute @code{mysqladmin flush-privileges} to tell the @code{mysqld}
server to start using the new grant tables.  (Reloading the
grant tables overrides the @code{--skip-grant-tables} option.  This allows
you to tell the server to begin using the grant tables again without stopping
and restarting it.)

@item
If everything else fails, start the @code{mysqld} server with a debugging
option (for example, @code{--debug=d,general,query}). This will print host and
user information about attempted connections, as well as information about
each command issued. @xref{Making trace files}.

@item
If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide a
dump of the MySQL grant tables. You can dump the tables with
the @code{mysqldump mysql} command. As always, post your problem using
the @code{mysqlbug} script.  @xref{Bug reports}.  In some cases, you may need
to restart @code{mysqld} with @code{--skip-grant-tables} to run
@code{mysqldump}.

@subsection Password Hashing in MySQL 4.1

@c TODO: discuss --secure-auth option

@menu
* Application password use::    Implications of Password Hashing Changes for Application Programs
* Password hashing 4.1.0::      Password Hashing in MySQL 4.1.0
@end menu

MySQL user accounts are listed in the @code{user} table of the @code{mysql}
database. Each MySQL account is assigned a password, although
what is stored in the @code{Password} column of the @code{user} table is not the
plaintext version of the password, but a hash value computed from
it.  Password hash values are computed by the @code{PASSWORD()} function.

MySQL uses passwords in two phases of client/server communication:

@itemize @bullet

@item
When a client attempts to connect to the server, there is an initial
authentication step in which the client must present a password that has
a hash value matching the hash value stored in the @code{user} table for
the account that the client wants to use.

@item
After the client connects, it can (if it has sufficient privileges) set or
change the password hashes for accounts listed in the @code{user} table.
The client can do this by using the @code{PASSWORD()} function to generate a
password hash, or by using the @code{GRANT} or @code{SET PASSWORD}
statements.

@end itemize

In other words, the server @emph{uses} hash values during authentication when
a client first attempts to connect. The server @emph{generates} hash values
if a connected client invokes the @code{PASSWORD()} function or uses a
@code{GRANT}
or @code{SET PASSWORD} statement to set or change a password.

The password hashing mechanism was updated in MySQL 4.1 to provide
better security and to reduce the risk of passwords being intercepted.
However, this new mechanism is understood only by the 4.1 server and
4.1 clients, which can result in some compatibility problems.
A 4.1 client can connect to a pre-4.1 server, because the client
understands both the old and new password hashing mechanisms. However,
a pre-4.1 client that attempts to connect to a 4.1 server may run into
difficulties.  For example, a 4.0 @code{mysql} client that attempts to connect
to a 4.1 server may fail with the following error message:

@example
shell> mysql -h localhost -u root
Client does not support authentication protocol requested
by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
@end example

The following discussion describes the differences between the old and
new password mechanisms, and what you should do if you upgrade your
server to 4.1 but need to maintain backward compatibility with pre-4.1
clients.

@strong{Note:} This discussion contrasts 4.1 behavior with pre-4.1 behavior,
but the 4.1 behavior described here actually begins with 4.1.1. MySQL
4.1.0 is an ``odd'' release because it has a slightly different mechanism
than that implemented in 4.1.1 and up.  Differences between 4.1.0 and
more recent versions are described further in @ref{Password hashing 4.1.0}.

Prior to MySQL 4.1, password hashes computed by the @code{PASSWORD()} function
are 16 bytes long.  Such hashes look like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');
+--------------------+
| PASSWORD('mypass') |
+--------------------+
| 6f8c114b58f2ce9e   |
+--------------------+
@end example

The @code{Password} column of the @code{user} table (in which these hashes are stored)
also is 16 bytes long before MySQL 4.1.

As of MySQL 4.1, the @code{PASSWORD()} function has been modified to produce
a longer 41-byte hash value:

@example
mysql> SELECT PASSWORD('mypass');
+-----------------------------------------------+
| PASSWORD('mypass')                            |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| *43c8aa34cdc98eddd3de1fe9a9c2c2a9f92bb2098d75 |
+-----------------------------------------------+
@end example

Accordingly, the @code{Password} column in the @code{user} table also must be 41
bytes long to store these values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you perform a new installation of MySQL 4.1, the @code{Password} column
will be made 41 bytes long automatically.

@item
If you upgrade an older installation to 4.1, you should run the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script to increase the length of the
@code{Password}
column from 16 to 41 bytes. (The script does not change existing
password values, which remain 16 bytes long.)

@end itemize

A widened @code{Password} column can store password hashes in both the old and
new formats. The format of any given password hash value can be
determined two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The obvious difference is the length (16 bytes versus 41 bytes).

@item
A second difference is that password hashes in the new format always
begin with a @samp{*} character, whereas passwords in the old format never do.

@end itemize

The longer password hash format has better cryptographic properties, and
client authentication based on long hashes is more secure than that
based on the older short hashes.

The differences between short and long password hashes are relevant
both for how the server uses passwords during authentication and for
how it generates password hashes for connected clients that perform
password-changing operations.

The way in which the server uses password hashes during authentication
is affected by the width of the @code{Password} column:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If the column is short, only short-hash authentication is used.

@item
If the column is long, it can hold either short or long hashes, and
the server can use either format:

@itemize @minus

@item
Pre-4.1 clients can connect, though because they know only about
the old hashing mechanism, they can authenticate only for accounts that
have short hashes.

@item
4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long hashes.

@end itemize

@end itemize

For short-hash accounts, the authentication process is actually a bit
more secure for 4.1 clients than for older clients.  In terms of security,
the gradient from least to most secure is:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Pre-4.1 client authenticating for account with short password hash

@item
4.1 client authenticating for account with short password hash

@item
4.1 client authenticating for account with long password hash

@end itemize

The way in which the server generates password hashes for connected
clients is affected by the width of the @code{Password} column and by the
@code{--old-passwords} option.  A 4.1 server generates long hashes only if certain
conditions are met:
The @code{Password} column must be wide enough to hold long
values and the @code{--old-passwords} option must not be given.
These conditions apply as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @code{Password} column must be wide enough to hold long hashes (41 bytes).
If the column has not been updated and still has the pre-4.1 width of
16 bytes, the server notices that long hashes cannot fit into it and
generates only short hashes when a client performs password-changing
operations using @code{PASSWORD()}, @code{GRANT}, or @code{SET PASSWORD}.
This is the behavior that
occurs if you have upgraded to 4.1 but have not yet run the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script to widen the @code{Password} column.

@item
If the @code{Password} column is wide, it can store either short or long
password hashes. In this case, @code{PASSWORD()}, @code{GRANT}, and @code{SET PASSWORD}
generate long hashes unless the server was started with the
@code{--old-passwords} option. That option forces the server to generate
short passsword hashes instead.

@end itemize

The purpose of the @code{--old-passwords} option is to allow you to maintain
backward compatibility with pre-4.1 clients under circumstances where
the server would otherwise generate long password hashes. The option doesn't
affect authentication (4.1 clients can still use accounts that have
long password hashes), but it does prevent creation of a long
password hash in the @code{user} table as the result of a password-changing
operation. Were that to occur, the account no longer could be used
by pre-4.1 clients. Without the @code{--old-passwords} option, the following
undesirable scenario is possible:

@itemize @bullet

@item
An old client connects to an account that has a short password hash.

@item
The client changes its own password. Without @code{--old-passwords},
this results in the account having a long password hash.

@item
The next time the old client attempts to connect to the account, it cannot,
because the account now has a long password hash that requires the new
hashing mechanism during authentication. (Once an account has a long
password hash in the user table, only 4.1 clients can authenticate for it,
because pre-4.1 clients do not understand long hashes.)

@end itemize

This scenario illustrates that, if you must support older pre-4.1 clients,
it is dangerous to run a 4.1 server without using the @code{--old-passwords}
option.  By running the server with @code{--old-passwords}, password-changing
operations will not generate long password hashes and thus do not cause
accounts to become inaccessible to older clients. (Those clients cannot
inadvertently lock themselves out by changing their password and ending
up with a long password hash.)

The downside of the @code{--old-passwords} option is that any passwords you
create or change will use short hashes, even for 4.1 clients. Thus, you
lose the additional security provided by long password hashes. If you want
to create an account that has a long hash (for example, for use by 4.1
clients), you must do so while running the server without
@code{--old-passwords}.

The following scenarios are possible for running a 4.1 server:

@strong{Scenario 1:} Short @code{Password} column in user table:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Only short hashes can be stored in the @code{Password} column.

@item
The server uses only short hashes during client authentication.

@item
For connected clients, password hash-generating operations
involving @code{PASSWORD()}, @code{GRANT}, or @code{SET PASSWORD} use short hashes
exclusively.  Any change to an account's password results in
that account having a short password hash.

@item
The @code{--old-passwords} option can be used but is superfluous because
with a short @code{Password} column, the server will only generate short
password hashes anyway.

@end itemize

@strong{Scenario 2:} Long @code{Password} column; server not started with
@code{--old-passwords} option:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Short or long hashes can be stored in the @code{Password} column.

@item
4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long
hashes.

@item
Pre-4.1 clients can authenticate only for accounts that have short
hashes.

@item
For connected clients, password hash-generating operations involving
@code{PASSWORD()}, @code{GRANT}, or @code{SET PASSWORD} use long hashes
exclusively.  A change to an account's password results in that account
having a long password hash.

@end itemize

As indicated earlier, a danger in this scenario is that it is possible for
accounts that have a short password hash to become inaccessible to pre-4.1
clients. A change to such an account's password made via @code{GRANT},
@code{PASSWORD()}, or @code{SET PASSWORD} results in the account being
given a long password hash. From that point on, no pre-4.1 client can
authenticate to that account until the client upgrades to 4.1.

To deal with this problem, you can change a password in a special way.
For example, normally you use @code{SET PASSWORD} as follows to change
an account password:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR
    -> 'some_user'@@'some_host' = PASSWORD('mypass');
@end example

To change the password but create a short hash, use the
@code{OLD_PASSWORD()} function instead:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR
    -> 'some_user'@@'some_host' = OLD_PASSWORD('mypass');
@end example

@code{OLD_PASSWORD()} is useful for situations in which you explicitly want
to generate a short hash.

@strong{Scenario 3:} Long @code{Password} column; server started with
@code{--old-passwords} option:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Short or long hashes can be stored in the @code{Password} column.

@item
4.1 clients can authenticate for accounts that have short or long
hashes (but note that it is possible to create long hashes only when
the server is started without @code{--old-passwords}).

@item
Pre-4.1 clients can authenticate only for accounts that have short
hashes.

@item
For connected clients, password hash-generating operations
involving @code{PASSWORD()}, @code{GRANT}, or @code{SET PASSWORD} use short hashes
exclusively.  Any change to an account's password results in that
account having a short password hash.

@end itemize

In this scenario, you cannot create accounts that have long password
hashes, because the @code{--old-passwords} option prevents generation of long hashes.  Also,
if you create an account with a long hash before using the
@code{--old-passwords}
option, changing the account's password while @code{--old-passwords} is in
effect results in the account being given a short password, causing it
to lose the security benefits of a longer hash.

The disadvantages for these scenarios may be summarized as follows:

In scenario 1, you cannot take advantage of longer hashes that provide more
secure authentication.

In scenario 2, accounts with short hashes become inaccessible to pre-4.1
clients if you change their passwords without explicitly using
@code{OLD_PASSWORD()}.

In scenario 3, @code{--old-passwords} prevents accounts with short hashes from
becoming inaccessible, but password-changing operations cause accounts
with long hashes to revert to short hashes, and you cannot change them
back to long hashes while @code{--old-passwords} is in effect.

@subsubsection Implications of Password Hashing Changes for Application Programs

An upgrade to MySQL 4.1 can cause a compatibility issue for
applications that use @code{PASSWORD()} to generate passwords for their own
purposes. (Applications really should not do this, because @code{PASSWORD()}
should be used only to manage passwords for MySQL accounts. But some
applications use @code{PASSWORD()} for their own purposes anyway.)  If you upgrade to
4.1 and run the server under conditions where it generates long password
hashes, an application that uses @code{PASSWORD()} for its own passwords will
break.  The recommended course of action is to modify the application to
use another function such as @code{SHA1()} or @code{MD5()} to produce hashed values.
If that is not possible, you can use the @code{OLD_PASSWORD()} function, which
is provided to generate short hashes in the old format. (But note that
@code{OLD_PASSWORD()} may one day no longer be supported.)

If the server is running under circumstances where it generates short hashes,
@code{OLD_PASSWORD()} is available but is equivalent to @code{PASSWORD()}.

@node Password hashing 4.1.0,  , Application password use, Password hashing
@subsubsection Password Hashing in MySQL 4.1.0

Password hashing in MySQL 4.1.0 differs from hashing in 4.1.1 and up.
The 4.1.0 differences are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Password hashes are 45 bytes long rather than 41 bytes.

@item
The @code{PASSWORD()} function is non-repeatable.  That is, with a given
argument @code{X}, successive calls to @code{PASSWORD(X)} generate different
results.

@end itemize

These differences make authentication in 4.1.0 incompatible with that of
releases that follow it.  If you have upgraded to MySQL 4.1.0, it is
recommended that you upgrade to a newer version as soon as possible. After
you do, reassign any long passwords in the @code{user} table so that they are
compatible with the 41-byte format.

@cindex usernames, and passwords
@cindex passwords, for users

A MySQL account is defined in terms of a username and the client host or hosts
from which the user can connect to the server. The account also has a
password.
There are several distinctions between the way usernames and passwords are
used by MySQL and the way they are used by your operating system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Usernames, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have nothing to do
with usernames (login names) as used by Windows or Unix.  On Unix, most
MySQL clients by default try to log in using the current Unix username as
the MySQL username, but that is for convenience only. The default can be
overridden easily, because client programs allow any username to be
specified with a @code{-u} or @code{--user} option. Because this means
that anyone can attempt to connect to the server using any username, you
can't make a database secure in any way unless all MySQL accounts have
passwords.  Anyone who specifies a username for an account that
has no password will be able to connect successfully to the server.

@item
MySQL usernames can be up to 16 characters long. Operating system usernames
might have a different maximum length. For example, Unix usernames typically
are limited to eight characters.

@item
MySQL passwords have nothing to do with passwords for logging in to your
operating system.  There is no necessary connection between the password
you use to log in to a Windows or Unix machine and the password you use
to access the MySQL server on that machine.

@item
MySQL encrypts passwords using its own algorithm. This encryption is
different from that used during the Unix login process.  MySQL password
encryption is the same as that implemented by the @code{PASSWORD()} SQL
function.  Unix password encryption is the same as that implemented by the
@code{ENCRYPT()} SQL function.  See the descriptions of the
@code{PASSWORD()} and @code{ENCRYPT()} functions in @ref{Encryption
functions}.  From version 4.1 on, MySQL employs a stronger authentication
method that has better password protection during the connection process
than in earlier versions. It is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed or
the @code{mysql} database is captured.  (In earlier versions, even though
passwords are stored in encrypted form in the @code{user} table, knowledge
of the encrypted password value could be used to connect to the MySQL
server!)

@end itemize

When you install MySQL, the grant tables are populated with an initial set of
accounts. (Their names and access privileges are discussed in @ref{Default
privileges}.) Thereafter, you normally set up, modify, and remove MySQL
accounts using the @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements.
@xref{GRANT,  , @code{GRANT}}.

When you connect to a MySQL server with a command-line client, you
should specify the username and password for the account that you want to use:

@example
shell> mysql --user=monty --password=guess db_name
@end example

If you prefer short options, the command looks like this:

@example
shell> mysql -u monty -pguess db_name
@end example

Note that there must be no space between the @code{-p} option and the
following password value.
@xref{Connecting}.

If you want the client program to ask for a password, you should use
a @code{--password} or @code{-p} option without any following password value:

@example
shell> mysql --user=monty --password db_name
shell> mysql -u monty -p db_name
@end example

In these examples, @code{db_name} is @strong{not} the password.
Instead, the program will print a prompt and wait for you to enter the
password.

On some systems, the library call that MySQL uses to prompt for a
password automatically limits the password to eight characters.
Internally, MySQL doesn't have any limit for the length of the password.

Part of the MySQL installation process is to set up the @code{mysql} database
containing the grant tables:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Windows distributions contain preinitialized grant tables that are installed
automatically.
@item
On Unix, the grant tables are populated by the @code{mysql_install_db}
program. Some installation methods run this program for you. Others require
that you execute it manually. For details, see @ref{Unix post-installation}.
@end itemize

The grant tables define the initial accounts and their access privileges.
These accounts are set up as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Two accounts are created with a username of @code{root} and no
password. These are superuser accounts that can do anything.  Connections
for @code{root} must be made from the local host, either by specifying a
hostname of @code{localhost} or the actual hostname or IP number.

@strong{Note:}
The initial @code{root} account passwords are empty, so anyone can
connect to the MySQL server as @code{root} @emph{without a password} and be
granted all privileges.

@item
@cindex anonymous user
Two anonymous-user accounts are created with an empty username and no
password. These accounts can do anything with databases that have a name of
@code{'test'} or that start with @code{'test_'}.  Connections must be made
from the local host, either by specifying a hostname of @code{localhost}
or the actual hostname or IP number. Because these accounts have no
passwords, any local user can connect without a password and be treated
as the anonymous user.

@item
Other privileges are denied.  For example, normal users can't perform
administrative operations by executing commands such as
@code{mysqladmin shutdown} or @code{mysqladmin processlist}.
@end itemize

@strong{Note:} The default privileges are different for Windows.
@xref{Windows post-installation}.

As noted, none of the initial accounts have passwords.  Because your
installation is initially wide open, one of the first things you should
do is to secure these accounts:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You should assign passwords to the MySQL @code{root} accounts.

@item
If you want to prevent clients from connecting as anonymous users without a
password, you should also assign passwords to the anonymous accounts or else
remove them.

@end itemize

You can assign passwords to the @code{root} accounts several ways. The
following discussion demonstrates three methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
By using the @code{SET PASSWORD} statement
@item
By using the @code{mysqladmin} command-line client program
@item
By using the @code{UPDATE} statement
@end itemize

To assign passwords using @code{SET PASSWORD}, connect to the server as
@code{root} and issue two @code{SET PASSWORD} statements, as follows:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@@'host_name' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
@end example

Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that you
want to use.  Be sure to encrypt the password using the @code{PASSWORD()}
function.  In the second command, replace @code{host_name} with the name
of the server host.  This is the name that is specified in the @code{Host}
column of the non-@code{localhost} record for @code{root} in the @code{user}
table.  If you don't know what hostname this is, issue the following statement
before the @code{SET PASSWORD} statements:

@example
mysql> SELECT Host, User FROM User;
@end example

Look for the record that has @code{root} in the @code{User} column and
something other than @code{localhost} in the @code{Host} column.

To assign passwords to the @code{root} accounts using @code{mysqladmin},
execute the following commands:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -u root password "newpwd"
shell> mysqladmin -u root -h host_name password "newpwd"
@end example

Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that
you want to use.  The double quotes are not always necessary, but you should
use them if the password contains spaces or other characters that are special
to your command interpreter. In the second command, replace @code{host_name}
with the name of the server host.

Another way to assign passwords is by using @code{UPDATE} to modify the
@code{user} table directly. Connect to the server as @code{root} and issue an
@code{UPDATE} statement that assigns a value to the @code{Password} column
of the appropriate @code{user} table records.  The following @code{UPDATE}
statement assigns a password to both @code{root} accounts at once:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
    ->     WHERE User = 'root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that you
want to use.  Be sure to encrypt the password using the @code{PASSWORD()}
function.

Note that after you update the password in the @code{user} table directly
using @code{UPDATE}, you should tell the server to reread the grant tables
with @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES}. Otherwise, the change will go unnoticed
otherwise until you restart the server.

After the @code{root} password has been set, you must supply that
password whenever you connect to the server as @code{root}.

You might want to defer setting a password for the @code{root} accounts until
later, so that you don't need to specify it while you perform additional
setup or testing.  However, be sure to set it before using your installation
for any real production work.

If you want to assign passwords to the anonymous accounts, you can use either
@code{SET PASSWORD} or @code{UPDATE}.  In both cases, be sure to encrypt the
password using the @code{PASSWORD()} function.

To use @code{SET PASSWORD}, do this:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ''@@'host_name' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
@end example

The value of @code{host_name} is the same as when you assigned the @code{root}
account passwords.

To use @code{UPDATE}, do this:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
    ->     WHERE User = '';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

If you prefer to remove the anonymous accounts instead, do so as follows:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE User = '';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

You can create MySQL accounts two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
By using @code{GRANT} statements
@item
By manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly
@end itemize

The preferred method is to use @code{GRANT} statements, because they are
more concise and less error-prone. @code{GRANT} is available as of MySQL
3.22.11; its syntax is described in
@ref{GRANT,  , @code{GRANT}}.

Another option for creating accounts is to use one of several available
third-party programs that offer capabilities for MySQL account
administration.  @code{phpMyAdmin} is one such program.

The following examples show how to use the @code{mysql} client program to
set up new users.  These examples assume that privileges are set up
according to the defaults described in @ref{Default privileges}.  This means
that to make changes, you must be on the same machine where @code{mysqld} is
running, you must connect to it as the MySQL @code{root} user, and the
@code{root} account must have the @code{INSERT} privilege for the
@code{mysql} database and the @code{RELOAD} administrative privilege.

First, use the @code{mysql} program to connect to the server as the
MySQL @code{root} user:

@example
shell> mysql --user=root mysql
@end example

If you have assigned a password to the @code{root} account, you should
specify that password for this @code{mysql} command and also for those later
in this section.

After connecting to the server, you can add new accounts.  The following
statements use @code{GRANT} to set up four new accounts:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@@'localhost'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@@'%'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO 'admin'@@'localhost';
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'dummy'@@'localhost';
@end example

The accounts created by these @code{GRANT} statements have the
following properties:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Two of the accounts have a username of @code{monty} and a password of
@code{some_pass}. Both accounts are superuser accounts with full privileges
to do anything. One account (@code{'monty'@@'localhost'}) can be used only
when connecting from the local host. The other (@code{'monty'@@'%'}) can be
used to connect from any other host.  Note that it is necessary to have both
accounts for @code{monty} to be able to connect from anywhere as
@code{monty}.  Without the @code{localhost} account, the anonymous-user
account for @code{localhost} that is created by @code{mysql_install_db}
would take precedence when @code{monty} connects from the local host. As a
result, @code{monty} would be treated as an anonymous user.  The reason for
this is that the anonymous-user account has a more specific @code{Host}
column value than the @code{'monty'@@'%'} account and thus comes earlier in
the @code{user} table sort order.  (@code{user} table sorting is discussed
in @ref{Connection access}.)

@item
One account has a username of @code{admin} and no password.  This account
can be used only by connecting from the local host.  It is granted the
@code{RELOAD} and @code{PROCESS} administrative privileges.  These
privileges allow the @code{admin} user to execute the @code{mysqladmin
reload}, @code{mysqladmin refresh}, and @code{mysqladmin flush-*} commands,
as well as @code{mysqladmin processlist} .  No privileges are granted for
accessing any databases. You could add such privileges later by issuing
additional @code{GRANT} statements.

@item
One account has a username of @code{dummy} and no password.  This account
can be used only by connecting from the local host.  No privileges are
granted. The @code{USAGE} privilege in the @code{GRANT} statement allows you
to create an account without giving it any privileges. It has the effect of
setting all the global privileges to @code{'N'}.  It is assumed that you
will grant specific privileges to the account later.

@end itemize

@findex INSERT statement, grant privileges
@findex statements, INSERT

As an alternative to @code{GRANT}, you can create the same accounts
directly by issuing @code{INSERT} statements and then telling
the server to reload the grant tables:

@example
shell> mysql --user=root mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO user
    ->     VALUES('localhost','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    ->     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> INSERT INTO user
    ->     VALUES('%','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    ->     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> INSERT INTO user SET Host='localhost',User='admin',
    ->     Reload_priv='Y', Process_priv='Y';
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    ->     VALUES('localhost','dummy','');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

The reason for using @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} when you create accounts with
@code{INSERT} is to tell the server to reread the grant tables.
Otherwise, the changes will go unnoticed until you restart the server. (With
@code{GRANT}, @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} is unnecessary.)

The reason for using the @code{PASSWORD()} function with @code{INSERT} is to
encrypt the password. The @code{GRANT} statement encrypts the password for
you, so @code{PASSWORD()} is unnecessary.

The @code{'Y'} values enable privileges for the accounts.  Depending on your
MySQL version, you may have to use a different number of @code{'Y'} values
in the first two @code{INSERT} statements. (Versions prior to 3.22.11 have
fewer privilege columns, and versions from 4.0.2 on have more.)  For the
@code{admin} account, the more readable extended @code{INSERT} syntax using
@code{SET} that is available starting with Version 3.22.11 is used.

In the @code{INSERT} statement for the @code{dummy} account, only the
@code{Host}, @code{User}, and @code{Password} columns in the @code{user}
table record are assigned values. None of the privilege columns are set
explicitly, so MySQL assigns them all the default value of @code{'N'}.
This is equivalent to what @code{GRANT USAGE} does.

Note that to set up a superuser account, it is necessary only to create a
@code{user} table entry with the privilege columns set to @code{'Y'}.
@code{user} table privileges are global, so no entries in any of the other
grant tables are needed.

The next examples create three accounts and give them access to specific
databases. Each of them has a username of @code{custom} and password of
@code{obscure}.

To create the accounts with @code{GRANT}, use the following statements:

@example
shell> mysql --user=root mysql
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    ->     ON bankaccount.*
    ->     TO 'custom'@@'localhost'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    ->     ON expenses.*
    ->     TO 'custom'@@'whitehouse.gov'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    ->     ON customer.*
    ->     TO 'custom'@@'server.domain'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'obscure';
@end example

The three accounts can be used as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first account can
access the @code{bankaccount} database, but only from the local host.
@item
The second account can access
the @code{expenses} database, but only from the host @code{whitehouse.gov}.
@item
The third account can access
the @code{customer} database, but only from the host @code{server.domain}.
@end itemize

To set up the @code{custom} accounts without @code{GRANT}, use @code{INSERT}
statements as follows to modify the grant tables directly:

@example
shell> mysql --user=root mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    ->     VALUES('localhost','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    ->     VALUES('whitehouse.gov','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    ->     VALUES('server.domain','custom',PASSWORD('obscure'));
mysql> INSERT INTO db
    ->     (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,
    ->     Update_priv,Delete_priv,Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    ->     VALUES('localhost','bankaccount','custom',
    ->     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> INSERT INTO db
    ->     (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,
    ->     Update_priv,Delete_priv,Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    ->     VALUES('whitehouse.gov','expenses','custom',
    ->     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> INSERT INTO db
    ->     (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,
    ->     Update_priv,Delete_priv,Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    ->     VALUES('server.domain','customer','custom',
    ->     'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

The first three @code{INSERT} statements add @code{user} table entries that
allow the user @code{custom} to connect from the various hosts with the given
password, but grant no global privileges (all privileges are set to the
default value of @code{'N'}).  The next three @code{INSERT} statements add
@code{db} table entries that grant privileges to @code{custom} for the
@code{bankaccount}, @code{expenses}, and @code{customer} databases, but only
when accessed from the proper hosts.  As usual when you modify the grant
tables directly, you tell the server to reload them with
@code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} so that the privilege changes take effect.

If you want to give a specific user access from all machines in a given
domain (for example, @code{mydomain.com}), you can issue a @code{GRANT}
statement that uses the @samp{%} wildcard character in the host part of the
account name:

@example
mysql> GRANT ...
    ->     ON *.*
    ->     TO 'myname'@@'%.mydomain.com'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
@end example

To do the same thing by modifying the grant tables directly, do this:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password,...)
   ->      VALUES('%.mydomain.com','myname',PASSWORD('mypass'),...);
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

@node User resources, Passwords, Removing users, User Account Management
@subsection Limiting Account Resources

Before MySQL 4.0.2, the only available method for limiting use of MySQL
server resources has been to set the @code{max_user_connections} system
variable to a non-zero value. But that method is strictly global.  It does
not allow for management of individual accounts. Also, it limits only the
number of simultaneous connections made using a single account, not
what a client can do once connected. Both types of control are
interest to many MySQL administrators, particularly those for Internet
Service Providers.

Starting from MySQL 4.0.2, you can limit the following server resources for
individual accounts:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The number of queries that an account can issue per hour
@item
The number of updates that an account can issue per hour
@item
The number of times an account can connect to the server per hour
@end itemize

Any statement that a client can issue counts against the query limit.
Only statements that modify databases or tables count against the update
limit.

An account in this context is a single record in the @code{user} table. Each
account is uniquely identified by its @code{User} and @code{Host} column
values.

As a prerequisite for using this feature, the @code{user} table in the
@code{mysql} database must contain the resource-related columns.  Resource
limits are stored in the @code{max_questions}, @code{max_updates}, and
@code{max_connections} columns.  If your @code{user} table doesn't have
these columns, it needs to be upgraded, see @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

To set resource limits with a @code{GRANT} statement, use a @code{WITH}
clause that names each resource to be limited and a per-hour count
indicating the limit value.  For example, to create a new account that can
access the @code{customer} database but only in a limited fashion, issue
this statement:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL ON customer.* TO 'francis'@@'localhost'
    ->     IDENTIFIED BY 'frank'
    ->     WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 20
    ->          MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 10
    ->          MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 5;
@end example

The limit types need not all be named in the @code{WITH} clause, but those
named can be present in any order. The value for each limit should be an
integer representing a count per hour. If the @code{GRANT} statement has no
@code{WITH} clause, the limits are each set to the default value of zero
(that is, no limit).

To set or change limits for an existing account, use a @code{GRANT USAGE}
statement at the global level (@code{ON *.*}). The following statement
changes the query limit for @code{francis} to 100:

@example
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'francis'@@'localhost'
    ->     WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 100;
@end example

This statement leaves the account's existing privileges unchanged and
modifies only the limit values specified.

To remove an existing limit, set its value to zero. For example, to remove the
limit on how many times per hour @code{francis} can connect, use this
statement:

@example
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'francis'@@'localhost'
    ->     WITH MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0;
@end example

Resource-use counting takes place when any account has a non-zero limit
placed on its use of any of the resources.

As the server runs, it counts the number of times each account uses
resources.  If an account reaches its limit on number of connections within
the last hour, further connections for the account are rejected until that
hour is up. Similarly, if the account reaches its limit on the number of
queries or updates, further queries or updates are rejected until the hour
is up. In all such cases, an appropriate error message is issued.

Resource counting is done per account, not per client. For example, if your
account has a query limit of 50, you cannot increase your limit to 100 by
making two simultaneous client connections to the server.  Queries issued on
both connections are counted together.

The current resource-use counts can be reset globally for all accounts, or
individually for a given count:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To reset the current counts to zero for all accounts, issue a @code{FLUSH
USER_RESOURCES} statement. The counts also can be reset by reloading the
grant tables (for example, with a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement or a
@code{mysqladmin reload} command).
@item
The counts for an individual account can be set to zero by re-granting
it any of its limits. To do this, use @code{GRANT USAGE} as described earlier
and specify a limit value equal to the value that the account
already has.

@end itemize

@node Passwords, Password security, User resources, User Account Management
@subsection Assigning Account Passwords

@findex PASSWORD()
@findex SET PASSWORD statement

@cindex passwords, setting
@cindex setting, passwords

Passwords may be assigned from the command line by using the @code{mysqladmin}
command:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -u user_name -h host_name password "newpwd"
@end example

The account for which this command resets the password is the one with a
@code{user} table record that matches @code{user_name} in the @code{User}
column and the client host @emph{from which you connect} in the
@code{Host} column.

Another way to assign a password to an account is to issue a @code{SET
PASSWORD} statement:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'jeffrey'@@'%' = PASSWORD('biscuit');
@end example

Only users such as @code{root} with update access to the @code{mysql}
database can change the password for other users.  If you are not connected
as an anonymous user, you can change your own password by omitting the
@code{FOR} clause:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('biscuit');
@end example

You can also use a @code{GRANT USAGE} statement at the global level
(@code{ON *.*}) to assign a password to an account without affecting the
account's current privileges:

@example
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'jeffrey'@@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'biscuit';
@end example

Although it is generally preferable to assign passwords using one of the
preceding methods, you can also do so by modifying the @code{user} table
directly:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To establish a password when creating a new account, provide a
value for the @code{Password} column:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -> VALUES('%','jeffrey',PASSWORD('biscuit'));
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

@item
To change the password for an existing account, use @code{UPDATE} to set the
@code{Password} column value:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('bagel')
    -> WHERE Host = '%' AND User = 'francis';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

@end itemize

When you assign an account a password using @code{SET PASSWORD},
@code{INSERT}, or @code{UPDATE}, you must use the @code{PASSWORD()} function
to encrypt it.  (The only exception is that you need not use
@code{PASSWORD()} if the password is empty.) @code{PASSWORD()} is
necessary because the @code{user} table stores passwords in encrypted form,
not as plaintext.  If you forget that fact, you are likely to set passwords
like this:

@example
shell> mysql -u root mysql
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -> VALUES('%','jeffrey','biscuit');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

@c Unnecessarily complex for the explanation below, but it may be useful
@c at some point to include this elsewhere:

@c When the user @code{jeffrey} attempts to connect to the server using this
@c password, the @code{mysql} client encrypts it with @code{PASSWORD()},
@c generates an authentication vector based on @strong{encrypted} password
@c and a random number, obtained from server, and sends the result to
@c the server.

The result is that the literal value @code{'biscuit'} is stored as the
password in the @code{user} table, not the encrypted value.  When
@code{jeffrey} attempts to connect to the server using this password, the
value is encrypted and compared to the value stored in the @code{user}
table.  However, the stored value is the literal string @code{'biscuit'}, so
the comparison fails and the server rejects the connection:

@example
shell> mysql -u jeffrey -pbiscuit test
Access denied
@end example

If you set passwords using the @code{GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY} statement or
the @code{mysqladmin password} command, they both take care of encrypting
the password for you.  The @code{PASSWORD()} function is unnecessary.

@strong{Note:} @code{PASSWORD()} encryption is different from Unix password
encryption.

@subsection Keeping Your Password Secure

@c TODO: Perhaps most of this should be in Using MySQL Programs? Other than
@c the first item, it seems primarily applicable to running clients, not
@c to administering the server.  If it gets moved, be sure to retarget xrefs
@c that now point here.

On an administrative level, you should never grant access to the
@code{mysql.user} table to any non-administrative accounts. Passwords in the
@code{user} table are stored in encrypted form, but in versions of MySQL
earlier than 4.1, knowing the encrypted password for an account makes it
possible to connect to the server using that account.

When you run a client program to connect to the MySQL server, it is
inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it to discovery
by other users.  The methods you can use to specify your password when you
run client programs are listed here, along with an assessment of the risks
of each method:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex -p option
@findex --password option
Use a @code{-pyour_pass} or @code{--password=your_pass} option on the command
line.  For example:

@example
shell> mysql -u francis -pfrank db_name
@end example

This is convenient but insecure, because your password becomes visible to
system status programs such as @code{ps} that may be invoked by other users
to display command lines.  MySQL clients typically overwrite the
command-line password argument with zeros during their initialization
sequence, but there is still a brief interval during which the value is
visible.

@item
Use a @code{-p} or @code{--password} option with no password value
specified.  In this case, the client program solicits the password from
the terminal:

@example
shell> mysql -u francis
Enter password: ********
@end example

The @samp{*} characters represent your password. The password is not
displayed as you enter it.

It is more secure to enter your password this way than to specify it on the
command line because it is not visible to other users.  However, this method
of entering a password is suitable only for programs that you run
interactively.  If you want to invoke a client from a script that runs
non-interactively, there is no opportunity to enter the password from the
terminal. On some systems, you may even find that the first line of your
script is read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your password!

@item
@tindex .my.cnf file
Store your password in an option file.  For example, on Unix you can list your
password in the @code{[client]} section of the @file{.my.cnf} file in your
home directory:

@example
[client]
password=your_pass
@end example

If you store your password in @file{.my.cnf}, the file should not be
accessible to anyone but yourself. To ensure this, set the file access mode to
@code{400} or @code{600}. For example:

@example
shell> chmod 600 .my.cnf
@end example

@ref{Option files} discusses option files in more detail.

@item
Store your password in the @code{MYSQL_PWD} environment variable.
This method of specifying your MySQL password must be considered
extremely insecure and should not be used.  Some versions of @code{ps}
include an option to display the environment of running processes. If you
set @code{MYSQL_PWD}, your password will be exposed to any other user who
runs @code{ps}.  Even on systems without such a version of @code{ps}, it is
unwise to assume that there are no other methods by which users can examine
process environments.
@xref{Environment variables}.

@end itemize

All in all, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the
password or to specify the password in a properly protected option file.

@subsection Using Secure Connections

@cindex OpenSSL
@cindex SSL and X509 Basics

Beginning with version 4.0.0, MySQL has support for secure (encrypted)
connections between MySQL clients and the server using the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol.  This section discusses how to use SSL connections.
It also describes a way to set up SSH on Windows.

The standard configuration of MySQL is intended to be as fast as possible,
so encrypted connections are not used by default.  Doing so would make the
client/server protocol much slower.  Encrypting data is a CPU-intensive
operation that requires the computer to do additional work and can delay
other MySQL tasks.  For applications that require the security provided by
encrypted connections, the extra computation is warranted.

MySQL allows encryption to be enabled on a per-connection basis. You can
choose a normal uncrypted connection or a secure encrypted SSL connection
according the requirements of individual applications.

@subsubsection Basic SSL Concepts

To understand how MySQL
uses SSL, it's necessary to explain some basic SSL and X509 concepts. People
who are already familiar with them can skip this part.

By default, MySQL uses unencrypted connections between the client and the
server. This means that someone with access to the network could watch all
your traffic and look at the data being sent or received.  They could even
change the data while it is in transit between client and server. To improve
security a little, you can compress client/server traffic by using the
@code{--compress} option when invoking client programs.  However, this will
not foil a determined attacker.

@cindex What is encryption
When you need to move information over a network in a secure fashion,
an unencrypted connection is unacceptable.  Encryption is the way to make
any kind of data unreadable. In fact, today's practice requires many
additional security elements from encryption algorithms.  They should resist
many kind of known attacks such as changing the order of encrypted messages
or replaying data twice.

SSL is a protocol that uses different encryption algorithms to ensure that
data received over a public network can be trusted. It has mechanisms to
detect any data change, loss, or replay. SSL also incorporates algorithms
that provide identity verification using the X509 standard.

@cindex What is an X509/Certificate?
X509 makes it possible to identify someone on the Internet.  It is most
commonly used in e-commerce applications. In basic terms, there should be
some company called a ``Certificate Authority'' (or CA) that assigns electronic
certificates to anyone who needs them. Certificates rely on asymmetric
encryption algorithms that have two encryption keys (a public key and a
secret key). A certificate owner can show the certificate to another party
as proof of identity. A certificate consists of its owner's public key. Any
data encrypted with this public key can be decrypted only using the
corresponding secret key, which is held by the owner of the certificate.

If you need more information about SSL, X509, or encryption, use your
favorite Internet search engine to search for keywords in which you are
interested.

@node Secure requirements, Secure create certs, Secure basics, Secure connections
@subsubsection Requirements

To use SSL connections between the MySQL server and client programs, your
system must be able to support OpenSSL and your version of MySQL must be
4.0.0 or newer.

To get secure connections to work with MySQL, you must do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Install the OpenSSL library. We have tested MySQL with OpenSSL 0.9.6.
If you need OpenSSL, visit @uref{http://www.openssl.org}.
@item
When you configure MySQL, run the @code{configure} script with the
@code{--with-vio} and @code{--with-openssl} options.
@item
Make sure that you have upgraded your grant tables to include the SSL-related
columns in the @code{mysql.user} table.
This is necessary if your grant tables date from a version prior to MySQL
4.0.0.  The upgrade procedure is described in @ref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.
@item
To check whether a running @code{mysqld} server supports OpenSSL,
examine the value of the @code{have_openssl} system variable:

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_openssl';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| have_openssl  | YES   |
+---------------+-------+
@end example

If the value is @code{YES}, the server supports OpenSSL connections.

To test SSL connections, start the server as follows, where @code{$DIR} is the
pathname to the directory where the sample @file{my.cnf} option file is
located:

@example
shell> mysqld --defaults-file=$DIR/my.cnf &
@end example

Then invoke a client program using the same option file:

@example
shell> mysql --defaults-file=$DIR/my.cnf
@end example

If you have a MySQL source distribution, you can also test your setup by
modifying the preceding @file{my.cnf} file to refer to the demonstration
certificate and key files in the @file{SSL} directory of the distribution.


@node Secure GRANT, SSL options, Secure create certs, Secure connections
@subsubsection SSL @code{GRANT} Options

@cindex SSL related options
@findex REQUIRE GRANT option
@findex GRANT statement

MySQL can check X509 certificate attributes in addition to the usual
authentication that is based on the username and password.  To specify
SSL-related options for a MySQL account, use the @code{REQUIRE} clause of
the @code{GRANT} statement.

There are different possibilities for limiting connection types for an account:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If an account has no SSL or X509 requirements, unencrypted connections are
allowed if the username and password are valid. However, encrypted
connections also can be used at the client's option, if the client has the
proper certificate and key files.

@item
@code{REQUIRE SSL} option limits the server to allow only SSL
encrypted connections for the account. Note that this option can be omitted
if there are any ACL records that allow non-SSL connections.

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret' REQUIRE SSL;
@end example

@item
@code{REQUIRE X509} means that the client must have a valid certificate
but that the exact certificate, issuer, and subject do not matter.
The only requirement is that it should be possible to verify its
signature with one of the CA certificates.

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret' REQUIRE X509;
@end example

@item
@code{REQUIRE ISSUER 'issuer'} places the restriction on connection attempts
that the client must present a valid X509 certificate issued by CA
@code{'issuer'}.  If the client presents a certificate that is valid but has
a different issuer, the server rejects the connection.  Use of X509
certificates always implies encryption, so the @code{SSL} option is
unneccessary.

@c TODO: isn't preceding sentence also true for X509, SUBJECT, and CIPHER?

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret'
    -> REQUIRE ISSUER '/C=FI/ST=Some-State/L=Helsinki/
       O=MySQL Finland AB/CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@@example.com';
@end example

Note that the @code{ISSUER} value should be entered as a single string.

@item
@code{REQUIRE SUBJECT 'subject'} places the restriction on connection
attempts that the client must present a valid X509 certificate with subject
@code{'subject'} on it.  If the client presents a certificate that is valid
but has a different subject, the server rejects the connection.

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret'
    -> REQUIRE SUBJECT '/C=EE/ST=Some-State/L=Tallinn/
       O=MySQL demo client certificate/
       CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@@example.com';
@end example

Note that the @code{SUBJECT} value should be entered as a single string.

@item
@code{REQUIRE CIPHER 'cipher'} is needed to ensure that strong enough ciphers
and key lengths will be used. SSL itself can be weak if old algorithms
with short encryption keys are used. Using this option, we can ask for
some exact cipher method to allow a connection.

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret'
    -> REQUIRE CIPHER 'EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA';
@end example

@end itemize

The @code{SUBJECT}, @code{ISSUER}, and @code{CIPHER} options can be
combined in the @code{REQUIRE} clause like this:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO 'root'@@'localhost'
    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'goodsecret'
    -> REQUIRE SUBJECT '/C=EE/ST=Some-State/L=Tallinn/
       O=MySQL demo client certificate/
       CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@@example.com'
    -> AND ISSUER '/C=FI/ST=Some-State/L=Helsinki/
       O=MySQL Finland AB/CN=Tonu Samuel/Email=tonu@@example.com'
    -> AND CIPHER 'EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA';
@end example

Note that the @code{SUBJECT} and @code{ISSUER} values each should be entered
as a single string.

Starting from MySQL 4.0.4, the @code{AND} keyword is optional between
@code{REQUIRE} options.

The order of the options does not matter, but no option can be specified
twice.


@node SSL options, Windows and SSH, Secure GRANT, Secure connections
@subsubsection SSL Command-Line Options

@cindex SSL command-line options

The following list describes options that are used for specifying the
use of SSL, certificate files, and key files.
These options are available beginning with MySQL 4.0. They may
be given on the command line or in an option file.

@table @code

@item --ssl
For the server, this option specifies that the server allows SSL connections.
For a client program, it allows the client to connect to the server using SSL.
This option is not sufficient in itself to cause an SSL connection to be used.
You must also specify the
@code{--ssl-ca}, @code{--ssl-cert}, and @code{--ssl-key} options.

This option is more often used in its opposite form to indicate that SSL
should @strong{not} be used. To do this, specify the option as
@code{--skip-ssl} or @code{--ssl=0}.

Note that use of @code{--ssl} doesn't @strong{require} an SSL connection.
For example, if the server or client are compiled without SSL support,
a normal unencrypted connection will be used.

The secure way to ensure that a SSL connection will be used is
to create an account on the server that includes a
@code{REQUIRE SSL} clause in the @code{GRANT} statement.
Then use this account to connect to the server, with both a server and client
that have SSL support enabled.

@item --ssl-ca=file_name
The path to a file with a list of trusted SSL CAs.

@item --ssl-capath=directory_name
The path to a directory that contains trusted 
SSL CA certificates in pem format.

@item --ssl-cert=file_name
The name of the SSL certificate file to use
for establishing a secure connection.

@item --ssl-cipher=cipher_list
A list of allowable ciphers to use for SSL encryption.
@code{cipher_list} has the same format as the @code{openssl ciphers}
command.

Example: @code{--ssl-cipher=ALL:-AES:-EXP}

@item --ssl-key=file_name
The name of the SSL key file to use
for establishing a secure connection.

Here is a note about how to connect to get a secure connection to remote
MySQL server with SSH (by David Carlson @email{dcarlson@@mplcomm.com}):

@enumerate
@item
@c URLs last verified: 2003-11-15
Install an SSH client on your Windows machine.  As a user, the best non-free
one I've found is from @code{SecureCRT} from @uref{http://www.vandyke.com/}.
Another option is @code{f-secure} from @uref{http://www.f-secure.com/}. You
can also find some free ones on @code{Google} at
@uref{http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/}.

@item
Start your Windows SSH client.
Set @code{Host_Name = yourmysqlserver_URL_or_IP}.
Set @code{userid=your_userid} to log in to your server. This @code{userid}
value may not be the same as the username of your MySQL account.

@item
Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (Set @code{local_port: 3306}, @code{remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip}, @code{remote_port: 3306} )
or a local forward (Set @code{port: 3306},  @code{host: localhost}, @code{remote port: 3306}).

@item
Save everything, otherwise you'll have to redo it the next time.

@item
Log in to your server with the SSH session you just created.

@item
On your Windows machine, start some ODBC application (such as Access).

@item
Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC
driver the same way you normally do, except type in @code{localhost}
for the MySQL host server---not @code{yourmysqlservername}.
@end enumerate

You should now have an ODBC connection to MySQL, encrypted using SSH.

@subsection Database Backups

@cindex databases, backups
@cindex backups

Because MySQL tables are stored as files, it is easy to do a
backup. To get a consistent backup, do a @code{LOCK TABLES} on the
relevant tables, followed by @code{FLUSH TABLES} for the tables.
@xref{LOCK TABLES, , @code{LOCK TABLES}}.
@xref{FLUSH, , @code{FLUSH}}.
You only need a read lock; this allows other clients to continue to
query the tables while you are making a copy of the files in the
database directory.  The @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement is needed to ensure that
the all active index pages are written to disk before you start the backup.


If you want to make an SQL level backup of a table, you can use
@code{SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE} or @code{BACKUP TABLE}.
For @code{SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE}, the output file cannot already exist.
For @code{BACKUP TABLE}, the same is true as of
MySQL 3.23.56 and 4.0.12, because this would be a security risk.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.
@xref{BACKUP TABLE,  , @code{BACKUP TABLE}}.

Another way to back up a database is to use the @code{mysqldump} program or
the @code{mysqlhotcopy script}. @xref{mysqldump, , @code{mysqldump}}.
@xref{mysqlhotcopy, , @code{mysqlhotcopy}}.

@enumerate
@item
Do a full backup of your database:

@example
shell> mysqldump --tab=/path/to/some/dir --opt db_name
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name /path/to/some/dir
@end example

You can also simply copy all table files (@file{*.frm}, @file{*.MYD}, and
@file{*.MYI} files) as long as the server isn't updating anything.
The @code{mysqlhotcopy} script uses this method.  (But note that these
methods
will not work if your database contains @code{InnoDB} tables.  @code{InnoDB}
does not store table contents in database directories, and @code{mysqlhotcopy}
works only for @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables.)

@item
@cindex log files, names
Stop @code{mysqld} if it's running, then start it with the
@code{--log-bin[=file_name]} option.  @xref{Binary log}. The binary
log files provide you with the information you need to replicate
changes to the database that are made subsequent to the point at which
you executed @code{mysqldump}.
@end enumerate

If your MySQL server is a slave replication server, then regardless of the
backup method you choose, you should also backup the
@file{master.info} and @file{relay-log.info} files
when you backup your slave's data. These files
are always needed to resume replication after you restore
the slave's data. If your slave is subject to replicating @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} commands, you should also back up any @file{SQL_LOAD-*} files
that may exist in the directory specified by the @code{--slave-load-tmpdir}
option. (This location defaults to the value of the @code{tmpdir} variable
if not specified.) The slave needs these files to resume
replication of any interrupted @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operations. 

If you have to restore something, try to recover your tables using
@code{REPAIR TABLE} or @code{myisamchk -r} first.  That should work in
99.9% of all cases.  If @code{myisamchk} fails, try the following procedure.
Note that it will work only if you have enabled binary logging by starting
MySQL with the @code{--log-bin} option; see @ref{Binary log}.

@enumerate
@item
Restore the original @code{mysqldump} backup, or binary backup.
@item
Execute the following command to re-run the updates in the binary logs:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql
@end example

In your case you may want to re-run only certain binary logs, from
certain positions (usually you want to re-run all binary logs from the
date of the restored backup, excepting possibly some incorrect queries).
See @ref{mysqlbinlog,  , @code{mysqlbinlog}} for more information on
the @code{mysqlbinlog} utility and how to use it.

If you are using the update logs instead,
you can process their contents like this:

@example
shell> ls -1 -t -r hostname.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
@end example

@code{ls} is used to sort the update log filenames into the right order.

@end enumerate

You can also do selective backups of individual files:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To dump the table, use
@code{SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'file_name' FROM tbl_name}.

@item
To reload the table, use and restore with
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' REPLACE ...}
To avoid duplicate records, the table must have a @code{PRIMARY KEY} or a
@code{UNIQUE} index. The @code{REPLACE} keyword causes old records
to be replaced with new ones when a new record duplicates an old record on
a unique key value.

@end itemize

If you have performance problems with your server while making backups, one
strategy that can help is to set up replication and perform backups on the
slave rather than on the master.
@xref{Replication Intro}.

If you are using a Veritas filesystem, you can make a backup like this:

@enumerate
@item
From a client program, execute: @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK}.

@item
From another shell, execute: @code{mount vxfs snapshot}.

@item
From the first client, execute: @code{UNLOCK TABLES}.

@item
Copy files from the snapshot.

@item
Unmount the snapshot.

@subsection Using @code{myisamchk} for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery


The following text discusses how to use @code{myisamchk} to check or repair
@code{MyISAM} tables (tables with @file{.MYI} and @file{.MYD} files).
The same concepts apply to using @code{isamchk} to check or repair
@code{ISAM} tables (tables with @file{.ISM} and @file{.ISD} files).
@xref{Table types}.

You can use the @code{myisamchk} utility to get information about your
database tables or to check, repair, or optimize them.  The following
sections describe how to invoke @code{myisamchk} (including a
description of its options), how to set up a table maintenance schedule,
and how to use @code{myisamchk} to perform its various functions.

Note that even though table repair with @code{myisamchk} is quite secure, it's
always a good idea to make a backup @emph{before} doing a repair (or any
maintenance operation that could make a lot of changes to a table)

Note that @code{myisamchk} operations that affect indexes can cause
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes to be rebuilt will full-text parameters that
are incompatible with the values used by the MySQL server. To avoid this,
read the instructions in
@ref{myisamchk general options,  , @code{myisamchk} general options}.

An alternative to using @code{myisamchk} for checking or repairing
@code{MyISAM} tables is to use the @code{CHECK TABLE} or @code{REPAIR TABLE}
statements, which are available as of MySQL 3.23.13.
See @ref{CHECK TABLE,  , @code{CHECK TABLE}} and @ref{REPAIR TABLE,  ,
@code{REPAIR TABLE}}.

In most cases, you can also use the @code{OPTIMIZE TABLES} statement to
optimize and repair tables, but this is not as fast or reliable (in case
of really serious problems) as @code{myisamchk}.  On the other hand,
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} is easier to use and you don't have to worry about
flushing tables.
@xref{OPTIMIZE TABLE, , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}}.

The @code{mysqlcheck} client program provides a command-line interface to the
@code{CHECK TABLE}, @code{REPAIR TABLE}, and @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} statements.

@node myisamchk syntax, myisamchk general options, Table maintenance, Table maintenance
@subsubsection @code{myisamchk} Invocation Syntax

Invoke @code{myisamchk} like this:

@example
shell> myisamchk [options] tbl_name
@end example

The @code{options} specify what you want @code{myisamchk} to do.  They are
described in the following sections.  You can also get a list of options by
invoking @code{myisamchk --help}.

With no options, @code{myisamchk} simply checks your table as the default
operation.  To get more information or to tell @code{myisamchk} to take
corrective action, specify options as described in the following discussion.

@code{tbl_name} is the database table you want to check or repair.  If you run
@code{myisamchk} somewhere other than in the database directory, you must
specify the path to the database directory, because @code{myisamchk} has no
idea where the
database is located.  In fact @code{myisamchk} doesn't actually care whether
the files you are working on are located in a database directory. You can
copy the files that correspond to a database table into some other location and
perform recovery operations on them there.

You can name several tables on the @code{myisamchk} command line if you
wish.  You can also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with
the @file{.MYI} suffix). This allows you to specify all tables in a
directory by using the pattern @file{*.MYI}.  For example, if you are in a
database directory, you can check all the @code{MyISAM} tables in that
directory like this:

@example
shell> myisamchk *.MYI
@end example

If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables there
by specifying the path to the directory:

@example
shell> myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
@end example

You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wildcard
with the path to the MySQL data directory:

@example
shell> myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
@end example

The recommended way to quickly check all @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM}
tables is:

@example
shell> myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
shell> isamchk --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
@end example

If you want to check all @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables and repair any
that are corrupted, you can use the following commands:

@example
shell> myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state \
          -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M \
          -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M \
          /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
shell> isamchk --silent --force -O key_buffer=64M \
          -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M \
          /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
@end example

These commands assume that you have more than 64MB free.
For more information about memory allocation with @code{myisamchk}, see
@ref{myisamchk memory}.

You must ensure that no other program is using the tables while you are
running @code{myisamchk}.

When you run @code{myisamchk}, it may display the following error message:

@example
warning: clients are using or haven't closed the table properly
@end example

This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by
another program (like the @code{mysqld} server) that hasn't yet closed
the file or that has died without closing the file properly.

If @code{mysqld} is running, you must force it to flush any table
modifications that are still buffered in memory by using @code{FLUSH
TABLES}. You should then ensure that no one is using the tables while you
are running @code{myisamchk}.  In MySQL Version 3.23, the easiest way to
avoid this problem is to use @code{CHECK TABLE} instead of @code{myisamchk}
to check tables.

@node myisamchk general options, myisamchk check options, myisamchk syntax, Table maintenance
@subsubsection General Options for @code{myisamchk}

@cindex options, @code{myisamchk}
@cindex @code{myisamchk}, options

The options described in this section can be used for any
type of table maintenance operation performed by @code{myisamchk}.
The sections following this one describe options that pertain only to specific
operations, such as table checking or repairing.

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --debug=debug_options, -# debug_options
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --silent, -s
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur. You can use @code{-s}
twice (@code{-ss}) to make @code{myisamchk} very silent.

@item --verbose, -v
Verbose mode.  Print more information. This can be used with @code{-d} and
@code{-e}. Use @code{-v} multiple times (@code{-vv}, @code{-vvv}) for even
more output.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.

@item --wait, -w
Instead of terminating with an error if the table is locked, wait until the
table is unlocked before continuing.  Note that if you are running
@code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-external-locking} option, the table can
only be locked by another @code{myisamchk} command.

@end table

You can also set the following variables by using @code{--var_name=value}
options:

@cindex @code{decode_bits} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{ft_max_word_len} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{ft_min_word_len} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{ft_stopword_file} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{key_buffer_size} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{myisam_block_size} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{read_buffer_size} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{sort_buffer_size} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{sort_key_blocks} @code{myisamchk} variable
@cindex @code{write_buffer_size} @code{myisamchk} variable

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .10
@item @strong{Variable} @tab @strong{Default Value}
@item @code{decode_bits} @tab 9
@item @code{ft_max_word_len} @tab version-dependent

@item @code{ft_stopword_file} @tab built-in list
@item @code{key_buffer_size} @tab 523264

@item @code{read_buffer_size} @tab 262136
@item @code{sort_buffer_size} @tab 2097144
@item @code{sort_key_blocks} @tab 16
@item @code{write_buffer_size} @tab 262136
@end multitable

It is also possible to set variables by using
@code{--set-variable=var_name=value} or @code{-O var_name=value}
syntax. However, this syntax is deprecated as of MySQL 4.0.

The possible @code{myisamchk} variables and their default values
can be examined with @code{myisamchk --help}:

@code{sort_buffer_size} is used when the keys are repaired by sorting
keys, which is the normal case when you use @code{--recover}.

@code{key_buffer_size} is used when you are checking the table with
@code{--extend-check} or when the keys are repaired by inserting keys
row by row into the table (like when doing normal inserts). Repairing
through the key buffer is used in the following cases:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you use @code{--safe-recover}.

@item
If the temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice as
big as when creating the key file directly.  This is often the case when you
have large key values for  @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, or @code{TEXT}
columns, because the sort operation needs to store the complete key values
as it proceeds. If you have lots of temporary space and you can force
@code{myisamchk} to repair by sorting, you can use the @code{--sort-recover}
option.

@end itemize

Repairing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using
sorting, but is also much slower.

If you want a faster repair, set the @code{key_buffer_size} and
@code{sort_buffer_size} variables to about 25% of your available memory.
You can set both variables to large values, because only one of them is used
at a time.

The @code{ft_min_word_len}, @code{ft_max_word_len}, and
@code{myisam_block_size} variables are available as of MySQL 4.0.0.
@code{ft_stopword_file} is available as of MySQL 4.0.19.

@code{myisam_block_size} is the size used for index blocks.

@code{ft_min_word_len} and @code{ft_max_word_len} indicate the minimum and
maximum word length for @code{FULLTEXT} indexes. @code{ft_stopword_file}
names the stopword file. These need to be set under the following
circumstances.

If you use @code{myisamchk} to perform an operation that modifies
table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
are rebuilt using the default full-text parameter values for minimum and
maximum word length and the stopword file unless you specify otherwise.
This can result in queries failing.

The problem occurs because these parameters are known only by the server.
They are not stored in @code{MyISAM} index files.  To avoid the problem if
you have modified the minimum or maximum word length or the stopword file in
the server, specify the same @code{ft_min_word_len}, @code{ft_max_word_len},
and @code{ft_stopword_file} values to @code{myisamchk} that you use for
@code{mysqld}. For example, if you have set the minimum word length to 3,
you can repair a table with @code{myisamchk} like this:

@example
shell> myisamchk --recover --ft_min_word_len=3 tbl_name.MYI
@end example

To ensure that @code{myisamchk} and the server use the same values for
full-text parameters, you can place each one in both the @code{[mysqld]}
and @code{[myisamchk]} sections of an option file:

@example
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3

[myisamchk]
ft_min_word_len=3
@end example

An alternative to using @code{myisamchk} is to use the @code{REPAIR TABLE},
@code{ANALYZE TABLE}, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}, or @code{ALTER TABLE}.
These statements are performed by the server, which knows the proper
full-text parameter values to use.


@node myisamchk check options, myisamchk repair options, myisamchk general options, Table maintenance
@subsubsection Check Options for @code{myisamchk}

@cindex check options, myisamchk
@cindex tables, checking

@code{myisamchk} supports the following options for table checking operations:

@table @code

@item --check, -c
Check the table for errors. This is the default operation if you specify no
option that selects an operation type explicitly.

@item --check-only-changed, -C
Check only tables that have changed since the last check.

@item --extend-check, -e
Check the table very thoroughly. This is quite slow if the table has many
indexes.  This option should only be used in extreme cases.  Normally,
@code{myisamchk} or @code{myisamchk --medium-check} should
be able to determine whether there are any errors in the table.

If you are using @code{--extend-check} and have plenty of memory, setting
the @code{key_buffer_size} variable to a large value will help the repair
operation run faster.

@item --fast, -F
Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.

@item --force, -f
Do a repair operation automatically if
@code{myisamchk} finds any errors in the table.
The repair type is the same as that specified with the @code{--repair} or
@code{-r} option.

@item --information, -i
Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.

@item --medium-check, -m
Do a check that is faster than an @code{--extend-check} operation.
This finds only 99.99% of all errors, which should be good enough in most cases.

@item --read-only, -T
Don't mark the table as checked. This is useful if you use @code{myisamchk}
to check a table that is in use by some other application that doesn't
use locking, such as @code{mysqld} when run with the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option.

@item --update-state, -U
Store information in the @file{.MYI} file to indicate when the table was
checked and whether the table crashed.  This should be used to get full benefit of the
@code{--check-only-changed} option, but you shouldn't use this
option if the @code{mysqld} server is using the table and you are
running it with the @code{--skip-external-locking} option.

@end table


@node myisamchk repair options, myisamchk other options, myisamchk check options, Table maintenance
@subsubsection Repair Options for @code{myisamchk}

@cindex repair options, myisamchk
@cindex files, repairing

@code{myisamchk} supports the following options for table repair operations:

@table @code
@item --backup, -B
Make a backup of the @file{.MYD} file as @file{filename-time.BAK}

@item --character-sets-dir=path
The directory where character sets are installed.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --correct-checksum
Correct the checksum information for the table.

@item --data-file-length=#, -D #
Maximum length of the data file (when re-creating data file when it's ``full'').

@item --extend-check, -e
Do a repair that tries to
to recover every possible row from the data file.
Normally this will also find a lot of garbage rows. Don't use this option
unless you are totally desperate.

@item --force, -f
Overwrite old temporary files (files with names like @file{tbl_name.TMD})
instead of aborting.

@item --keys-used=#, -k #
For @code{myisamchk}, the option value indicates which indexes to update.
Each binary bit of the option value corresponds to a table index, where the
first index is bit 0.
For @code{isamchk}, the option value indicates that only the first @code{#} of
the table indexes should be updated.
In either case, an option value of 0 disables updates to all indexes, which
can be used to get faster inserts.
Deactivated indexes can be reactivated by using @code{myisamchk -r}
or (@code{isamchk -r}).

@item --no-symlinks, -l
Do not follow symbolic links. Normally @code{myisamchk} repairs the
table a symlink points to.  This option doesn't exist as of MySQL 4.0,
because versions from 4.0 on will not remove symlinks during repair operations.

@item --parallel-recover, -p
Uses the same technique as @code{-r} and @code{-n}, but creates
all the keys in parallel, using different threads.
This option was added in MySQL 4.0.2.
@strong{This is alpha code. Use at your own risk!}

@item --quick, -q
Achieve a faster repair by not modifying the data file. You can specify this
option twice to force @code{myisamchk} to modify the original data file in
case of duplicate keys.

@item --recover, -r
Do a repair that can fix almost any problem except unique keys that aren't
unique (which is an extremely unlikely error with @code{ISAM}/@code{MyISAM}
tables).  If you want to recover a table, this is the option to try
first. You should try @code{-o} only if @code{myisamchk} reports that the
table can't be recovered by @code{-r}.  (Note that in the unlikely case
that @code{-r} fails, the data file is still intact.)

If you have lots of memory, you should increase the value of
@code{sort_buffer_size}.

@item --safe-recover, -o
Do a repair using
an old recovery method that reads through all rows in order and updates
all index trees based on the rows found.  This is an order of magnitude
slower than @code{-r}, but can handle a couple of very unlikely cases that
@code{-r} cannot.  This recovery method also uses much less disk
space than @code{-r}. Normally, you should repair first with
@code{-r}, and then with @code{-o} only if @code{-r} fails.

If you have lots of memory, you should increase the value of
@code{key_buffer_size}.

@item --set-character-set=name
Change the character set used by the table indexes.

@item --sort-recover, -n
Force @code{myisamchk} to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the
temporary files should be very big.

@item --tmpdir=path, -t path
Path of the directory to be used for storing temporary files. If this is not
set, @code{myisamchk} uses the value of the @code{TMPDIR} environment variable.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, @code{tmpdir} can be set to a list of directory paths
that will be used successively in in round-robin fashion for creating
temporary files. The separator character between directory names should be
colon (@samp{:}) on Unix and semicolon (@samp{;}) on Windows, NetWare, and
OS/2.

@item --unpack, -u
Unpack a table that was packed with @code{myisampack}.
@end table


@node myisamchk other options, myisamchk memory, myisamchk repair options, Table maintenance
@subsubsection Other Options for @code{myisamchk}

@code{myisamchk} supports the following options for actions other than
table checks and repairs:

@table @code
@item --analyze, -a
Analyze the distribution of keys. This improves join performance by enabling
the join optimizer to better choose the order in which to join the tables
and which keys it should use. To obtain information about the distribution,
use a @code{myisamchk --description --verbose tbl_name} command or the
@code{SHOW KEYS FROM tbl_name} statement.

@item --description, -d
Prints some descriptive information about the table.

@item --set-auto-increment[=value], -A[value]
Force @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} numbering for new records to start at the given
value (or higher, if there are already records with @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
values this large). If @code{value} is not specified, @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
number for new records begins with the largest value currently in the table,
plus one.

@item --sort-index, -S
Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order.
This optimizes seeks and makes table scanning by key faster.

@item --sort-records=#, -R #
Sorts records according to a particular index.  This makes your data much
more localized and may speed up range-based @code{SELECT} and @code{ORDER
BY} operations that use this index. (The first time you use this option to
sort a table, it may be very slow.) To determine a table's index numbers,
use @code{SHOW KEYS}, which displays a table's indexes in the same order
that @code{myisamchk} sees them.  Indexes are numbered beginning with 1.

@end table


@node myisamchk memory, Crash recovery, myisamchk other options, Table maintenance
@subsubsection @code{myisamchk} Memory Usage

@cindex memory usage, myisamchk

Memory allocation is important when you run @code{myisamchk}.
@code{myisamchk} uses no more memory than you specify with the @code{-O}
options.  If you are going to use @code{myisamchk} on very large tables,
you should first decide how much memory you want it to use.  The default
is to use only about 3MB to perform repairs.  By using larger values, you can
get @code{myisamchk} to operate faster.  For example, if you have more
than 32MB RAM, you could use options such as these (in addition to any
other options you might specify):

@example
shell> myisamchk -O sort=16M -O key=16M -O read=1M -O write=1M ...
@end example

Using @code{-O sort=16M} should probably be enough for most cases.

Be aware that @code{myisamchk} uses temporary files in @code{TMPDIR}. If
@code{TMPDIR} points to a memory filesystem, you may easily get out of
memory errors. If this happens, set @code{TMPDIR} to point at some directory
located on a filesystem
with more space and run @code{myisamchk} again.

When repairing, @code{myisamchk} will also need a lot of disk space:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Double the size of the record file (the original one and a copy).  This
space is not needed if you do a repair with @code{--quick}; in this
case, only the index file is re-created.  This space is needed on the same
filesystem as the original record file! (The copy is created in the
same directory as the original.)

@item
Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old index file
is truncated at the start of the repair operation, so you usually ignore
this space.  This space is needed on the same filesystem as the original
index file!

@item
When using @code{--recover} or @code{--sort-recover}
(but not when using @code{--safe-recover}), you will need space for a
sort buffer. The amount of space required is:

@example
(largest_key + row_pointer_length) * number_of_rows * 2
@end example

You can check the length of the keys and the @code{row_pointer_length}
with @code{myisamchk -dv tbl_name}.  This space is allocated in the temporary
directory (specified by @code{TMPDIR} or @code{--tmpdir=#}).

@end itemize

If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try to use
@code{--safe-recover} instead of @code{--recover}.


@node Crash recovery, Check, myisamchk memory, Table maintenance
@subsubsection Using @code{myisamchk} for Crash Recovery

@cindex crash, recovery
@cindex recovery, from crash

If you run @code{mysqld} with @code{--skip-external-locking} (which is the
default on some systems, like Linux), you can't reliably use @code{myisamchk}
to check a table when @code{mysqld} is using the same table.  If you
can be sure that no one is accessing the tables through @code{mysqld}
while you run @code{myisamchk}, you only have to do @code{mysqladmin
flush-tables} before you start checking the tables.  If you can't
guarantee this, then you must stop @code{mysqld} while you
check the tables.  If you run @code{myisamchk} while @code{mysqld} is updating
the tables, you may get a warning that a table is corrupt even when it
isn't.

If you are not using @code{--skip-external-locking}, you can use
@code{myisamchk} to check tables at any time.  While you do this, all clients
that try to update the table will wait until @code{myisamchk} is ready before
continuing.

If you use @code{myisamchk} to repair or optimize tables, you
@strong{must} always ensure that the @code{mysqld} server is not using
the table (this also applies if you are using @code{--skip-external-locking}).
If you don't take down @code{mysqld} you should at least do a
@code{mysqladmin flush-tables} before you run @code{myisamchk}.
Your tables @strong{may become corrupted} if the server and @code{myisamchk}
access the tables simultaneously.

This section describes how to check for and deal with data corruption
in MySQL databases.  If your tables get corrupted frequently you should
try to find the reason why.
@xref{Crashing}.

The @code{MyISAM} table section contains reason for why a table could be
corrupted. @xref{MyISAM table problems,  , @code{MyISAM} table problems}.

When performing crash recovery, it is important to understand that each table
@code{tbl_name} in a database corresponds to three files in the database
directory:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .40
@item @strong{File} @tab @strong{Purpose}
@item @file{tbl_name.frm} @tab Definition (format) file
@item @file{tbl_name.MYD} @tab Data file
@item @file{tbl_name.MYI} @tab Index file
@end multitable

Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various ways, but
problems occur most often in data files and index files.

@code{myisamchk} works by creating a copy of the @file{.MYD} data file
row by row. It ends the repair stage by removing the old @file{.MYD}
file and renaming the new file to the original file name.  If you use
@code{--quick}, @code{myisamchk} does not create a temporary @file{.MYD}
file, but instead assumes that the @file{.MYD} file is correct and only
generates a new index file without touching the @file{.MYD} file. This is
safe, because @code{myisamchk} automatically detects whether the @file{.MYD}
file is corrupt and aborts the repair if it is.  You can also specify
the @code{--quick} option twice to @code{myisamchk}.  In this case,
@code{myisamchk} does not abort on some errors (such as duplicate-key
errors) but instead tries to resolve them by modifying the @file{.MYD}
file. Normally the use of two @code{--quick} options is useful only if you
have too little free disk space to perform a normal repair.  In this case,
you should at least make a backup before running @code{myisamchk}.

@subsubsection How to Check @code{MyISAM} Tables for Errors

@cindex checking, tables for errors
@cindex tables, error checking
@cindex errors, checking tables for

To check a @code{MyISAM} table, use the following commands:

@table @code
@item myisamchk tbl_name
This finds 99.99% of all errors. What it can't find is corruption that
involves @strong{only} the data file (which is very unusual). If you want
to check a table, you should normally run @code{myisamchk} without options or
with either the @code{-s} or @code{--silent} option.

@item myisamchk -m tbl_name
This finds 99.999% of all errors. It first checks all index entries for
errors and then reads through all rows. It calculates a checksum for
all keys in the rows and verifies that the checksum matches the checksum
for the keys in the index tree.

@item myisamchk -e tbl_name
This does a complete and thorough check of all data (@code{-e} means
``extended check''). It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify
that they indeed point to the correct row.  This may take a long time for a
large table that has many indexes.  Normally, @code{myisamchk} stops after
the first error it finds. If you want to obtain more information, you can
add the @code{--verbose} (@code{-v}) option.  This causes @code{myisamchk}
to keep going, up through a maximum of 20 errors.

@item myisamchk -e -i tbl_name
Like the previous command, but the @code{-i} option tells @code{myisamchk} to
print some informational statistics, too.

@end table

In most cases, a simple @code{myisamchk} with no arguments other than the
table name is sufficient to check a table.

@subsubsection How to Repair Tables

@cindex tables, repairing
@cindex repairing, tables

The discussion in this section describes how to use @code{myisamchk} on
@code{MyISAM} tables (extensions @file{.MYI} and @file{.MYD}).  If you
are using @code{ISAM} tables (extensions @file{.ISM} and @file{.ISD}),
you should use @code{isamchk} instead; the concepts are similar.

Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.14, you can repair @code{MyISAM}
tables with the @code{REPAIR TABLE} command.
@xref{REPAIR TABLE,  , @code{REPAIR TABLE}}.

The symptoms of a corrupted table include queries that abort unexpectedly
and observable errors such as these:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{tbl_name.frm} is locked against change
@item
Can't find file @file{tbl_name.MYI} (Errcode: ###)
@item
Unexpected end of file
@item
Record file is crashed
@item
Got error ### from table handler
@end itemize

To get more information about the error you can run @code{perror ###},
where @code{###} is the error number. The following example shows how to use
@code{perror} to find the meanings for the most common error numbers that
indicate a problem with a table:

@example
shell> perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
126 = Index file is crashed / Wrong file format
127 = Record-file is crashed
132 = Old database file
134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
135 = No more room in record file
136 = No more room in index file
141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
@end example

Note that error 135 (no more room in record file), is not an error that
can be fixed by a simple repair. In this case you have to use @code{ALTER
TABLE} to increase the @code{MAX_ROWS} and @code{AVG_ROW_LENGTH} table option
values:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
@end example

If you don't know the current table option values, use @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE
tbl_name}.

You can also use this technique for error 136 (no more room in index file).

For the other errors, you must repair your tables. @code{myisamchk} can
usually detect and fix most problems that occur.

The repair process involves up to four stages, described here. Before you
begin, you should @code{cd} to the database directory and check the
permissions of the table files. Make sure that they are readable by the Unix user
that @code{mysqld} runs as (and to you, because you need to access the files
you are checking).  If it turns out you need to modify files, they must also
be writable by you.

If you are using MySQL Version 3.23.16 and above, you can (and
should) use the @code{CHECK} and @code{REPAIR} commands to check and repair
@code{MyISAM} tables.
See @ref{CHECK TABLE,  , @code{CHECK TABLE}}
and @ref{REPAIR TABLE,  , @code{REPAIR TABLE}}.

The options that you can use for table maintenance with @code{myisamchk}
and @code{isamchk} are described in several of the earlier subsections of
@ref{Table maintenance}.

The following section is for the cases where the above command fails or
if you want to use the extended features that @code{myisamchk} and
@code{isamchk} provide.

If you are going to repair a table from the command line, you must first
stop the @code{mysqld} server. Note that when you do
@code{mysqladmin shutdown} on a remote server, the @code{mysqld} server
will still be alive for a while after @code{mysqladmin} returns, until
all queries are stopped and all keys have been flushed to disk.

@noindent
@strong{Stage 1: Checking your tables}

Run @code{myisamchk *.MYI} or @code{myisamchk -e *.MYI} if you have
more time.  Use the @code{-s} (silent) option to suppress unnecessary
information.

If the @code{mysqld} server is down, you should use the @code{--update-state}
option to tell @code{myisamchk} to mark the table as 'checked'.

You have to repair only those tables for which @code{myisamchk} announces an
error.  For such tables, proceed to Stage 2.

If you get weird errors when checking (such as @code{out of
memory} errors), or if @code{myisamchk} crashes, go to Stage 3.

@noindent
@strong{Stage 2: Easy safe repair}

Note: If you want a repair operation to go much faster, you should set the
values of the @code{sort_buffer_size} and @code{key_buffer_size} variables
each to about 25% of your available memory when running @code{myisamchk}
or @code{isamchk}.

First, try @code{myisamchk -r -q tbl_name} (@code{-r -q} means ``quick
recovery mode''). This will attempt to repair the index file without
touching the data file.  If the data file contains everything that it
should and the delete links point at the correct locations within the
data file, this should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing the
next table.  Otherwise, use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item
Make a backup of the data file before continuing.

@item
Use @code{myisamchk -r tbl_name} (@code{-r} means ``recovery mode''). This will
remove incorrect records and deleted records from the data file and
reconstruct the index file.

@item
If the preceding step fails, use @code{myisamchk --safe-recover tbl_name}.
Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases that
regular recovery mode doesn't (but is slower).
@end enumerate

If you get weird errors when repairing (such as @code{out of
memory} errors), or if @code{myisamchk} crashes, go to Stage 3.

@noindent
@strong{Stage 3: Difficult repair}

You should only reach this stage if the first 16KB block in the index file is
destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if the index file is
missing.  In this case, it's necessary to create a new index file. Do so as
follows:

@enumerate
@item
Move the data file to some safe place.

@item
Use the table description file to create new (empty) data and index files:

@example
shell> mysql db_name
mysql> SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;
mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name;
mysql> quit
@end example

If your SQL version doesn't have @code{TRUNCATE TABLE}, use @code{DELETE FROM
tbl_name} instead.

@item
Copy the old data file back onto the newly created data file.
(Don't just move the old file back onto the new file; you want to retain
a copy in case something goes wrong.)
@end enumerate

Go back to Stage 2.  @code{myisamchk -r -q} should work now.  (This shouldn't
be an endless loop.)

As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can also use @code{REPAIR TABLE ... USE_FRM}
which performs the whole procedure automatically.

@noindent
@strong{Stage 4: Very difficult repair}

You should reach this stage only if the @file{.frm} description file has also
crashed. That should never happen, because the description file isn't changed
after the table is created:

@enumerate
@item
Restore the description file from a backup and go back to Stage 3.  You can
also restore the index file and go back to Stage 2.  In the latter case, you
should start with @code{myisamchk -r}.

@item
If you don't have a backup but know exactly how the table was created,
create a copy of the table in another database.  Remove the new data file,
then move the @file{.frm} description and @file{.MYI} index files from the
other database to your crashed database.  This gives you new description
and index files, but leaves the @file{.MYD} data file alone.  Go back to
Stage 2 and attempt to reconstruct the index file.

@end enumerate


@node Optimisation,  , Repair, Table maintenance
@subsubsection Table Optimization

@cindex tables, optimizing
@cindex optimizing, tables

To coalesce fragmented records and eliminate wasted space resulting from
deleting or updating records, run @code{myisamchk} in recovery mode:

@example
shell> myisamchk -r tbl_name
@end example

You can optimize a table in the same way by using the SQL @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}
statement.  @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} does a repair of the table and a key
analysis, and also sorts the index tree to give faster key lookups.
There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility
and the server, because the server does all the work when you use
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}. @xref{OPTIMIZE TABLE,  , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}}.

@code{myisamchk} also has a number of other options you can use to improve
the performance of a table:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{-S}, @code{--sort-index}
@item @code{-R index_num}, @code{--sort-records=index_num}
@item @code{-a}, @code{--analyze}
@end itemize

For a full description of the options, see @ref{myisamchk syntax}.

@subsection Setting Up a Table Maintenance Regimen

@cindex maintaining, tables
@cindex tables, maintenance regimen

It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than
waiting for problems to occur.
One way to check and repair @code{MyISAM} tables is
with the @code{CHECK TABLE} and @code{REPAIR TABLE} statements.
These are available starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13.
See @ref{CHECK TABLE,  , @code{CHECK TABLE}} and
@ref{REPAIR TABLE,  , @code{REPAIR TABLE}}.

Another way to check tables is to use @code{myisamchk}.  For maintenance
purposes, you can use @code{myisamchk -s}.  The @code{-s} option (short for
@code{--silent}) causes @code{myisamchk} to run in silent mode, printing
messages only when errors occur.

@tindex .pid (process ID) file
It's also a good idea to check tables when the server starts.
For example, whenever the machine has done a restart in the middle of an
update, you usually need to check all the tables that could have been
affected. (This is an ``expected crashed table.'') You could add a test to
@code{mysqld_safe} that runs @code{myisamchk} to check all tables that have
been modified during the last 24 hours if there is an old @file{.pid}
(process ID) file left after a restart.  (The @file{.pid} file is created by
@code{mysqld} when it starts and removed when it terminates normally.  The
presence of a @file{.pid} file at system startup time indicates that
@code{mysqld} terminated abnormally.)

An even better test would be to check any table whose last-modified time
is more recent than that of the @file{.pid} file.

You should also check your tables regularly during normal system
operation.  At MySQL AB, we run a @code{cron} job to check all
our important tables once a week, using a line like this in a @file{crontab}
file:

@example
35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
@end example

This prints out information about crashed tables so we can examine and repair
them when needed.

As we haven't had any unexpectedly crashed tables (tables that become
corrupted for reasons other than hardware trouble)
for a couple of years now (this is really true), once a week is
more than enough for us.

We recommend that to start with, you execute @code{myisamchk -s} each
night on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours,
until you come to trust MySQL as much as we do.

@cindex tables, defragment
Normally you don't need to maintain MySQL tables that much.  If
you are changing tables with dynamic-sized rows (tables with @code{VARCHAR},
@code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} columns) or have tables with many deleted rows
you may want to from time to time (once a month?) defragment/reclaim space
from the tables.

You can do this by using @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} on the tables in question.
If you can stop the @code{mysqld} server for a while, change location into the
data directory and use this command while the server is stopped:

@example
shell> myisamchk -r -s --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI
@end example

For @code{ISAM} tables, the command is similar:

@example
shell> myisamchk -r -s --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI
@end example


@node Table-info,  , Maintenance regimen, Disaster Prevention
@subsection Getting Information About a Table

@cindex tables, information

To obtain a description of a table or statistics about it, use the commands shown
here. We explain some of the information in more detail later:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{myisamchk -d tbl_name}

Runs @code{myisamchk} in ``describe mode'' to produce a description of
your table. If you start the MySQL server using the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option, @code{myisamchk} may report an error
for a table that is updated while it runs.  However, because @code{myisamchk}
doesn't change the table in describe mode, there is no risk of
destroying data.

@item @code{myisamchk -d -v tbl_name}

Adding @code{-v} runs @code{myisamchk} in verbose mode so that it produces
more information about what it is doing.

@item @code{myisamchk -eis tbl_name}

Shows only the most important information from a table. This operation is slow
because it must read the entire table.

@item @code{myisamchk -eiv tbl_name}

This is like @code{-eis}, but tells you what is being done.

@end itemize

@cindex examples, @code{myisamchk} output
@cindex @code{myisamchk}, example output

Example output for some of these commands follows. They are based on a table
with these data and index file sizes:

Explanations for the types of information @code{myisamchk} produces are
given here.  ``Keyfile'' refers to the index file.  ``Record'' and ``row''
are synonymous:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{MyISAM file}

Name of the @code{MyISAM} (index) file.

@item @code{File-version}

Version of @code{MyISAM} format. Currently always 2.

@item @code{Creation time}

When the data file was created.

@item @code{Recover time}

When the index/data file was last reconstructed.

@item @code{Data records}

How many records are in the table.

@item @code{Deleted blocks}

How many deleted blocks still have reserved space.
You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
@xref{Optimisation}.

@item @code{Data file parts}

For dynamic record format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For
an optimized table without fragmented records, this is the same as @code{Data
records}.

@item @code{Deleted data}

How many bytes of unreclaimed deleted data there are.
You can optimize your table to minimize this space.
@xref{Optimisation}.

@item @code{Data file pointer}

The size of the data file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3, 4, or 5
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this cannot be controlled
from MySQL yet. For fixed tables, this is a record address. For
dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

@item @code{Keyfile pointer}

The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2, or 3
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this is calculated
automatically by MySQL. It is always a block address.

@item @code{Max datafile length}

How long the table's data file can become, in bytes.

@item @code{Max keyfile length}

How long the table's index file can become, in bytes.

@item @code{Recordlength}

How much space each record takes, in bytes.

@item @code{Record format}

The format used to store table rows.
The preceding examples use @code{Fixed length}.
Other possible values are @code{Compressed} and @code{Packed}.

@item @code{table description}

A list of all keys in the table. For each key, @code{myisamchk} displays
some low-level information:

@itemize @minus
@item @code{Key}

This key's number.

@item @code{Start}

Where in the record this index part starts.

@item @code{Len}

How long this index part is. For packed numbers, this should always be
the full length of the column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full
length of the indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a string
column.

@item @code{Index}

Whether a key value can exist multiple times in the index. Values are
@code{unique} or @code{multip.} (multiple).

@item @code{Type}

What data type this index part has. This is a @code{MyISAM} data type
with the options @code{packed}, @code{stripped}, or @code{empty}.

@item @code{Root}

Address of the root index block.

@item @code{Blocksize}

The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but the value may be
changed at compile time when MySQL is built from source.

@item @code{Rec/key}

This is a statistical value used by the optimizer. It tells how many
records there are per value for this key. A unique key always has a
value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or greatly
changed) with @code{myisamchk -a}. If this is not updated at all, a default
value of 30 is given.
@end itemize

For the table shown in the examples, there are two @code{table description}
lines for the ninth index. This indicates that it is a multiple-part index
with two parts.

@item @code{Keyblocks used}

What percentage of the keyblocks are used. When a table has just been
reorganized with @code{myisamchk}, as for the table in the examples, the
values are very high (very near the theoretical maximum).

@item @code{Packed}

MySQL tries to pack keys with a common suffix. This can only be used
for indexes on @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, or @code{DECIMAL} columns. For
long indexed strings that have similar leftmost parts,
this can significantly reduce the space used. In the third example
above, the fourth key is 10 characters long and a 60% reduction in space is
achieved.

@item @code{Max levels}

How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long key values get high
values.

@item @code{Records}

How many rows are in the table.

@item @code{M.recordlength}

The average record length.  This is the exact record length for tables
with fixed-length records, because all records have the same length.

@item @code{Packed}

MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The @code{Packed}
value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.

@item @code{Recordspace used}

What percentage of the data file is used.

@item @code{Empty space}

What percentage of the data file is unused.

@item @code{Blocks/Record}

Average number of blocks per record (that is, how many links a fragmented
record is composed of). This is always 1.0 for fixed-format tables. This
value should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets too big, you can
reorganize the table with @code{myisamchk}.
@xref{Optimisation}.

@item @code{Recordblocks}

How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed format, this is the same as the number
of records.

@item @code{Deleteblocks}

How many blocks (links) are deleted.

@item @code{Recorddata}

How many bytes in the data file are used.

@item @code{Deleted data}

How many bytes in the data file are deleted (unused).

@item @code{Lost space}

If a record is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost. This is
the sum of all such losses, in bytes.

@item @code{Linkdata}

When the dynamic table format is used, record fragments are linked with
pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). @code{Linkdata} is the sum of the amount of
storage used by all such pointers.

@end itemize

If a table has been compressed with @code{myisampack}, @code{myisamchk
-d} prints additional information about each table column.  See
@ref{myisampack, , @code{myisampack}}, for an example of this
information and a description of what it means.

@subsection The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting

@cindex character sets
@cindex data, character sets
@cindex sorting, character sets

By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set
with sorting according to Swedish/Finnish rules. These defaults are suitable
for the USA and most of western Europe.

All MySQL binary distributions are compiled with
@code{--with-extra-charsets=complex}.  This adds code to all
standard programs that enables them to handle @code{latin1} and all multi-byte
character sets within the binary. Other character sets will be
loaded from a character-set definition file when needed.

The character set determines what characters are allowed in names. It also
determines how strings are sorted by the @code{ORDER BY} and @code{GROUP
BY} clauses of the @code{SELECT} statement.

You can change the character set with the @code{--default-character-set}
option when you start the server.  The character sets available depend
on the @code{--with-charset=charset} and @code{--with-extra-charsets=
list-of-charset | complex | all | none} options to @code{configure}, and the
character set configuration files listed in
@file{SHAREDIR/charsets/Index}.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, you can also change the character set collation with the
@code{--default-collation} option when you start the server.  The collation
must be a legal collation for the default character set.  (Use the
@code{SHOW COLLATION} statement to determine which collations are available
for each character set.)
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

If you change the character set when running MySQL, that may also
change the sort order.  Consequently, you must run @code{myisamchk -r -q
--set-character-set=charset} on all tables, or your indexes may not be
ordered correctly.

When a client connects to a MySQL server, the server indicates to the
client what the server's default character set is.  The client will switch
to use this character set for this connection.

You should use @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} when escaping strings
for an SQL query.  @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} is identical to the
old @code{mysql_escape_string()} function, except that it takes the @code{MYSQL}
connection handle as the first parameter so that the appropriate character set
can be taken into account when escaping characters.

If the client is compiled with different paths than where the server is
installed and the user who configured MySQL didn't include all character
sets in the MySQL binary, you must tell the client where it can find the
additional character sets it will need if the server runs with a different
character set than the client.

You can do this by specifying a @code{--character-sets-dir} option to
indicate the path to the directory in which the dynamic MySQL character
sets are stored. For example, you can put the following in an option file:

@example
[client]
character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets
@end example

You can force the client to use specific character set as follows:

@example
[client]
default-character-set=character-set-name
@end example

This is normally unnecessary, however.

@subsubsection Using the German Character Set

@c TODO: is this as of 4.1 only?

To get German sorting order, you should start @code{mysqld} with a
@code{--default-character-set=latin1_de} option.  This will give you the
following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When sorting and comparing strings, the following mapping is performed on the
strings before doing the comparison:

@example
@"a  ->  ae
@"o  ->  oe
@"u  ->  ue
@ss{}  ->  ss
@end example

@item
All accented characters are converted to their unaccented uppercase
counterpart.  All letters are converted to uppercase.

@item
When comparing strings with @code{LIKE}, the one-character to two-character mapping
is not done. All letters are converted to uppercase. Accents are removed
from all letters except @code{@"U}, @code{@"u}, @code{@"O}, @code{@"o},
@code{@"A}, and @code{@"a}.

@end itemize


@node Languages, Adding character set, Character sets, Localisation
@subsection Setting the Error Message Language

@cindex error messages, languages
@cindex messages, languages
@cindex files, error messages
@cindex language support

By default, @code{mysqld} produces error messages in English, but they can
also be displayed in any of these other languages:
Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Norwegian-ny, Polish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, or Swedish.

To start @code{mysqld} with a particular language for error messages, use a the
@code{--languag} or @code{-L} option. The option value can be a language name
or the full path to the error message file.
For example:

@example
shell> mysqld --language=swedish
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysqld --language=/usr/local/share/swedish
@end example

Note that the language name should be specified in lowercase.

The language files are located (by default) in the
@file{share/@var{LANGUAGE}} directory under the MySQL base
directory.

To change the error message file, you should edit the @file{errmsg.txt} file,
and then execute the following command to generate the @file{errmsg.sys} file:

@example
shell> comp_err errmsg.txt errmsg.sys
@end example

If you upgrade to a newer version of MySQL, remember to repeat
your changes with the new @file{errmsg.txt} file.


@node Adding character set, Character arrays, Languages, Localisation
@subsection Adding a New Character Set

@cindex character sets, adding
@cindex adding, character sets

This section discusses the procedure for adding add another character set to
MySQL.  You must have a MySQL source distribution to use these instructions.

To choose the proper procedure, decide whether the character
set is simple or complex:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If the character set does not need to use special string collating routines
for sorting and does not need multi-byte character support, it is simple.

@item
If it needs either of those features, it is complex.

@end itemize

For example, @code{latin1} and @code{danish} are simple character sets,
whereas @code{big5} and @code{czech} are complex character sets.

In the following procedures, the name of your character
set is represented by @code{MYSET}.

For a simple character set, do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Add @code{MYSET} to the end of the @file{sql/share/charsets/Index} file.
Assign a unique number to it.

@item
Create the file @file{sql/share/charsets/MYSET.conf}.
(You can use a copy of @file{sql/share/charsets/latin1.conf} as the basis for
this file.)

The syntax for the file is very simple:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Comments start with a @samp{#} character and proceed to the end of the line.
@item
Words are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
@item
When defining the character set, every word must be a number in hexadecimal
format.
@item
The @code{ctype} array takes up the first 257 words. The
@code{to_lower[]}, @code{to_upper[]} and @code{sort_order[]} arrays take up
256 words each after that.
@end itemize

@xref{Character arrays}.

@item
Add the character set name to the @code{CHARSETS_AVAILABLE} and
@code{COMPILED_CHARSETS} lists in @code{configure.in}.

@item
Reconfigure, recompile, and test.

@end enumerate

For a complex character set, do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Create the file @file{strings/ctype-MYSET.c} in the MySQL source
distribution.

@item
Add @code{MYSET} to the end of the @file{sql/share/charsets/Index} file.
Assign a unique number to it.

@item
Look at one of the existing @file{ctype-*.c} files (such as
@file{strings/ctype-big5.c}) to see what needs to be defined.
Note that the
arrays in your file must have names like @code{ctype_MYSET},
@code{to_lower_MYSET}, and so on.  These correspond to the arrays
for a simple character set. @xref{Character arrays}.

@item
Near the top of the file, place a special comment like this:

@example
/*
 * This comment is parsed by configure to create ctype.c,
 * so don't change it unless you know what you are doing.
 *
 * .configure. number_MYSET=MYNUMBER
 * .configure. strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N
 * .configure. mbmaxlen_MYSET=N
 */
@end example

The @code{configure} program uses this comment to include
the character set into the MySQL library automatically.

The @code{strxfrm_multiply} and @code{mbmaxlen} lines are explained in
the following sections.  You need include them only if you need the string
collating functions or the multi-byte character set functions,
respectively.

@item
You should then create some of the following functions:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{my_strncoll_MYSET()}
@item @code{my_strcoll_MYSET()}
@item @code{my_strxfrm_MYSET()}
@item @code{my_like_range_MYSET()}
@end itemize

@xref{String collating}.

@item
Add the character set name to the @code{CHARSETS_AVAILABLE} and
@code{COMPILED_CHARSETS} lists in @code{configure.in}.

@item
Reconfigure, recompile, and test.
@end enumerate

The @file{sql/share/charsets/README} file includes additional instructions.

If you want to have the character set included in the MySQL
distribution, mail a patch to the MySQL internals mailing list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.


@node Character arrays, String collating, Adding character set, Localisation
@subsection The Character Definition Arrays

@code{to_lower[]} and @code{to_upper[]} are simple arrays that hold the
lowercase and uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the
character set.  For example:

@example
to_lower['A'] should contain 'a'
to_upper['a'] should contain 'A'
@end example

@code{sort_order[]} is a map indicating how characters should be ordered for
comparison and sorting purposes. Quite often (but not for all character sets)
this is the same as @code{to_upper[]}, which means that sorting will be
case-insensitive. MySQL will sort characters based on the value of
@code{sort_order[character]}.  For more complicated sorting rules, see
the discussion of string collating in @ref{String collating}.

@code{ctype[]} is an array of bit values, with one element for one character.
(Note that @code{to_lower[]}, @code{to_upper[]}, and @code{sort_order[]}
are indexed by character value, but @code{ctype[]} is indexed by character
value + 1.  This is an old legacy convention to be able to handle @code{EOF}.)

You can find the following bitmask definitions in @file{m_ctype.h}:

@example
#define _U      01      /* Uppercase */
#define _L      02      /* Lowercase */
#define _N      04      /* Numeral (digit) */
#define _S      010     /* Spacing character */
#define _P      020     /* Punctuation */
#define _C      040     /* Control character */
#define _B      0100    /* Blank */
#define _X      0200    /* heXadecimal digit */
@end example

The @code{ctype[]} entry for each character should be the union of the
applicable bitmask values that describe the character.  For example,
@code{'A'} is an uppercase character (@code{_U}) as well as a
hexadecimal digit (@code{_X}), so @code{ctype['A'+1]} should contain the
value:

@example
_U + _X = 01 + 0200 = 0201
@end example


@node String collating, Multi-byte characters, Character arrays, Localisation
@subsection String Collating Support

@cindex collating, strings
@cindex string collating

If the sorting rules for your language are too complex to be handled
with the simple @code{sort_order[]} table, you need to use the string
collating functions.

Right now the best documentation for this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the @code{big5}, @code{czech}, @code{gbk},
@code{sjis}, and @code{tis160} character sets for examples.

You must specify the @code{strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N} value in the
special comment at the top of the file.  @code{N} should be set to
the maximum ratio the strings may grow during @code{my_strxfrm_MYSET} (it
must be a positive integer).


@node Multi-byte characters, Problems with character sets, String collating, Localisation
@subsection Multi-byte Character Support

@cindex characters, multi-byte
@cindex multi-byte characters

If your want to add support for a new character set that includes
multi-byte characters, you need to use the multi-byte character
functions.

Right now the best documentation on this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the @code{euc_kr}, @code{gb2312},
@code{gbk}, @code{sjis}, and @code{ujis} character sets for
examples. These are implemented in the @file{ctype-'charset'.c} files
in the @file{strings} directory.

You must specify the @code{mbmaxlen_MYSET=N} value in the special
comment at the top of the source file.  @code{N} should be set to the
size in bytes of the largest character in the set.

@node Problems with character sets,  , Multi-byte characters, Localisation
@subsection Problems With Character Sets

If you try to use a character set that is not compiled into your binary,
you might run into the following problems:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Your program has an incorrect path to where the character sets are stored.
(Default @file{/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets}).
This can be fixed by using the @code{--character-sets-dir}
option when you run the program in question.
@item
The character set is a multi-byte character set that can't be loaded
dynamically.  In this case, you must recompile the program with
support for the character set.
@item
@c TODO: dynamic = not compiled in?
The character set is a dynamic character set, but you don't have a
configure file for it.  In this case, you should install the configure
file for the character set from a new MySQL distribution.
@item
If your @file{Index} file doesn't contain the name for the character set, your
program will display the following error message:

@example
ERROR 1105: File '/usr/local/share/mysql/charsets/?.conf'
not found (Errcode: 2)
@end example

In this case, you should either get a new @code{Index} file or manually add
the name of any missing character sets to the current file.
@end itemize

For @code{MyISAM} tables, you can check the character set name and number for a
table with @code{myisamchk -dvv tbl_name}.


@node Log Files, Multiple servers, Localisation, MySQL Database Administration
@section The MySQL Log Files

@cindex Log files

MySQL has several different log files that can help you find
out what's going on inside @code{mysqld}:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{Log File} @tab @strong{Types of Information Logged to File}
@item The error log @tab Problems encountering starting, running, or stopping @code{mysqld}.
@item The isam log @tab Logs all changes to the @code{ISAM} tables. Used only for debugging the isam code.
@item The query log @tab Established client connections and executed statements.
@item The update log @tab Statements that change data. This log is deprecated.
@item The binary log @tab Stores all statements that change data. Also used for replication.
@item The slow log @tab Stores all queries that took more than @code{long_query_time} seconds to execute or didn't use indexes.
@end multitable

By default, all logs are created in the @code{mysqld} data directory.  You can
force @code{mysqld} to close and reopen the log files (or in some cases
switch to a new log) by flushing the logs. Log flushing occurs when you
issue a @code{FLUSH LOGS} statement or execute @code{mysqladmin flush-logs} or
@code{mysqladmin refresh}.
@xref{FLUSH}.

If you are using MySQL replication capabilities, slave replication servers
maintain additional log files called relay logs. These are discussed in
@ref{Replication}.

@node Error log, Query log, Log Files, Log Files
@subsection The Error Log

The error log file contains information indicating when @code{mysqld}
was started and stopped and also any critical errors that occur while the
server is running.

If @code{mysqld} dies unexpectedly and @code{mysqld_safe} needs to
restart it, @code{mysqld_safe} will write a @code{restarted
mysqld} message to the error log.  If
@code{mysqld} notices a table that needs to be automatically checked or
repaired, it writes a message to the error log.

On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace if
@code{mysqld} dies. The trace can be used to determine where
@code{mysqld} died.  @xref{Using stack trace}.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10, you can specify where @code{mysqld} stores the
error log file with the option @code{--log-error[=file_name]}. If no
@code{file_name} value is given, @code{mysqld} uses the name
@file{'hostname'.err} and writes the file in the data directory.
(Prior to MySQL 4.0.10, the Windows error log name is @file{mysql.err}.)
If you execute @code{FLUSH LOGS} the error log will be renamed with a suffix
of @code{-old} and @code{mysqld} creates a new empty log file.

In older MySQL versions on Unix, error log handling was done by
@code{mysqld_safe} which redirected the error file to
@code{'hostname'.err}.  You could change this filename by specifying a
@code{--err-log=filename} option to @code{mysqld_safe}.

If you don't specify @code{--log-error}, or (on Windows) if you use the
@code{--console} option, errors are written to stderr, the standard error
output. Usually this is your terminal.

On Windows, error output is always written to the @code{.err} file if
@code{--console} is not given.

@node Query log, Update log, Error log, Log Files
@subsection The General Query Log

@cindex query log
@cindex files, query log

If you want to know what happens within @code{mysqld}, you should start
it with the @code{--log[=file_name]} or @code{-l [file_name]} option.
If no @code{file_name} value is given, the default name is
@file{hostname.log}
This will log all connections and statements to the log file.
This log can be very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want
to know exactly what the client sent to @code{mysqld}.

@c Note: This instance of "safe_mysql" should not be changed to "mysqld_safe"
@c because it's a 3.23.x-specific command
Older versions of the @code{mysql.server} script (from MySQL 3.23.4 to 3.23.8)
pass @code{safe_mysqld} a @code{--log} option to enable the general query log.
If you need better performance when you start using MySQL in a production
environment, you can remove the @code{--log} option from @code{mysql.server}
or change it to @code{--log-bin}. @xref{Binary log}.

@code{mysqld} writes statements to the query log in the order that it
receives them.  This may be different from the order in which they are
executed.  This is in contrast to the update log and the binary log, which
are written after the query is executed, but before any locks are released.

Server restarts and log flushing do not cause a new general query log file
to be generated (although flushing closes and reopens it). On Unix, you can
rename the file and create a new one by using the following commands:

@example
shell> mv hostname.log hostname-old.log
shell> mysqladmin flush-logs
shell> cp hostname-old.log to-backup-directory
shell> rm hostname-old.log
@end example

On Windows, you cannot rename the log file while the server has it open.
You must stop the server and rename the log. Then restart the server to create
a new log.


@node Update log, Binary log, Query log, Log Files
@subsection The Update Log

@cindex update log
@cindex files, update log

@strong{Note:} The update log has been deprecated and replaced by the binary
log. @xref{Binary log}.  The binary log can do anything the old update log
could do, and more. @strong{The update log is unavailable as of MySQL
5.0.0}.

When started with the @code{--log-update[=file_name]} option,
@code{mysqld} writes a log file containing all SQL statements that update
data. If no @code{file_name} value is given, the default name is name of the host
machine. If a filename is given, but it doesn't contain a leading path, the file
is written in the data directory. If @file{file_name} doesn't have an
extension, @code{mysqld} creates log files with names of the form
@file{file_name.###}, where @code{###} is a number that is incremented each
time you start the server or flush the logs.

@strong{Note:} For this naming scheme to work, you must not create
your own files with the same names as those that might be used for the log
file sequence.

Update logging is smart because it logs only statements that really update
data. So an @code{UPDATE} or a @code{DELETE} with a @code{WHERE} that finds no
rows is not written to the log. It even skips @code{UPDATE} statements that
set a column to the value it already has.

The update logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that statements
are logged in execution order.

If you want to update a database from update log files, you could do the
following (assuming that your update logs have names of the form
@file{file_name.###}):

@example
shell> ls -1 -t -r file_name.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
@end example

@code{ls} is used to sort the update log filenames into the right order.

This can be useful if you have to revert to backup files after a crash
and you want to redo the updates that occurred between the time of the backup
and the crash.


@node Binary log, Slow query log, Update log, Log Files
@subsection The Binary Log

@cindex binary log
@cindex files, binary log

The binary log has replaced the old update log, which is is unavailable
starting from MySQL 5.0. The binary log contains all information that is
available in the update log in a more efficient format and in a manner
that is transactionally safe.

The binary log, like the old update log, only logs statements that really
update data. So an @code{UPDATE} or a @code{DELETE} with a @code{WHERE}
that finds no rows is not written to the log. It even skips @code{UPDATE}
statements that set a column to the value it already has.

The binary log also contains information about how long each statement took
that updated the database.  It doesn't contain statements that don't modify
any data.  If you want to log all statements (for example to identify a problem
query) you should use the general query log. @xref{Query log}.

The primary purpose of the binary log is to be able to update the database
during a restore operation as fully as possible, as the binary log will
contain all updates done after a backup was made.

The binary log is also used on master replication servers as a record of the
statements to be sent to slave servers.
@xref{Replication}.

Running the server with the binary log enabled makes performance about 1%
slower. However, the benefits of the binary log for restore operations and
in allowing you to set up replication generally outweigh this minor
performance decrement.

When started with the @code{--log-bin[=file_name]} option, @code{mysqld}
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no
@code{file_name} value is given, the default name is the name of the host machine followed
by @code{-bin}. If file name is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the
file is written in the data directory.

If you supply an extension in the log name (for example,
@code{--log-bin=filename.extension}), the
extension is silently removed and ignored.

@code{mysqld} appends a numeric extension to the binary log name. The number
is incremented each time you start the server or flush the logs.
A new binary log also is created
automatically when the current log's size reaches 
@code{max_binlog_size}. A binary log may become larger than
@code{max_binlog_size} if you are using large transactions: A transaction is
written to the binary log in one piece, never split between binary logs.

To be able to know which different binary log files have been used,
@code{mysqld} also creates a binary log index file that
contains the name of all used binary log files. By default this has the
same name as the binary log file, with the extension @code{'.index'}.
You can change the name of the binary log index file with the
@code{--log-bin-index=[file_name]} option.
You should not manually edit this file while @code{mysqld} is running;
doing this would confuse @code{mysqld}.

You can delete all binary log files with the @code{RESET MASTER} statement,
or only some of them with @code{PURGE MASTER LOGS}.
See @ref{RESET, , @code{RESET}} and @ref{Replication Master SQL}.

You can use the following options to @code{mysqld} to affect what is logged
to the binary log. Note also the discussion that follows this option list.

@table @code

@item --binlog-do-db=db_name
Tells the master that it should log updates to the binary log if the
current database
(that is, the one selected by @code{USE})
is @code{db_name}. All others
databases that are not explicitly mentioned are ignored.
Note that if you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in
the current database.

An example of what does not work as you might expect: If the server is
started with @code{binlog-do-db=sales}, and you do
@code{USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;},
this statement will not be written into the binary log.

@item --binlog-ignore-db=db_name
Tells the master that updates where the current database
(that is, the one selected by @code{USE}) is
@code{db_name} should not be stored in the binary log.  Note that if
you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in the current
database.

An example of what does not work as you might expect: If the server is
started with @code{binlog-ignore-db=sales}, and you do
@code{USE prices; UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;},
this statement will be written into the binary log.

@end table

To log or ignore multiple databases, specify the appropriate option multiple
times, once for each database.

The rules for logging or ignoring updates to the binary log are evaluated in
the following order:

@enumerate
@item
Are there @code{binlog-do-db} or @code{binlog-ignore-db} rules?
@itemize @bullet
@item No:
Write the statement to the binary log and exit.
@item Yes:
Go to the next step.
@end itemize
@item
So there are some rules (@code{binlog-do-db} or
@code{binlog-ignore-db} or both). Is there a current database (has any
database been selected by @code{USE}?)?
@itemize @bullet
@item No:
Do @strong{NOT} write the statement, and exit.
@item Yes:
Go to the next step.
@end itemize
@item
There is a current database. Are there some @code{binlog-do-db} rules?
@itemize @bullet
@item Yes:
Does the current database match any of the @code{binlog-do-db}
rules?
@itemize @bullet
@item Yes:
Write the statement and exit.
@item No:
Do @strong{NOT} write the statement, and exit.
@end itemize 
@item No:
Go to the next step.
@end itemize
@item
There are some @code{binlog-ignore-db} rules.
Does the current database match any of the @code{binlog-ignore-db}
rules?
@itemize @bullet
@item Yes:
Do not write the statement, and exit.
@item No:
Write the query and exit.
@end itemize 
@end enumerate

So for example, a slave running with only @code{binlog-do-db=sales}
will not write to the binary log any statement whose current database is
different from @code{sales} (in other words, @code{binlog-do-db} can
sometimes mean ``ignore other databases'').

If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files until you are sure that no slave will ever need to use them.
One way to do this is to do @code{mysqladmin flush-logs} once a day and then
remove any logs that are more than 3 days old. You can remove them
manually, or preferably using @code{PURGE MASTER LOGS}
(@pxref{Replication Master SQL}) which will also safely update the binary 
log index file for you  (and which can take a date argument since
MySQL 4.1)

A client with the @code{SUPER} privilege can disable binary
logging of its own statements by using a @code{SET
SQL_LOG_BIN=0} statement. @xref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET}}.

You can examine the binary log file with the @code{mysqlbinlog} utility.
This can be useful when you want to reprocess statements in the log.
For example, you can update a MySQL server from the binary log
as follows:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog log-file | mysql -h server_name
@end example

See @ref{mysqlbinlog,  , @code{mysqlbinlog}} for more information on the
@code{mysqlbinlog} utility and how to use it.

If you are using transactions, you must
use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the old update log.

The binary logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

Updates to non-transactional tables are stored in the binary log
immediately after execution.  For transactional tables such as @code{BDB}
or @code{InnoDB} tables, all updates (@code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}
or @code{INSERT}) that change tables are cached until a @code{COMMIT}
statement is received by the server. At that point, @code{mysqld} writes the
whole transaction to the binary log before the @code{COMMIT} is executed.
When the thread that handles the transaction starts, it allocates a buffer
of @code{binlog_cache_size} to buffer queries.  If a statement is bigger
than this, the thread opens a temporary file to store the transaction.  The
temporary file is deleted when the thread ends.

The @code{max_binlog_cache_size} (default 4G) can be used to restrict the
total size used to cache a multiple-statement transaction.  If a transaction
is larger than this, it will fail and roll back.

If you are using the update log or binary log, concurrent inserts will
be converted to normal inserts when using @code{CREATE ... SELECT} or
@code{INSERT ... SELECT}.
This is to ensure that you can re-create an exact copy of your tables by
applying the log on a backup.

The binary log format is different in versions 3.23, 4.0, and 5.0.0.
Those format changes were required to implement enhancements to replication.
MySQL 4.1 has the same binary log format as 4.0.

@node Slow query log, Log file maintenance, Binary log, Log Files
@subsection The Slow Query Log

@cindex slow query log
@cindex files, slow query log

When started with the @code{--log-slow-queries[=file_name]} option,
@code{mysqld} writes a log file containing all SQL statements that took
more than @code{long_query_time} seconds to execute. The time to acquire
the initial table locks are not counted as execution time.

If no @code{file_name} value is given, the default is the name of the
host machine with a suffix of @code{-slow.log}. If a filename is given,
but doesn't contain a path, the file is written in the data directory.

A statement is logged to the slow query log after it has been executed
and after all locks have been released. Log order may be different from
execution order.

The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to
execute and are thus candidates for optimization. However, examining a long
slow query log can become a difficult task. To make this easier, you
can pipe the slow query log through the @code{mysqldumpslow} command to
get a summary of the queries that appear in the log.

@c TODO: this differs now in 4.1, I believe

If you also use the @code{--log-long-format} when logging slow queries,
then queries that are not using indexes are logged as well.  @xref{Server
options}.


@node Log file maintenance,  , Slow query log, Log Files
@subsection Log File Maintenance

@cindex files, log
@cindex maintaining, log files
@cindex log files, maintaining

The MySQL Server can create a number of different log files, which make
it easy to see what is going on. @xref{Log Files}. However, you must
clean up these files regularly, to ensure that the logs don't take up
too much disk space.

When using MySQL with logging enabled, you will want to backup and remove
old log files from time to time and tell MySQL to start logging to new files.
@xref{Backup}.

On a Linux (Red Hat) installation, you can use the
@code{mysql-log-rotate} script for this. If you installed MySQL
from an RPM distribution, the script should have been installed
automatically.  Note that you should be careful with this script if you are
using the binary log for replication! (You should not remove binary logs until
you are certain that their contents have been processed by all slaves.)

On other systems, you must install a short script yourself that you
start from @code{cron} to handle log files.

You can force MySQL to start using new log files by using
@code{mysqladmin flush-logs} or by using the SQL statement @code{FLUSH LOGS}.
If you are using MySQL Version 3.21, you must use @code{mysqladmin refresh}.

A log flushing operation does the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If standard logging (@code{--log}) or slow query logging
(@code{--log-slow-queries}) is used, closes and reopens the log file
(@file{mysql.log} and @file{`hostname`-slow.log} as default).
@item
If update logging (@code{--log-update}) or binary logging (@code{--log-bin})
is used, closes the log and opens a new log file with a higher sequence number.
@end itemize

If you are using only an update log, you only have to flush the logs and then
move away the old update log files to a backup.
If you are using the normal logging, you can do something like:

@example
shell> cd mysql-data-directory
shell> mv mysql.log mysql.old
shell> mysqladmin flush-logs
@end example

Then make a backup and remove @file{mysql.old}.

@end menu

In some cases, you might want to run multiple @code{mysqld} servers
on the same machine.  You might want to test a new
MySQL release while leaving your existing production setup undisturbed.
Or you may want to give different users access to different @code{mysqld}
servers that they manage themselves.  (For example, you might be an
Internet Service Provider that wants to provide independent MySQL
installations for different customers.)

To run multiple servers on a single machine, each server must have
unique values for several operating parameters. These can be set on the
command line or in option files.
@xref{Program Options}.

At least the following options must be different for each server:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{--port=port_num}
@code{--port} controls the port number for TCP/IP connections.

@item @code{--socket=path}
@code{--socket} controls the socket file path on Unix and the name of the
named pipe on Windows. On Windows, it's necessary to specify distinct pipe names
only for those servers that support named pipe connections.

@item @code{--shared-memory-base-name=name}
This option currently is used only on Windows.
It designates the shared memory name used by a
Windows server to allow clients to connect via shared memory.
This option is new in MySQL 4.1.

@item @code{--pid-file=path}
This option is used only on Unix.
It indicates the name of the file in which the server writes its process ID.

@end itemize


If you use the following log file options, they must be different for
each server:

@c TODO: InnoDB options needed here?

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{--log=path}
@item @code{--log-bin=path}
@item @code{--log-update=path}
@item @code{--log-error=path}
@item @code{--log-isam=path}
@item @code{--bdb-logdir=path}
@end itemize

Log file options are described in @ref{Log file maintenance}.

If you want more performance, you can also specify the following options
differently for each server, to spread load between several physical disks:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{--tmpdir=path}
@item @code{--bdb-tmpdir=path}
@end itemize

Having different temporary directories is also recommended for the reason
that it is easier to determine which MySQL server created any given
temporary file.

Generally, each server should also use a different data directory, which is
specified using the @code{--datadir=path} option.

@strong{Warning:} Normally you should never have two servers that
update data in the same databases!  This may lead to unpleasant
surprises if your operating system doesn't support fault-free system
locking!  If (despite this warning) you run multiple servers using
the same data directory and they have logging enabled, you must
use the appropriate options to specify log file names that are
unique to each server.  Otherwise, the servers will try to log to
the same files.

This warning against sharing a data directory among servers also applies
in an NFS environment.  Allowing multiple MySQL servers to access a common
data directory over NFS is a @strong{bad idea}!

@itemize @bullet

@item
The primary problem is that NFS will become the speed bottleneck.
It is not meant for such use.

@item
Another risk with NFS is that you will have to come up with a way
to make sure that two or more servers do not interfere with each
other.  Usually NFS file locking is handled by the @code{lockd}
daemon, but at the moment there is no platform that will perform
locking 100% reliably in every situation.

@end itemize

Make it easy for yourself: Forget about sharing a data directory
among servers over NFS. A better solution is to have one computer
that contains several CPUs and use an operating system that
handles threads efficiently.

If you have multiple MySQL installations in different locations, normally
you can specify the base installation directory for each server with the
@code{--basedir=path} option to cause each server to use a different data
directory, log files, and PID file. (The defaults for all these values are
determined relative to the base directory). In that case, the only other
options you need to specify are the @code{--socket} and @code{--port}
options.  For example, suppose that you install different versions of MySQL using
@file{.tar} file binary distributions. These will install in different
locations, so you can start the server for each installation using the
command @code{./bin/mysqld_safe} under its corresponding base directory.
@code{mysqld_safe} will determine the proper
@code{--basedir} option to pass to @code{mysqld}, and you need specify
only the @code{--socket} and @code{--port} options to @code{mysqld_safe}.
(For versions of MySQL older than 4.0, use @code{safe_mysqld}
rather than @code{mysqld_safe}.)

As discussed in the following sections, it is possible to start additional
servers by setting environment variables or by specifying appropriate
command-line options.  However, if you need to run multiple servers on
a more permanent basis, it will be more convenient to use option files
to specify for each server those option values that must be unique to it.

@subsection Running Multiple Servers on Windows

You can run multiple servers on Windows by starting them manually from the
command line, each with appropriate operating parameters. On Windows NT-based
systems, you also have the option of installing several servers as Windows services
and running them that way. General instructions for running MySQL servers
from the command line or as services are given in @ref{Windows installation}. This section
describes how to make sure that you start each server with different values for
those startup options that must be unique per server, such as the data
directory.  (These options are described in @ref{Multiple servers}.)

@node Multiple Windows command-line servers, Multiple Windows services, Multiple Windows servers, Multiple Windows servers
@subsubsection Starting Multiple Windows Servers at the Command Line

To start multiple servers manually from the command line, you can specify the appropriate options on
the command line or in an option file. It's more convenient to place the
options in an option file, but it's necessary to make sure that each server
gets its own set of options. To do this, create an option file for each
server and tell the server the filename with a @code{--defaults-file} option
when you run it.

Suppose that you want to run @code{mysqld} on port 3307 with a
data directory of @file{C:\mydata1}, and @code{mysqld-max} on port 3308 with a
data directory of @file{C:\mydata2}. (To do this, make sure that before you
start the servers, each data directory exists and has its own copy fo the
@code{mysql} database that contains the grant tables.)

Then create two option
files. For example, create one file named @file{C:\my-opts1.cnf} that looks
like this:

@example
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata1
port = 3307
@end example

Create a second file named @file{C:\my-opts2.cnf} that looks like this:

@example
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata2
port = 3308
@end example

Then start each server with its own option file:

@example
C:\> mysqld --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
C:\> mysqld-max --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
@end example

On NT, each server will start in the foreground (no new prompt appears until
the server exits later); you'll need to issue those two commands in separate
console windows.

To shut down the servers, you must connect to the appropriate port number:

@example
C:\> mysqladmin --port=3307 shutdown
C:\> mysqladmin --port=3308 shutdown
@end example

Servers configured as just described will allow clients to connect over
TCP/IP.  If your version of Windows supports named pipes and you also want
to allow named pipe connections, use the @code{mysqld-nt} or
@code{mysqld-max-nt} servers and specify options that enable the named pipe
and specify its name. Each server that supports named pipe connections must
use a unique pipe name.  For example, the @file{C:\my-opts1.cnf} file might
be written like this:

@example
[mysqld]
datadir = C:/mydata1
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1
@end example

Then start the server this way:

@example
C:\> mysqld-nt --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
@end example

@file{C:\my-opts2.cnf} would be modified similarly for use by the second
server.

@node Multiple Windows services,  , Multiple Windows command-line servers, Multiple Windows servers
@subsubsection Starting Multiple Windows Servers as Services

On NT-based systems, a MySQL server can be run as a Windows service. The
procedures for installing, controlling, and removing a single MySQL service are
described in @ref{NT start}.

As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can install multiple servers as services.
In this case, you must make sure that each server uses a different
service name in addition to all the other parameters that must be unique per
server.

For the following instructions, assume that you want to run the @code{mysqld-nt}
server from two different versions of MySQL that are installed at
@file{C:\mysql-4.0.8} and @file{C:\mysql-4.0.17}, respectively. (This might be
the case if you're running 4.0.8 as your production server, but want to test
4.0.17 before upgrading to it.)

The following principles apply when installing a MySQL service with the
@code{--install} or @code{--install-manual} option:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you specify no service name, the server uses the default service name of
@code{MySQL} and the server reads options from the @code{[mysqld]} group in
the standard option files.

@item
@c TODO change this back after bug gets fixed
@c If you specify a service name different than @code{MySQL} after the
If you specify a service name after the
@code{--install} option, the server ignores the @code{[mysqld]} option
group and instead reads options from the group that has the same name as the
service. The server reads options from the standard option files.

@item
If you specify a @code{--defaults-file} option after the service name,
the server ignores the standard option files and reads options only from the
@code{[mysqld]} group of the named file.

@end itemize

Note: Before MySQL 4.0.17, only a server installed using the default service
name (@code{MySQL}) or one installed explicitly with a service name of
@code{mysqld} will read the @code{[mysqld]} group in the standard option
files. As of 4.0.17, all servers read the @code{[mysqld]} group if they read
the standard option files, even if they are installed using another service
name. This allows you to use the @code{[mysqld]} group for options that should
be used by all MySQL services, and an option group named after each service
for use by the server installed with that service name.

@c TODO:
@c The following should, I think, be uncommented when the bug is fixed? -- PD
@c (The exception is that if you use an explicit service name of @code{MySQL}
@c or any lettercase variation thereof, only the @code{[mysqld]} group is
@c read. This is because option group names are not case sensitive, and the
@c @code{[mysql]} group is to be used by the @code{mysql} client program, not
@c by any server.)

Based on the preceding information, you have several ways to set
up multiple services.  The following instructions describe some
examples. Before trying any of them, be sure you shut down and
remove any existing MySQL services first.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@strong{Approach 1:}
Specify the options for all services in one of the standard option files.
To do this, use a different service name for each server.
Suppose that you want to run the 4.0.8 @code{mysqld-nt} using the service
name of @code{mysqld1} and the 4.0.17 @code{mysqld-nt} using the service name @code{mysqld2}.
In this case, you can use the @code{[mysqld1]} group for 4.0.8 and the
@code{[mysqld2]} group for 4.0.17.
For example, you can set up @file{C:\my.cnf} like this:

@example
# options for mysqld1 service
[mysqld1]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.8
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1

# options for mysqld2 service
[mysqld2]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.17
port = 3308
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe2
@end example

Install the services as follows, using the full server pathnames to ensure
that Windows registers the correct executable program for each service:

@example
C:\> C:\mysql-4.0.8\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld1
C:\> C:\mysql-4.0.17\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld2
@end example

To start the services, use the services manager, or use @code{NET START}
with the appropriate service names:

@example
C:\> NET START mysqld1
C:\> NET START mysqld2
@end example

To stop the services, use the services manager, or use @code{NET STOP}
with the appropriate service names:

@example
C:\> NET STOP mysqld1
C:\> NET STOP mysqld2
@end example

@item
@strong{Approach 2:}
Specify options for each server in separate files and use
@code{--defaults-file} when you install the services to tell each server
what file to use.  In this case, each file should list options using a
@code{[mysqld]} group.

With this approach, to specify options for the 4.0.8 @code{mysqld-nt},
create a file @file{C:\my-opts1.cnf} that looks like this:

@example
[mysqld]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.8
port = 3307
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe1
@end example

For the 4.0.17 @code{mysqld-nt}, create a file
@file{C:\my-opts2.cnf} that looks like this:

@example
[mysqld]
basedir = C:/mysql-4.0.17
port = 3308
enable-named-pipe
socket = mypipe2
@end example

Install the services as follows (enter each command on a single line):

@example
C:\> C:\mysql-4.0.8\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld1
           --defaults-file=C:\my-opts1.cnf
C:\> C:\mysql-4.0.17\bin\mysqld-nt --install mysqld2
           --defaults-file=C:\my-opts2.cnf
@end example

To use a @code{--defaults-file} option when you install a MySQL server as a
service, you must precede the option with the service name.

After installing the services, start and stop them the same way as in the
preceding example.

@end itemize

To remove multiple services, use @code{mysqld --remove} for each one,
specifying a service name following the @code{--remove} option. If the
service name is the default (@code{MySQL}), you can omit it..


@node Multiple Unix servers, Multiple-server clients, Multiple Windows servers, Multiple servers
@subsection Running Multiple Servers on Unix

The easiest way is to run multiple servers on Unix is to compile them
with different TCP/IP ports and Unix socket files so that each one is listening on
different network interfaces. Also, by compiling in different base directories
for each installation, that automatically results in different compiled-in
data directory, log file, and PID file locations for each of your servers.

Assume that an existing server is configured for the default TCP/IP port
number (3306) and Unix socket file (@file{/tmp/mysql.sock}).  To configure a
new server to have different operating parameters, use a @code{configure}
command something like this:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-tcp-port=port_number \
             --with-unix-socket-path=file_name \
             --prefix=/usr/local/mysql-4.0.17
@end example

Here, @code{port_number} and @code{file_name} must be different from the
default TCP/IP port number and Unix socket file pathname, and the
@code{--prefix} value should specify an installation directory different
than the one under which the existing MySQL installation is located.

If you have a MySQL server listening on a given port number, you can use the
following command to find out what operating parameters it is using for
several important configurable variables, including the base directory and
Unix socket filename:

@example
shell> mysqladmin --host=host_name --port=port_number variables
@end example

With the information displayed by that command, you can tell what option
values @strong{not} to use when configuring an additional server.

Note that if you specify ``@code{localhost}'' as a hostname, @code{mysqladmin}
will default to using a Unix socket file connection rather than TCP/IP.
In MySQL 4.1, you can explicitly specify the connection protocol to use by
using the @code{--protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}} option.

You don't have to compile a new MySQL server just to start with a different
Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number.  It is also possible to specify
those values at runtime. One way to do so is by using command-line options:

@example
shell> /path/to/mysqld_safe --socket=file_name --port=port_number
@end example

To start a second server, provide different @code{--socket} and
@code{--port} option values, and pass a a @code{--datadir=path} option to
@code{mysqld_safe} so that the server uses a different data directory.

Another way to achieve a similar effect is to use environment variables
to set the Unix socket filename and TCP/IP port number:

@tindex @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT} environment variable
@tindex @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT}
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT}
@example
shell> MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/tmp/mysqld-new.sock
shell> MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307
shell> export MYSQL_UNIX_PORT MYSQL_TCP_PORT
shell> scripts/mysql_install_db
shell> bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/path/to/datadir &
@end example

This is a quick way of starting a second server to use
for testing.  The nice thing about this method is that the environment
variable settings will apply to any client programs that you invoke from
the same shell. Thus, connections for those clients automatically will
be directed to the second server!

@ref{Environment variables} includes a list of other environment
variables you can use to affect @code{mysqld}.

For automatic server execution, your startup script that is executed
at boot time should execute the following command once for each
server with an appropriate option file path for each command:

@example
mysqld_safe --defaults-file=path-to-option-file
@end example

Each option file should contain option values specific to a given server.

On Unix,
the @code{mysqld_multi} script is another way to start multiple servers.

@subsection Using Client Programs in a Multiple-Server Environment

When you want to connect with a client program to a MySQL server that is
listening to different network interfaces than those compiled into your
client, you can use one of the following methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Start the client with @code{--host=host_name --port=port_number} to connect
via TCP/IP to a remote server, with @code{--host=127.0.0.1
--port=port_number} to connect via TCP/IP to a local server, or with
@code{--host=localhost --socket=file_name} to connect to a local server via
a Unix socket file or a Windows named pipe.

@item
As of MySQL 4.1, start the client with @code{--protocol=tcp} to connect
via TCP/IP, @code{--protocol=socket} to connect via a Unix socket file,
@code{--protocol=pipe} to connect via a named pipe, or
@code{--protocol=memory} to connect via shared memory.  For TCP/IP
connections, you may also need to specify @code{--host} and @code{--port}
options.  For the other types of connections, you may need to specify
a @code{--socket} option to specify a Unix socket file or named pipe name, or a
@code{--shared-memory-base-name} option to specify the shared memory name.
Shared memory connections are supported only on Windows.

@item
@tindex MYSQL_UNIX_PORT environment variable
@tindex MYSQL_TCP_PORT environment variable
@tindex environment variable, MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
@tindex environment variable, MYSQL_TCP_PORT
On Unix, set the @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT} and @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT}
environment variables to point to the Unix socket file and TCP/IP port
number before you start your clients.  If you normally use a specific socket
file or port number, you can place commands to set these environment
variables in your @file{.login} file so that they apply each time you log
in.
@xref{Environment variables}.

@item
@tindex C:\my.cnf file
@tindex .my.cnf file
Specify the default Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number in the
@code{[client]} group of an option file. For example, you can use
@file{C:\my.cnf} on Windows, or the @file{.my.cnf} file in your home
directory on Unix.
@xref{Option files}.

@item
In a C program, you can specify the socket file or port number arguments in the
@code{mysql_real_connect()} call.  You can also have the program read
option files by calling @code{mysql_options()}.
@xref{C API functions}.

@item
If you are using the Perl @code{DBD::mysql} module, you can read options
from MySQL option files. For example:

@example
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;"
        . "mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf";
$dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password);
@end example

@xref{Perl}.

Other programming interfaces may provide similar capabilities for reading
option files.

@section The MySQL Query Cache

@cindex Query Cache
@cindex @code{SELECT}, Query Cache

From version 4.0.1 on, @code{MySQL Server} features a @code{Query Cache}.
When in use, the query cache stores the text of a @code{SELECT} query
together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client.
If the identical query is received later, the server retrieves
the results from the query cache rather than parsing and executing the
query again.

@strong{Note:} The query cache does not return stale data. When data
is modified, any relevant entries in the query cache are flushed.

The query cache is extremely useful in an environment where (some)
tables don't change very often and you have a lot of identical queries.
This is a typical situation for many Web servers that generate a lot of
dynamic pages based on database content.

@strong{Note:} It doesn't work in an environment where you have many
mysqld servers updating the same MyISAM tables.

Some performance data for the query cache follow. These results were 
generated by running the MySQL benchmark suite on a Linux Alpha
2 x 500MHz with 2GB RAM and a 64MB query cache.

@itemize @bullet

@item
If all of the queries you're performing are simple (such as selecting a row
from a table with one row), but still differ so that the queries cannot be
cached, the overhead for having the query cache active is 13%.  This could
be regarded as the worst case scenario. In real life, queries tend to be
much more complicated, so the overhead is normally significantly lower.

@item
Searches for a single row in a single-row table are 238% faster with the
query cache than without it.  This can be regarded as close to the minimum
speedup to be expected for a query that is cached.

@end itemize

To disable the query cache at server startup, set the
@code{query_cache_size} system variable to 0.  By disabling the query cache
code there is no noticeable overhead.  Query cache capabilities can be
excluded from the server entirely by using the @code{--without-query-cache}
option to @code{configure} when compiling MySQL.

@node Query Cache How, Query Cache in SELECT, Query Cache, Query Cache
@subsection How the Query Cache Operates

This section describes how the query cache works when it is operational.
@ref{Query Cache Configuration} describes how to control whether or not it
is operational.

Queries are compared before parsing, so the following two queries are
regarded as different by the query cache:

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name
Select * from tbl_name
@end example

Queries must
be exactly the same (byte for byte) to be seen as identical.
In addition, query strings that are identical may be treated as different for
otther reasons.
Queries that uses different databases, uses different protocol versions
or different default character sets are considered different
queries and are cached separately.

If a query result is returned from query cache, the server increments the
@code{Qcache_hits} status variable, not @code{Com_select}.
@xref{Query Cache Status and Maintenance}.

If a table changes then all cached queries that used the table become
invalid and are removed from the cache.  This includes queries that use
@code{MERGE} tables that map to the changed table.  A table can be changed
by many types of statements, such as @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE},
@code{DELETE}, @code{TRUNCATE}, @code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{DROP TABLE}, or
@code{DROP DATABASE}.

Transactional @code{InnoDB} tables that have been changed are invalidated
when a @code{COMMIT} is performed.

In MySQL 4.0, the query cache is disabled within transactions (it does
not return results). Beginning with MySQL 4.1.1, the query cache also
works within transactions when using @code{InnoDB} tables (it uses the
table version number to detect whether or not its contents are still current).

Before MySQL 5.0, a query that begins with a leading comment might be cached,
but could not be fetched from the cache. This problem is fixed in MySQL 5.0.

A query cannot be cached if it contains any of the following functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .34
@item @strong{Function}
 @tab @strong{Function}
 @tab @strong{Function}
@item @code{BENCHMARK()}
 @tab @code{CONNECTION_ID()}
 @tab @code{CURDATE()}
@item @code{CURRENT_DATE()}
 @tab @code{CURRENT_TIME()}
 @tab @code{CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()}
@item @code{CURTIME()}
 @tab @code{DATABASE()}
 @tab @code{ENCRYPT()} with one parameter
@item @code{FOUND_ROWS()}
 @tab @code{GET_LOCK()}
 @tab @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}
@item @code{LOAD_FILE()}
 @tab @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()}
 @tab @code{NOW()}
@item @code{RAND()}
 @tab @code{RELEASE_LOCK()}
 @tab @code{SYSDATE()}
@item @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} with no parameters
 @tab @code{USER()}
@end multitable

A query also will not be cached under these conditions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It contains user-defined functions (UDFs).

@item
It contains user variables.

@item
It refers to the tables in the @code{mysql} system database.

@item
It is of any of the following forms:

@example
SELECT ... IN SHARE MODE
SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE ...
SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE ...
SELECT * FROM ... WHERE autoincrement_col IS NULL
@end example

The last form is not cached because it is used as the ODBC workaround for
obtaining the last insert ID value.
@xref{ODBC and last_insert_id}.

@item
It uses @code{TEMPORARY} tables.

@item
It does not use any tables.

@item
The user has a column privilege for any of the involved tables.

Before a query is fetched from the query cache, MySQL checks that
the user has @code{SELECT} privilege for all the involved databases and
tables. If this is not the case, the cached result will not be used.

@end itemize

The query cache does work for @code{SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ...} and
@code{SELECT FOUND_ROWS()} type queries.  @code{FOUND_ROWS()} returns
the correct value even if the preceding query was fetched from the cache
because the number of found rows is also stored in the cache.


@node Query Cache in SELECT, Query Cache Configuration, Query Cache How, Query Cache
@subsection Query Cache @code{SELECT} Options

There are two query cache related options that may be
specified in a @code{SELECT} statement:

@findex SQL_CACHE
@findex SQL_NO_CACHE

@table @code

@item SQL_CACHE
The query result is cached if the value of the @code{query_cache_type}
system variable is @code{ON} or @code{DEMAND}.

@item SQL_NO_CACHE
The query result is not cached.

@end table


@node Query Cache Configuration, Query Cache Status and Maintenance, Query Cache in SELECT, Query Cache
@subsection Query Cache Configuration

Several @code{mysqld} system variables control query cache operation.
These can be set in an option file or on the command line
when starting @code{mysqld}.
The query cache-related system variables all have names that begin with
@code{query_cache_}. They are described briefly in @ref{Server system
variables}, with additional configuration information given here.

To set the size of the query cache, set the @code{query_cache_size} system
variable. Setting it to 0 disables the query cache. The default cache size
is 0; that is, the query cache is disabled.

Assuming that the query cache is enabled, the @code{query_cache_type} variable
influences how it works. This variable can be set to the following values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A value of @code{0} or @code{OFF} prevents caching or retrieval of cached
results.

@item
A value of @code{1} or @code{ON} allows caching except of those statements
that begin with @code{SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE}.

@item
A value of @code{2} or @code{DEMAND} causes caching only of those statements
that begin with @code{SELECT SQL_CACHE}.

@end itemize

Setting the @code{GLOBAL} @code{query_cache_type} determines query cache
behavior for all clients that connect after the change is made. Individual
clients can control cache behavior for their own connection by setting the
@code{SESSION} value of @code{query_cache_type}. For example, a client
can disable use of the query cache for its own queries like this:

@example
mysql> SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF;
@end example

To control the maximum size of individual query results that can be cached,
set the @code{query_cache_limit} variable. The default value is 1MB.

The result of a query (the data sent to the client) is stored in the query
cache during result retrieval. Therefore the data is usually not handled in
one big chunk. The query cache allocates blocks for storing this data on
demand, so when one block is filled, a new block is allocated.  Because
memory allocation operation is costly (time wise), the query cache allocates
blocks with a minimum size given by the @code{query_cache_min_res_unit}
system variable.  When a query is executed, the last result block is trimmed
to the actual data size so that unused memory is freed.
Depending on the types of queries your server executes, you might find it
helpful to tune the value of @code{query_cache_min_res_unit}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The default value of @code{query_cache_min_res_unit} is 4KB. This should
be adequate for most cases.

@item
If you have a lot of queries with small results, the default block size may
lead to memory fragmentation, as indicated by a large number of free blocks.
Fragmentation can cause the query cache to have to delete queries from the
cache due to lack of memory.  In this case, you should decrease the value of
@code{query_cache_min_res_unit}.  The number of free blocks and queries
removed due to pruning are given by the values of the
@code{Qcache_free_blocks} and @code{Qcache_lowmem_prunes} status variables.

@item
If you most of your queries have large results (check the
@code{Qcache_total_blocks} and @code{Qcache_queries_in_cache} status
variables), you can increase performance by increasing
@code{query_cache_min_res_unit}. However, be careful to not make it too
large (see the previous item).

@end itemize

@code{query_cache_min_res_unit} is present from MySQL 4.1.


@node Query Cache Status and Maintenance,  , Query Cache Configuration, Query Cache
@subsection Query Cache Status and Maintenance

@c help_category Administration

You can check whether the query cache is present in your MySQL server using
the following statement:

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';
+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| have_query_cache | YES   |
+------------------+-------+
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic FLUSH QUERY CACHE  CACHE QUERY FLUSH RESET
You can defragment the query cache to better utilize its memory
with the @code{FLUSH QUERY CACHE} statement.
The statement does not remove any queries from the cache.

The @code{RESET QUERY CACHE} statement removes all query results from the
query cache.  The @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement also does this.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

To monitor query cache performance, use @code{SHOW STATUS} to view
the cache status variables:

@example
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Qcache%';
+-------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name           | Value  |
+-------------------------+--------+
| Qcache_free_blocks      | 36     |
| Qcache_free_memory      | 138488 |
| Qcache_hits             | 79570  |
| Qcache_inserts          | 27087  |
| Qcache_lowmem_prunes    | 3114   |
| Qcache_not_cached       | 22989  |
| Qcache_queries_in_cache | 415    |
| Qcache_total_blocks     | 912    |
+-------------------------+--------+
@end example

Descriptions of each of these variables are given in
@ref{Server status variables}.  Some uses for them are described here.

<total number of SELECT queries> =
@code{Com_select} + @code{Qcache_hits} + <queries with errors found by parser>

@code{Com_select} =
@code{Qcache_inserts} + @code{Qcache_not_cached} +
<queries with errors found during fields/rights check>

The query cache uses variable-length blocks, so @code{Qcache_total_blocks}
and @code{Qcache_free_blocks} may indicate query cache memory fragmentation.
After @code{FLUSH QUERY CACHE} only a single free block remains.

Note: Every cached query requires a minimum of two blocks (one for the query
text and one or more for the query results). Also, every table that is used
by a query requires one block. However, if two or more queries use the same
table, only one block needs to be allocated.

The information provided by the @code{Qcache_lowmem_prunes} status variable
can help you tune the query cache size. It counts the number of queries that
have been removed from the cache to free up memory for caching new queries.
The query cache uses a least recently used (LRU) strategy to decide which
queries to remove from the cache. Tuning information is given in @ref{Query
Cache Configuration}.

Replication capabilities allowing the databases on one MySQL server to be
duplicated on another were introduced in MySQL 3.23.15.
This chapter describes the various replication features provided by MySQL.
It introduces replication concepts, shows how to set up replication servers,
and serves as a reference to the available replication options.
It also provides a list of
frequently asked questions (with answers), and troubleshooting advice for
solving problems.

For a description of the syntax of replication-related SQL statements, see
@ref{Replication SQL}.

We suggest that you visit our Web site at @uref{http://www.mysql.com}
often and read updates to this chapter. Replication is constantly being
improved, and we update the manual frequently with the most current
information.

@node Replication Intro, Replication Implementation, Replication, Replication
@section Introduction to Replication

MySQL 3.23.15 and up features support for one-way replication.
One server acts as the master, while one or more other servers
act as slaves.  The master server writes updates to its binary log files,
and maintains an index of the files to keep track of log rotation.  These logs
serve as a record of updates to be sent to slave servers.  When a
slave server connects to the master server, it informs the master of its last
position within the logs since the last successfully propagated update.
The slave catches up any updates that have occurred since then, and then
blocks and waits for the master to notify it of new updates.

A slave server can also serve as a master if you want to set up chained
replication servers.

Note that when you are using replication, all updates to the
tables that are replicated
should be performed on the master server. Otherwise, you must always be
careful to avoid conflicts between updates that users make to tables on the
master and updates that they make to tables on the slave.

One-way replication has benefits for robustness, speed, and system
administration:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Robustness is increased with a master/slave setup.
In the event of problems with the master, you can switch to the slave as a
backup.

@item
Better response time for clients can be achieved by splitting the load
for processing client queries between the master and slave servers.
@code{SELECT} queries may be sent to the slave to reduce the query
processing load of the master. Statements that modify data should still
be sent to the master so that the master and slave do not get out of sync.
This load-balancing strategy is effective if non-updating queries dominate,
but that is the normal case.

@item
Another benefit of using replication is that you can perform backups using a
slave server without disturbing the master. The master continues to process
updates while the backup is being made.
@xref{Backup}.

@end itemize


@node Replication Implementation, Replication Implementation Details, Replication Intro, Replication
@section Replication Implementation Overview

@cindex master/slave setup

MySQL replication is based on the master server keeping track of all changes
to your databases (updates, deletes, and so on) in the binary logs. Therefore,
to use replication, you must enable binary logging on the master server.
@xref{Binary log}.

Each slave server receives from the master the saved updates that the
master has recorded in its binary log, so that the slave can execute the
same updates on its copy of the data.

It is @strong{very important} to realize that the binary log is simply a
record starting from the fixed point in time at which you enable binary
logging. Any slaves that you set up will need copies of the databases on
your master as they existed at the moment you enabled binary
logging on the master. If you start your slaves with databases that are not the same
as what was on the master @strong{when the binary log was
started}, your slaves may fail.

One way to copy the master's data to the slave is to use the @code{LOAD
DATA FROM MASTER} statement.  Be aware that @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}
is available only as of MySQL 4.0.0 and currently works only if all the
tables on the master are @code{MyISAM} type. Also, this statement acquires a
global read lock, so no updates on the master are possible while the tables
are being transferred to the slave. When we implement lock-free hot table
backup (in MySQL 5.0), this global read lock will no longer be necessary.

Due to these limitations, we recommend that at this point  you use
@code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} only if the dataset on the master is relatively
small, or if a prolonged read lock on the master is acceptable. While the
actual speed of @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} may vary from system to system,
a good rule of thumb for how long it will take is 1 second per 1MB of data.
That is only a rough estimate, but you should get close to it if both
master and slave are equivalent to 700MHz Pentium performance and are
connected through a 100MBit/s network.

After the slave has been set up with a copy of the master's data, it
will simply connect to the master and wait for updates to process. If
the master goes away or the slave loses connectivity with your master,
it will keep trying to connect periodically until it is able to reconnect
and resume listening for updates. The retry interval is controlled by the
@code{--master-connect-retry} option. The default is 60 seconds.

Each slave keeps track of where it left off. The master server has no
knowledge of how many slaves there are or which ones are up to date at
any given time.

@end menu

MySQL replication capabilities are implemented using three threads (one
on the master server and two on the slave).  When @code{START SLAVE} is
issued, the slave creates an I/O thread.  The I/O thread connects to the
master and asks it to send the statements recorded in its binary logs. The
master creates a thread to send the binary log contents to the slave.
This thread can be identified as the @code{Binlog Dump} thread in the
output of @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} on the master.  The slave I/O thread
reads what the master @code{Binlog Dump} thread sends and simply copies
it to some local files in the slave's data directory called relay logs.
The third thread is the SQL thread, which the slave creates to read the
relay logs and execute the updates they contain.

In the preceding description, there are three threads per slave. For a
master that has multiple slaves, it creates one thread for each currently
connected slave, and each slave has its own I/O and SQL threads.

For versions of MySQL before 4.0.2, replication involves only two threads
(one on the master and one on the slave). The slave I/O and SQL threads
are combined as a single thread, and no relay log files are used.

The advantage of using two slave threads is that statement reading and
execution are separated into two independent tasks. The task of reading
statements is not slowed down if statement execution is slow.  For example,
if the slave server has not been running for a while, its I/O thread can
quickly fetch all the binary log contents from the master when the slave starts,
even if the SQL thread lags far behind and may take hours to catch up.
If the slave stops before the SQL thread has executed all the fetched
statements, the I/O thread has at least fetched everything so that a
safe copy of the statements is locally stored in the slave's relay logs
for execution when next the slave starts. This allows the binary logs to be
purged on the master, because it no longer need wait for the slave to
fetch their contents.

The @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} statement provides information that tells you
what is happening on the master and on the slave regarding replication.

The following example illustrates how the three threads show up in
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}.  The output format is that used by @code{SHOW
PROCESSLIST} as of MySQL version 4.0.15, when the content of the
@code{State} column was changed to be more meaningful compared to
earlier versions.

On the master server, the output from @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} looks like this:

@example
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 2
   User: root
   Host: localhost:32931
     db: NULL
Command: Binlog Dump
   Time: 94
  State: Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to
         be updated
   Info: NULL
@end example

Here, thread 2 is a replication thread for a connected slave. The information
indicates that all outstanding updates have been sent to the slave and that
the master is waiting for more updates to occur.

On the slave server, the output from @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} looks like this:

@example
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
     Id: 10
   User: system user
   Host:
     db: NULL
Command: Connect
   Time: 11
  State: Waiting for master to send event
   Info: NULL
*************************** 2. row ***************************
     Id: 11
   User: system user
   Host:
     db: NULL
Command: Connect
   Time: 11
  State: Has read all relay log; waiting for the slave I/O
         thread to update it
   Info: NULL
@end example

This information indicates that thread 10 is the I/O thread that is
communicating with the master server, and thread 11 is the SQL thread that
is processing the updates stored in the relay logs.  Currently, both threads
are idle, waiting for further updates.

Note that the value in the @code{Time} column can tell how late the slave
is compared to the master.

Binary logs consist of events, where an event is usually an update statement
plus some other information. The thread has read an event from the binary
log and is sending it to the slave.

@item Finished reading one binlog; switching to next binlog

The thread has finished reading a binary log file and is opening
the next one to send to the slave.

@item Has sent all binlog to slave; waiting for binlog to be updated

The thread has read all outstanding updates from the binary logs and sent
them to the slave. It is idle, waiting for new events to appear in the
binary log resulting from new update statements being executed on the master.

@item Waiting to finalize termination

A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.

@subsection Replication Slave I/O Thread States

The following list shows the most common states you will see in the
@code{State} column for a slave server I/O thread. Beginning with MySQL
4.1.1, this state also appears in the @code{Slave_IO_State} column displayed
by the @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} statement. This means that you can get a
good view of what is happening by using only @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}.

@table @code

@item Connecting to master

The thread is attempting to connect to the master.

@item Checking master version

A very brief state that occurs just after the connection to the master
is established.

@item Registering slave on master

A very brief state that occurs just after the connection to the master
is established.

@item Requesting binlog dump

A very brief state that occurs just after the connection to the master is
established.  The thread sends to the master a request for the contents
of its binary logs, starting from the requested binary log filename and
position.

@item Waiting to reconnect after a failed binlog dump request

If the binary log dump request failed (due to disconnection), the
thread goes into this state while it sleeps, then tries to reconnect
periodically. The interval between retries can
be specified using the
@code{--master-connect-retry} option.

@item Reconnecting after a failed binlog dump request

The thread is trying to reconnect to the master.

@item Waiting for master to send event

The thread has connected to the master and is waiting for binary log events
to arrive. This can last for a long time if the master is idle. If the
wait lasts for @code{slave_read_timeout} seconds, a timeout will occur.
At that point, the thread will consider the connection to be broken and
make an attempt to reconnect.

@item Queueing master event to the relay log

The thread has read an event and is copying it to the relay log so that the SQL
thread can process it.

@item Waiting to reconnect after a failed master event read

An error occurred while reading (due to disconnection). The thread is sleeping
for @code{master-connect-retry} seconds before attempting to reconnect.

@item Reconnecting after a failed master event read

The thread is trying to reconnect to the master. When connection is established
again, the state will become @code{Waiting for master to send event}.

@item Waiting for the slave SQL thread to free enough relay log space

You are using a non-zero @code{relay_log_space_limit} value, and the relay
logs have grown so much that their combined size exceeds this value.
The I/O thread is waiting until the SQL
thread frees enough space by processing relay log contents so that it can
delete some relay log files.

@item Waiting for slave mutex on exit

A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.

@end table


@node Slave SQL thread states, Slave logs, Slave I/O thread states, Replication Implementation Details
@subsection Replication Slave SQL Thread States

The following list shows the most common states you will see in the
@code{State} column for a slave server SQL thread:

@table @code

@item Reading event from the relay log

The thread has read an event from the relay log so that it can process it.

@item Has read all relay log; waiting for the slave I/O thread to update it

The thread has processed all events in the relay log files and is waiting for
the I/O thread to write new events to the relay log.

@item Waiting for slave mutex on exit

A very brief state that occurs as the thread is stopping.

@end table

The @code{State} column for the I/O thread may also show the text of
a statement.  This indicates that the thread has read an event from the
relay log, extracted the statement from it, and is executing it.


@node Slave logs,  , Slave SQL thread states, Replication Implementation Details
@subsection Replication Relay and Status Files

By default, relay logs are named using filenames of the form
@file{host_name-relay-bin.nnn}, where @code{host_name} is the name of the
slave server host and @code{nnn} is a sequence number.
Successive relay log files are created using successive sequence numbers,
beginning with @code{001}.
The slave keeps track of relay logs currently in use in an index file.
The default relay log index filename is
@file{host_name-relay-bin.index}.
By default, these files are created in the slave's data directory.
The default filenames may be overridden with the @code{--relay-log} and
@code{--relay-log-index} server options.
@xref{Replication Options}.

Relay logs have the same format as binary logs, so you can use
@code{mysqlbinlog} to read them.  A relay log is automatically deleted by
the SQL thread as soon as it has executed all its events and no longer needs
it). There is no explicit mechanism for deleting relay logs, because the SQL
thread takes care of doing so. However, from MySQL 4.0.14, @code{FLUSH LOGS}
rotates relay logs, which will influence when the SQL thread deletes them.

A new relay log is created under the following conditions:

@itemize @bullet

@item
When the I/O thread starts for the first time
after the slave server starts.
(In MySQL 5.0, a new relay log is created each time the I/O thread
starts, not just the first time.)

@item
When the logs are flushed; for example, with @code{FLUSH LOGS} or
@code{mysqladmin flush-logs}. (This creates a new relay log only as of MySQL
4.0.14.)

@item
When the size of the current relay log file becomes too large. The meaning of
``too large'' is determined as follows:
@itemize @minus
@item
@code{max_relay_log_size}, if @code{max_relay_log_size} > 0
@item
@code{max_binlog_size}, if @code{max_relay_log_size} = 0
or MySQL is older than 4.0.14
@end itemize

@end itemize

A slave replication server creates two additional small files in the
data directory.  These are status files and are named @file{master.info}
and @file{relay-log.info} by default.  They contain information like
that shown in the output of the @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} statement
(@pxref{Replication Slave SQL} for a description of this statement).
As disk files, they survive a slave server's shutdown. The next time the
slave starts up, it reads these files to determine how far it has proceeded
in reading binary logs from the master and in processing its own relay logs.

The @file{master.info} file is updated by the I/O thread.
Before MySQL 4.1,
the correspondence between the lines in the file and the
columns displayed by @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} is as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @strong{Line} @tab @strong{Description}
@item 1              @tab @code{Master_Log_File}
@item 2              @tab @code{Read_Master_Log_Pos}
@item 3              @tab @code{Master_Host}
@item 4              @tab @code{Master_User}
@item 5              @tab Password (not shown by @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS})
@item 6              @tab @code{Master_Port}
@item 7              @tab @code{Connect_Retry}
@end multitable

As of MySQL 4.1, the file includes a line count and information about
SSL options:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @strong{Line} @tab @strong{Description}
@item 1              @tab Number of lines in the file

@c TODO: This stuff about backups is out of place. We haven't even
@c described how to set up replication yet, much less worry about backups.
@c Create a new Backup Issues within this chapter?

When you back up your slave's data, you should back up these two small files
as well, along with the relay log files. They are needed to resume
replication after you restore the slave's data.  If you lose the relay logs
but still have the @file{relay-log.info} file, you can check it to determine
how far the SQL thread has executed in the master binary logs. Then you
can use @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} with the @code{MASTER_RELAY_LOG} and
@code{MASTER_RELAY_POS} options to tell the slave to reread the binary
logs from that point.  This requires that the binary logs still exist on
the master server.

If your slave is subject to replicating @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statements,
you should also back up any @file{SQL_LOAD-*} files that exist in the
directory that the slave uses for this purpose.  The slave needs these files
to resume replication of any interrupted @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operations.
The directory location is specified using the @code{--slave-load-tmpdir}
option.  Its default value, if not specified, is the value of the @code{tmpdir}
variable.

@node Replication HOWTO, Replication Compatibility, Replication Implementation Details, Replication
@section How to Set Up Replication

@c TODO: somewhere mention in here that --slave-load-tmpdir should be set
@c to a disk-based directory that isn't cleared when machine restarts.
@c /tmp not a good choice.

Here is a quick description of how to set up complete replication of
your current MySQL server. It assumes that you want to replicate all
your databases and have not configured replication before. You will need
to shut down your master server briefly to complete the steps outlined
here.

The procedure is written in terms of setting up a single slave, but you can
use it to set up multiple slaves.

While this method is the most straightforward way to set up a slave,
it is not the only one. For example, if you already have a snapshot
of the master's data, and
the master already has its server ID set and binary logging enabled, you can
set up a slave without shutting down the master or even blocking updates to it.
For more details, please see @ref{Replication FAQ}.

If you want to administer a MySQL replication setup, we suggest that
you read this entire chapter through and try all statements mentioned in
@ref{Replication Master SQL} and @ref{Replication Slave SQL}.  You should
also familiarize yourself with replication startup options described in
@ref{Replication Options}.

Note that this procedure and some of the replication SQL statements
in later sections refer to the @code{SUPER} privilege. Prior to MySQL
4.0.2, use the @code{PROCESS} privilege instead.

@enumerate
@item
Make sure that you have a recent version of MySQL installed on the master
and slaves, and that these versions are compatible according to the table
shown in @ref{Replication Compatibility}.

Please do not report bugs until you have verified that the problem is present
in the latest release.

@item
Set up an account on the master server that the slave server can use to
connect. This account must be given the @code{REPLICATION SLAVE} privilege.
If the account is used only for replication
(which is recommended), you don't need to grant any additional privileges.

Suppose that your domain is @code{mydomain.com} and you want to create an
account with a username of @code{repl} such that slave servers can use the
account to access the master server from any host in your domain using a
password of @code{slavepass}.
To create the account, this use @code{GRANT} statement:

@example
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.*
    -> TO 'repl'@@'%.mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'slavepass';
@end example

For MySQL versions older than 4.0.2, the @code{REPLICATION CLIENT} privilege
does not exist. Grant the @code{FILE} privilege instead:

@example
mysql> GRANT FILE ON *.*
    -> TO 'repl'@@'%.mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'slavepass';
@end example

If you plan to use the @code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} or @code{LOAD DATA
FROM MASTER} statements from the slave host, you will need to grant this
account additional privileges:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Grant the account the @code{SUPER} and @code{RELOAD} global privileges.

@item
Grant the @code{SELECT} privilege for all tables that
you want to load. Any master tables from which the account cannot
@code{SELECT} will be ignored by @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}.
@end itemize

@item
If you are using only @code{MyISAM} tables, flush all the tables and block
write statements by executing a @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} statement.

@example
mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
@end example

Leave the client running from which you issue the @code{FLUSH TABLES}
statement so that the read lock remains in effect. (If you exit the client,
the lock is released.) Then take a snapshot of the data on your master server.

The easiest way to create a snapshot is to use an archiving program to make a
binary backup of the databases in your master's data directory. 
For example, use @code{tar} on Unix, or @code{PowerArchiver}, @code{WinRAR},
@code{WinZip}, or any similar software on Windows.
To use @code{tar} to create an archive that includes all
databases, change location into the master server's data directory, then
execute this command:

@example
shell> tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar .
@end example

If you want the archive to include only a database called @code{this_db}, use
this command instead:

@example
shell> tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar ./this_db
@end example

Then copy the archive file to the @file{/tmp} directory on the slave server
host. On that machine, change location into the slave's data directory, and
unpack the archive file using this command:

@example
shell> tar -xvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar
@end example

You may not want to replicate the @code{mysql} database if the slave
server has a different set of user accounts from those that exist on the
master. In this case, you should exclude it from the archive. You also
need not include any log files in the archive, or the @file{master.info}
or @file{relay-log.info} files.

While the read lock placed by @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} is in effect,
read the value of the current binary log name and offset on the master:

@example
mysql > SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File          | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysql-bin.003 | 73       | test         | manual,mysql     |
+---------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
@end example

The @code{File} column shows the name of the log,  while @code{Position} shows
the offset. In this example, the binary log value is
@code{mysql-bin.003} and the offset is 73. Record the values. You will need
to use them later when you are setting up the slave. They represent the
replication coordinates at which the slave should begin processing new updates
from the master.

After you have taken the snapshot and recorded the log name and offset,
you can re-enable write activity on the master:

@example
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

If you are using @code{InnoDB} tables, ideally you should use the @code{InnoDB Hot
Backup} tool.  It takes a consistent snapshot without acquiring any locks on
the master server, and records the log name and offset corresponding to the
snapshot to be later used on the slave.  @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} is a non-free
(commercial) additional tool that is not included in the standard MySQL distribution.
See the @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} homepage at @uref{http://www.innodb.com/manual.php}
for detailed information and screenshots.

Without the @code{Hot Backup} tool, the quickest way to take a binary snapshot
of @code{InnoDB} tables is to shut down the master server and copy the
@code{InnoDB} data files, log files, and table definition files (@code{.frm}
files). To record the current log file name and offset, you should issue
the following statements before you shut down the server:

@example
mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
@end example

Then record the log name and the offset from the output of @code{SHOW MASTER
STATUS} as was shown earlier. After recording the log name and the offset,
shut down the server @emph{without} unlocking the tables to make sure that the
server goes down with the snapshot corresponding to the current log file
and offset:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -u root shutdown
@end example

An alternative that works for both @code{MyISAM} and @code{InnoDB}
tables is to take an SQL dump of the master instead of a binary copy as
described in the preceding discussion. For this, you can use @code{mysqldump
--master-data} on your master and later load the SQL dump file into your
slave. However, this is slower than doing a binary copy.

If the master has been previously running without @code{--log-bin} enabled,
the log name and position values displayed by @code{SHOW MASTER STATUS}
or @code{mysqldump} will be empty. In that case, the values that you will
need to use later when specifying the slave's log file and position are
the empty string (@code{''}) and @code{4}.

@item
Make sure that the @code{[mysqld]} section of the @file{my.cnf} file on
the master host includes a @code{log-bin} option. The section should also
have a @code{server-id=master_id} option, where @code{master_id} must be
a positive integer value from 1 to 2^32 @minus{} 1. For example:

@example
[mysqld]
log-bin
server-id=1
@end example

If those options are not present, add them and restart the server.


@item
Stop the server that is to be used as a slave server and add the following to
its @file{my.cnf} file:

@example
[mysqld]
server-id=slave_id
@end example

The @code{slave_id} value, like the @code{master_id} value, must
be a positive integer value from 1 to 2^32 @minus{} 1. In addition, it is very
important that the ID of the slave be different from the ID of the
master. For example:

@example
[mysqld]
server-id=2
@end example

If you are setting up multiple slaves, each one must have a unique
@code{server-id} value that differs from that of the master and from each
of the other slaves.  Think of @code{server-id} values as something similar
to IP addresses: These IDs uniquely identify each server instance in the
community of replication partners.

If you don't specify a @code{server-id} value, it will be set to 1 if
you have not defined @code{master-host}, else it will be set to 2. Note
that in the case of @code{server-id} omission, a master will refuse
connections from all slaves, and a slave will refuse to connect to a
master. Thus, omitting @code{server-id} is good only for backup with a
binary log.

@item
If you made a binary backup of the master server's data, copy it to the
slave server's data directory before starting the slave.  Make sure that the
privileges on the files and directories are correct. The user that the server
MySQL runs as must able to read and write the files, just as on the master.

If you made a backup using @code{mysqldump}, start the slave first (see next
step).

@item
Start the slave server. If it has been replicating previously,
start the slave server with the @code{--skip-slave-start} option so that it
doesn't immediately try to connect to its master.
You also may want to start the slave server with the
@code{--log-warnings} option, to get more messages about
problems (for example, network or connection problems).

@item
If you made a backup of the master server's data using @code{mysqldump}, load
the dump file into the slave server:

@example
shell> mysql -u root -p < dump_file.sql
@end example

@item
Execute the following statement on the slave, replacing the option values
with the actual values relevant to your system:

@example
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     MASTER_HOST='master_host_name',
    ->     MASTER_USER='replication_user_name',
    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='replication_password',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_file_name',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=recorded_log_position;
@end example

The following table shows the maximum length for the string options:

@multitable @columnfractions .40 .20
@item @code{MASTER_HOST}     @tab 60
@item @code{MASTER_USER}     @tab 16
@item @code{MASTER_PASSWORD} @tab 32
@item @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} @tab 255
@end multitable

@item
Start the slave threads:

@example
mysql> START SLAVE; 
@end example

@end enumerate

After you have performed this procedure, the slave should connect to the master
and catch up on any updates that have occurred since the snapshot was taken.

If you have forgotten to set the @code{server-id} value for the master, slaves will
not be able to connect to it.

If you have forgotten to set the @code{server-id} value for the slave, you will get
the following error in its error log:

@example
Warning: one should set server_id to a non-0 value if
master_host is set.  The server will not act as a slave.
@end example

You will also find error messages in the slave's error log if it
is not able to replicate for any other reason.

Once a slave is replicating, you will find in its data directory one
file named
@file{master.info} and another named @file{relay-log.info}.
The slave uses these two files to keep track of how much
of the master's binary log it has processed. @strong{Do not} remove or
edit these files, unless you really know what you are doing and understand
the implications. Even in that case,
it is preferred that you use the @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statement.

@strong{Note:} The content of @file{master.info} overrides some
options specified on the command line or in @file{my.cnf}
See @ref{Replication Options} for more details.

Once you have a snapshot, you can use it to set up other slaves by
following the slave portion of the procedure just described. You do not need to
take another snapshot of the master; you can use the same one for each slave.


@node Replication Compatibility, Replication Upgrade, Replication HOWTO, Replication
@section Replication Compatibility Between MySQL Versions

The original binary log format was developed in MySQL 3.23. It changed in
MySQL 4.0, and again in MySQL 5.0. This has consequences when you upgrade
servers in a replication setup, as described in @ref{Replication Upgrade}.

As far as replication is concerned, any MySQL 4.1.x version and any 4.0.x
version are identical, because they all use the same binary log format.
Thus, any servers from these versions are compatible, and replication between
them should work seamlessly.
The exceptions to this compatibility is that versions from MySQL 4.0.0 to
4.0.2 were very early development versions that should not be used anymore.
(These were the alpha versions in the 4.0 release series.  Compatibility for
them is still documented in the manual included with their distributions.)

The following table indicates master/slave replication compatibility between
different versions of MySQL.

As a general rule, we recommended using recent MySQL versions,
because replication capabilities are continually being improved.
We also recommend using the same version for both the master and the slave.

@subsection Upgrading Replication to 4.0 or 4.1

This section applies to upgrading replication from MySQL 3.23 to 4.0 or 4.1.
A 4.0 server should be 4.0.3 or newer, as mentioned in @ref{Replication
Compatibility}.

When you upgrade a master from MySQL 3.23 to MySQL 4.0 or 4.1, you should
first ensure that all the slaves of this master are already at 4.0 or 4.1. If
that is not the case, you should first upgrade your slaves: Shut down each
one, upgrade it, restart it, and restart replication.


The upgrade can safely be done using the following procedure, assuming that you
have a 3.23 master to upgrade and the slaves are 4.0 or 4.1.  Note that
after the master has been upgraded, you should not restart replication using
any old 3.23 binary logs, because this will unfortunately confuse the 4.0 or
4.1 slave.

@enumerate
@item
Block all updates on the master by issuing a @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK}
statement.
@item
Wait until all the slaves have caught up with all changes from the master
server.
Use @code{SHOW MASTER STATUS} on the master to obtain its current binary log
file and position. Then, for each slave, use those values with a @code{SELECT
MASTER_POS_WAIT()} statement. The statement will block on the slave and return
when the slave has caught up. Then run @code{STOP SLAVE} on the slave.
@item
Stop the master server and upgrade it to MySQL 4.0 or 4.1.
@item
Restart the master server and record the name of its newly
created binary log. You can obtain the name of the file by issuing a
@code{SHOW MASTER STATUS} statement on the master. Then issue these
statements on each slave:

@example
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='binary_log_name',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
mysql> START SLAVE;
@end example

@end enumerate

@subsection Upgrading Replication to 5.0

This section applies to upgrading replication from MySQL 3.23, 4.0, or 4.1
to 5.0.0.  A 4.0 server should be 4.0.3 or newer, as mentioned in
@ref{Replication Compatibility}.

First, note that MySQL 5.0.0 is an alpha release. It is intended to work
better than older versions (easier upgrade, replication of some important
session variables such as @code{sql_mode}; see @ref{News-5.0.0}).  However
it has not yet been extensively tested. As with any alpha release, we
recommend that you not use it in critical production environments yet.

When you upgrade a master from MySQL 3.23 or 4.0 or 4.1 to 5.0.0, you should
first ensure that all the slaves of this master are already 5.0.0. If that's
not the case, you should first upgrade your slaves.  To upgrade each slave,
just shut it down, upgrade it to 5.0.0, restart it, and restart replication.
The 5.0.0 slave will be able to read its old relay logs that were written
before the upgrade and execute the statements they contain. Relay logs
created by the slave after the upgrade will be in 5.0.0 format.

After the slaves have been upgraded, shut down your master, upgrade it to
5.0.0, and restart it.  The 5.0.0 master will be able to read its old binary
logs that were written before the upgrade and send them to the 5.0.0 slaves.
The slaves will recognize the old format and handle it properly. Binary logs
created by master after the upgrade will be in 5.0.0 format. These too will
be recognized by the 5.0.0 slaves.

In other words, there are no measures to take when upgrading to 5.0.0,
except that slaves must be 5.0.0 before you can upgrade the master to 5.0.0.
Note that downgrading from 5.0.0 to older versions does not work so
automatically: You must ensure that any 5.0.0 binary logs or relay logs have
been fully processed, so that you can remove them before proceeding with the
downgrade.

@cindex files, @file{my.cnf}

The following list explains
what is supported and what is not.
Additional @code{InnoDB}-specific information about replication is given in
@ref{InnoDB and MySQL Replication,  , @code{InnoDB} and MySQL Replication}.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Replication will be done correctly with @code{AUTO_INCREMENT},
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} values.

@item
The @code{USER()}, @code{UUID()}, and @code{LOAD_FILE()} functions
are replicated without changes and will thus not work reliably on the
slave. This is also true for @code{CONNECTION_ID()} in slave versions
older than 4.1.1.
The @strong{new} @code{PASSWORD()} function in MySQL 4.1 is well
replicated in masters from 4.1.1 and up; your slaves also must be 4.1.1 or above
to replicate it. If you have older slaves and need to replicate
@code{PASSWORD()} from your 4.1.x master, you must start your master
with the @code{--old-password} option, so that it uses the old implementation
of @code{PASSWORD()}. (Note that the @code{PASSWORD()} implementation in
MySQL 4.1.0 differs from every other version of MySQL. It is best to avoid
4.1.0 in a replication situation.)

@item
The @code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} variable is replicated as of version 4.0.14.
The @code{sql_mode}, @code{UNIQUE_CHECKS}, and @code{SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL}
variables are replicated as of 5.0.0.  The @code{SQL_SELECT_LIMIT} and
@code{table_type} variables are not yet replicated.

@item
You must use the same character set (@code{--default-character-set})
on the master and the slave. Otherwise, you may get duplicate-key errors on
the slave, because a key that is regarded as unique in the master character
set may not be unique in the slave character set. Character sets will
be replicated in 5.0.x.

@item
It is possible to replicate transactional tables on the master using
non-transactional tables on the slave. For example, you can replicate an
@code{InnoDB} master table as a @code{MyISAM} slave table. However, if you do
this, you will have problems if
the slave is stopped in the middle of a @code{BEGIN/COMMIT} block, because
the slave will restart at the beginning of the @code{BEGIN} block.
This issue is on our TODO and will be fixed in the near future.

@item
Update statements that make use of user variables (that is, variables of the
form @code{@@var_name}) are badly replicated in 3.23 and 4.0. This is fixed
in 4.1. Note that user variable names are case insensitive starting from
version 5.0.  You should take this into account when setting up replication
between 5.0 and an older version.

@item
The slave can connect to the master using SSL if
both are 4.1.1 or newer.

@item
If a @code{DATA DIRECTORY} or @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} clause is used in a
@code{CREATE TABLE} statement on the master server, the clause is also used
on the slave. This can cause problems if no corresponding directory exists
in the slave host filesystem or exists but is not accessible to the slave
server.  Starting from MySQL 4.0.15, there is a @code{sql_mode} option
called @code{NO_DIR_IN_CREATE}. If the slave server is run with its SQL mode
set to include this option, it will simply ignore the clauses before
replicating the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.  The result is that the
@code{MyISAM} data and index files are created in the table's database
directory.

@item
Although we have never heard of it actually occurring, it is theoretically
possible for the data on the master and slave to become different if a
query is designed in such a way that the data modification is
non-deterministic; that is, left to the will of the query optimizer. (That
generally is not a good practice anyway, even outside of replication!)
For a detailed explanation of this issue, see
@ref{Open bugs}.

@item
Before MySQL 4.1.1,
@code{FLUSH}, @code{ANALYZE}, @code{OPTIMIZE}, and @code{REPAIR} statements
are not written to the binary log and thus are
not replicated to the slaves. This is not normally a problem as
these statements do not modify table data. However, it can cause difficulties
under certain circumstances. If you
replicate the privilege tables in the @code{mysql} database and
update those tables directly without using the
@code{GRANT} statement, you
must issue a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement on your slaves to put
the new privileges into effect. Also if you use
@code{FLUSH TABLES} when renaming a @code{MyISAM} table that is part of a
@code{MERGE} table, you will have to issue @code{FLUSH TABLES}
manually on the slaves.
As of MySQL 4.1.1, these statements are written to the binary log
(unless you specify @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG}, or its alias @code{LOCAL}).
Exceptions are that @code{FLUSH LOGS}, @code{FLUSH MASTER},
@code{FLUSH SLAVE}, and @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} are not logged in
any case.  (Any of them may cause problems if replicated to a slave.)
For a syntax example, see @ref{FLUSH, , @code{FLUSH}}.

@item
MySQL only supports one master and many slaves. Later we will
add a voting algorithm to automatically change master if something goes
wrong with the current master. We will also introduce ``agent'' processes
to help do load balancing by sending @code{SELECT} queries to different
slaves.

@item
When a server shuts down and restarts, its @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables become empty.
As of MySQL 4.0.18, the master replicates this effect as follows:
The first time that the master uses each @code{MEMORY} table after startup,
it notifies slaves that the table needs to be emptied by writing a
@code{DELETE FROM} for the table to its binary log.
See @ref{HEAP,  , @code{HEAP}} for more details.

@item
Temporary tables are replicated with the exception of the case that you
shut down the slave server (not just the slave threads) and you have some
replicated temporary tables that are used in update statements that have
not yet been executed on the slave.  If you shut down the slave server,
the temporary tables needed by those updates no longer are available when
the slave starts again.  To avoid this problem, do not shut down the
slave while it has temporary tables open. Instead, use this procedure:

@enumerate

@item
Issue a @code{STOP SLAVE} statement.

@item
Use @code{SHOW STATUS} to check the value of the @code{Slave_open_temp_tables}
variable.

@item
If the value is 0, issue a @code{mysqladmin shutdown} command to
shut down the slave.

@item
If the value is not 0, restart the slave threads with @code{START SLAVE}.

@item
Repeat the procedure later to see if you have better luck next time.

@end enumerate

We have plans to fix this problem in the near future.

@item
It is safe to connect servers in a circular
master/slave relationship with the @code{--log-slave-updates} option specified.
Note, however, that many statements will not work correctly in this kind of
setup unless your client code is written to take care of the potential
problems that can occur from updates that occur in different sequence
on different servers.

This means that you can create a setup such as this:

@example
A -> B -> C -> A
@end example

Server IDs are encoded in the binary log events, so server A will know when
an event that it reads was originally created by itself and will not
execute the event (unless server A was started with the
@code{--replicate-same-server-id} option, which is meaningful only in rare
setups). Thus, there will be no infinite loop.  But this circular
setup will work only if you perform no conflicting
updates between the tables.  In other words, if you insert data in both
A and C, you should never insert a row in A that may have a key that
conflicts with with a row inserted in C.  You should also not update
the same rows on two servers if the order in which the updates are
applied is significant.

@item
If a statement on the slave produces an error, the slave SQL thread
terminates, and the slave writes a message to its error log. You should
then connect to the slave manually, fix the problem (for
example, a non-existent table), and then run @code{START SLAVE}.

@item
It is safe to shut down a master server and restart it later.
If a slave loses its connection to the master, the slave tries to reconnect
immediately. If that fails, the slave retries periodically. (The default is
to retry every 60 seconds. This may be changed with the
@code{--master-connect-retry} option.)
The slave will also be able to deal with
network connectivity outages. However, the slave will notice the
network outage only after receiving no data from the master for
@code{slave_net_timeout} seconds. If your outages are short, you may want
to decrease @code{slave_net_timeout}.
@xref{Server system variables}.

@item
Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track of where
it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems, especially if disk
cache was not flushed to disk before the system went down. Your system fault
tolerance will be greatly increased if you have a good uninterruptible power
supply.

@item
Due to the non-transactional nature of @code{MyISAM} tables, it is possible
to have a statement that only partially updates a table and returns an
error code. This can happen, for example, on a multiple-row insert that has
one row violating a key constraint, or if a long update statement is killed
after updating some of the rows. If that happens on the master, the slave
thread will exit and wait for the DBA to decide what to do about it unless
the error code is legitimate and the statement execution results in the same
error code. If this error code validation behavior is not desirable, some or
all errors can be masked out (ignored) with the @code{--slave-skip-errors}
option.  This option is available starting with MySQL 3.23.47.

@item
If you update transactional tables from non-transactional tables inside a
@code{BEGIN/COMMIT} segment, updates to the binary log may be out of sync
if some thread changes the non-transactional table before the
transaction commits.  This is because the transaction is written to the
binary log only when it is committed.

@item
Before version 4.0.15, any update to a non-transactional table is written to
the binary log at once when the update is made, whereas transactional
updates are written on @code{COMMIT} or not written at all if you use
@code{ROLLBACK}. You must take this into account when updating both
transactional tables and non-transactional tables within the same
transaction. (This is true not only for replication, but also if you are
using binary logging for backups.) In version 4.0.15, we changed the logging
behavior for transactions that mix updates to transactional and
non-transactional tables, which solves the problems (order of statements is
good in the binary log, and all needed statements are written to the binary log
even in case of @code{ROLLBACK}). The problem that remains is when a second
connection updates the non-transactional table while the first connection's
transaction is not finished yet; wrong order can still occur, because the
second connection's update will be written immediately after it is done.

@item
When a 4.x slave replicates a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} from a 3.23 master, the
values of the @code{Exec_Master_Log_Pos} and @code{Relay_Log_Space} columns of
@code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} become incorrect.
The incorrectness of @code{Exec_Master_Log_Pos} will cause a problem when you
stop and restart replication; so it is a good idea to correct the value before
this, by doing @code{FLUSH LOGS} on the master.
These bugs are already fixed in MySQL 5.0.0 slaves.

@end itemize

The following table lists replication problems in MySQL 3.23 that are
fixed in MySQL 4.0:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} is handled properly, as long as the data file
still resides on the master server at the time of update
propagation.

@item
@code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} is no longer skipped on the slave as it
was in 3.23.

@item
In 3.23, @code{RAND()} in updates does not replicate properly.
Use @code{RAND(some_non_rand_expr)} if you are replicating updates with
@code{RAND()}. You can, for example, use @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} for the
argument to @code{RAND()}.
@end itemize


@node Replication Options, Replication FAQ, Replication Features, Replication
@section Replication Startup Options

@c TODO: This section says that it describes slave options, but there
@c are master options that need to be listed as well, like
@c show-slave-auth-info.

@c TODO: There really should be a separate section devoted to the use
@c and structure of master.info, and how it interacts with startup options.

On both the master and the slave, you must use the @code{server-id} option
to establish a unique replication ID for each server. You should pick a unique
positive integer in the range from 1 to 2^32 @minus{} 1 for each master and slave.
Example: @code{server-id=3}

The options that you can use on the master server for controlling binary
logging are described in @ref{Binary log}.

The following table describes the options you can use on slave replication servers.
You can specify them on the command line or in an option file.

Some slave server replication options are handled in a special way, in the
sense that they are ignored if a @file{master.info} file exists when the slave
starts and contains values for the options.
The following options are handled this way:

@itemize
@item @code{--master-host}
@item @code{--master-user}
@item @code{--master-password}
@item @code{--master-port}
@item @code{--master-connect-retry}
@end itemize

As of MySQL 4.1.1, the following options also are handled specially:

@itemize
@item @code{--master-ssl}
@item @code{--master-ssl-ca}
@item @code{--master-ssl-capath}
@item @code{--master-ssl-cert}
@item @code{--master-ssl-cipher}
@item @code{--master-ssl-key}
@end itemize

The @file{master.info} file format in 4.1.1 changed to include values
corresponding to the SSL options. In addition, the 4.1.1 file format includes
as its first line the number of lines in the file. If you upgrade an older
server to 4.1.1, the new server upgrades the @file{master.info} file to the
new format automatically when it starts.  However, if you downgrade a 4.1.1
or newer server to a version older than 4.1.1, you should manually remove
the first line before starting the older server for the first time.  Note
that, in this case, the downgraded server no longer can use an SSL connection
to communicate with the master.

If no @file{master.info} file exists when the slave server starts,
it uses values for those options that are specified in option files
or on the command line.  This will occur when you start the server
as a replication slave for the very first time, or when you have run
@code{RESET SLAVE} and shut down and restarted the slave server.

If the @file{master.info} file exists when the slave server starts, the
server ignores those options. Instead, it uses the values found in the
@file{master.info} file.

If you restart the slave server with different values of the startup options
that correspond to values in the @file{master.info} file, the different
values have no effect, because the server continues to use the
@file{master.info} file. To use different values, you must either restart
after removing the @file{master.info} file or (preferably) use the
@code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statement to reset the values while the slave is
running.

Suppose that you specify this option in your @file{my.cnf} file:

@example
[mysqld]
master-host=some_host
@end example

The first time you start the server as a replication slave, it reads and
uses that option from the @file{my.cnf} file.  The server then records the
value in the @file{master.info} file.  The next time you start the server,
it reads the master host value from the @file{master.info} file only and
ignores the value in the option file.  If you modify the @file{my.cnf} file
to specify a different master host of @code{some_other_host}, the change
still will have no effect.  You should use @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} instead.

Because the server gives an existing @file{master.info} file precedence
over the startup options just described, you might prefer not to use startup
options for these values at all, and instead specify them by using the
@code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statement.
See @ref{CHANGE MASTER TO,  , @code{CHANGE MASTER TO}}.

This example shows a more extensive use of startup options to configure a
slave server:

@example
[mysqld]
server-id=2
master-host=db-master.mycompany.com
master-port=3306
master-user=pertinax
master-password=freitag
master-connect-retry=60
report-host=db-slave.mycompany.com
@end example

The following list describes startup options for controlling replication:
Many of these options can be reset while the server is running by using the
@code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statement. Others, such as the @code{--replicate-*}
options, can be set only when the slave server starts. We plan to fix this.

@table @code

@item --log-slave-updates
Normally, updates received from a master server by a slave are not logged to
its binary log. This option tells the slave to log the updates performed by
its SQL thread to the slave's own binary log.  For this option to have any
effect, the slave must also be started with the @code{--log-bin} option to
enable binary logging.  @code{--log-slave-updates} is used when you want to
chain replication servers.  For example, you might want a setup like this:

@example
A -> B -> C
@end example

That is, A serves as the master for the slave B, and B serves as the master
for the slave C. For this to work, B must be both a master and a slave.
You must start both A and B with @code{--log-bin} to enable binary logging,
and B with the @code{--log-slave-updates} option.

@item --log-warnings
Makes the slave print more messages about what it is doing. For
example, it will warn you that it succeeded in reconnecting after a
network/connection failure, and warn you about how each slave thread started.
This option is enabled by default as of MySQL 4.1.2; to disable it, use
@code{--skip-log-warnings}.

This option is not limited to replication use only. It produces warnings
across a spectrum of server activities.

@item --master-connect-retry=seconds
The number of seconds the slave thread sleeps before retrying to connect to
the master in case the master goes down or the connection is lost.  The
value in the @file{master.info} file takes precedence if it can be read.  If
not set, the default is 60.

@item --master-host=host
The hostname or IP number of the master replication server.
If this option is not given, the slave
thread will not be started.  The value in @file{master.info}
takes precedence if it can be read.

@item --master-info-file=file_name
The name to use for the file in which the slave records
information about the master.
The default name is @file{mysql.info} in the data directory.

@item --master-password=password
The password of the account that the slave thread uses for authentication when
connecting to the master.
The value in the @file{master.info} file takes precedence if it can be read.
If not set, an empty password is assumed.

@item --master-port=port_number
The TCP/IP port the master is listening on.
The value in the @file{master.info} file takes precedence if it can be read.
If not set, the compiled-in setting is assumed. If you have not tinkered with
@code{configure} options, this should be 3306.

@item --master-ssl
@itemx --master-ssl-ca=file_name
@itemx --master-ssl-capath=directory_name
@itemx --master-ssl-cert=file_name
@itemx --master-ssl-cipher=cipher_list
@itemx --master-ssl-key=file_name

These options are used for setting up a secure replication connection to
the master server using SSL.
Their meanings are the same as the corresponding
@code{--ssl},
@code{--ssl-ca},
@code{--ssl-capath},
@code{--ssl-cert},
@code{--ssl-cipher},
@code{--ssl-key}
options described in
@ref{SSL options}.
The values in the @file{master.info} file take precedence if they can be read.

These options are operational as of MySQL 4.1.1.

@item --master-user=username
The username of the account that the slave thread uses for authentication when
connecting to the master. The account must have the
@code{REPLICATION SLAVE} privilege. (Prior to MySQL 4.0.2, it must have the
@code{FILE} privilege instead.)
The value in the @file{master.info} file takes precedence if it can be read.
If the master user is not set, user @code{test} is assumed.

@item --max-relay-log-size=#
To rotate the relay log automatically.
@xref{Server system variables}.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.14.

@item --read-only
This option causes the slave to allow no updates except from slave threads
or from users with the @code{SUPER} privilege.  This can be useful to ensure
that a slave server accepts no updates from clients.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.14.

@item --relay-log=file_name
The name for the relay log. The default name is
@code{host_name-relay-bin.nnn}, where @code{host_name} is the name of
the slave server host and @code{nnn} indicates that relay logs are
created in numbered sequence.
You can specify the option to create hostname-independent relay log names, or
if your relay logs tend to be big (and you don't want to decrease
@code{max_relay_log_size}) and you need to put them on some area
different from the data directory, or if you want to increase speed by
balancing load between disks.

@item --relay-log-index=file_name
The location and name that should be used for the relay
log index file. The default name is
@code{host_name-relay-bin.index}, where @code{host_name} is the name of
the slave server.

@item --relay-log-info-file=file_name
The name to use for the file in which the slave records
information about the relay logs. The default name is
@file{relay-log.info} in the data directory.

@item --relay-log-purge=@{0|1@}
Disables or enables automatic purging of relay logs as soon as they are not
needed any more.  The default value is 1 (enabled).  This is a global
variable that can be changed dynamically with @code{SET GLOBAL
relay_log_purge}.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

@item --relay-log-space-limit=#
Places an upper limit on the total size of all relay logs on the slave (a
value of 0 means ``unlimited''). This is useful for a slave server host that
has limited disk space.  When the limit is reached, the I/O thread stops
reading binary log events from the master server until the SQL thread has
caught up and deleted some now unused relay logs. Note that this limit is
not absolute: There are cases where the SQL thread needs more events
before it can delete relay logs.
In that case, the I/O thread will exceed the limit until it
becomes possible for the SQL thread to delete some relay logs. Not doing so
would cause a deadlock (which is what happens before MySQL 4.0.13).  You
should not set @code{--relay-log-space-limit} to less than twice the value
of @code{--max-relay-log-size} (or @code{--max-binlog-size} if
@code{--max-relay-log-size} is 0). In that case, there is a chance that the
I/O thread will wait for free space because @code{--relay-log-space-limit}
is exceeded, but the SQL thread will have no relay log to purge and be
unable to satisfy the I/O thread. This forces the I/O thread to temporarily
ignore @code{--relay-log-space-limit}.

@item --replicate-do-db=db_name

Tells the slave to restrict replication to statements where
the default database (that is, the one selected by @code{USE})
is @code{db_name}.
To specify more than one database, use this option multiple
times, once for each database. Note that this will not replicate
cross-database statements such as @code{UPDATE some_db.some_table
SET foo='bar'} while having selected a different database or no database. If you
need cross-database updates to work, make sure that you have MySQL 3.23.28 or
later, and use @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%}.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

An example of what does not work as you might expect: If the slave is
started with @code{--replicate-do-db=sales} and you issue the following
statements on the master, the @code{UPDATE} statement will not be
replicated:

@example
USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
@end example

If you need cross-database updates to work, 
use @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%} instead.

The main reason for this ``just-check-the-default-database''
behavior is that it's difficult from the statement
alone to know whether or not it should be replicated (for example, if you
are using multiple-table @code{DELETE} or multiple-table @code{UPDATE}
statements
that go across multiple databases).  It's also very fast to just check
the default database.

@item --replicate-do-table=db_name.tbl_name

Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the specified table.
To specify more than one table, use this option multiple times, once
for each table.  This will work for cross-database updates, in
contrast to @code{--replicate-do-db}. 
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

@item --replicate-ignore-db=db_name

Tells the slave to not replicate any statement where the default
database (that is, the one selected by @code{USE})
is @code{db_name}. To specify more than one database to
ignore, use this option multiple times, once for each database.
You should not use this option if you are using cross-table updates
and you don't want these updates to be replicated.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

An example of what does not work as you might expect: If the slave is
started with @code{--replicate-ignore-db=sales} and you issue the following
statements on the master, the @code{UPDATE} statement will be replicated:

@example
USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;
@end example

If you need cross-database updates to work, 
use @code{--replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%} instead.

@item --replicate-ignore-table=db_name.tbl_name
Tells the slave thread to not replicate any statement that updates the
specified table (even if any other tables might be updated by the same
statement). To specify more than one table to ignore, use this option
multiple times, once for each table. This will work for cross-database
updates, in contrast to @code{--replicate-ignore-db}.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

@item --replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.tbl_name
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to statements where any of
the updated tables match the specified database and table name patterns.
Patterns can contain the @samp{%} and @samp{_} wildcard characters, which have
the same meaning as for the @code{LIKE} pattern-matching operator.  To specify
more than one table, use this option multiple times, once for each
table.  This will work for cross-database updates.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example: @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%} will replicate only
updates that use a table where the database name starts with @code{foo}
and the table name starts with @code{bar}.

If the table name pattern is @code{%}, it matches any table name and the
option also applies to database-level statements (@code{CREATE DATABASE}, @code{DROP DATABASE}, and
@code{ALTER DATABASE}).
For example, if you use @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.%},
database-level statements statements are replicated
if the database name matches the pattern @code{foo%}.

To include literal wildcard characters in the database or table name
patterns, escape them with a backslash.  For example, to replicate all tables
of a database that is named @code{my_own%db}, but not replicate tables
from the @code{my1ownAABCdb} database, you should escape the @samp{_} and
@samp{%} characters like this: @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=my\_own\%db}.
If you're using the option on the command line, you might need to double
the backslashes or quote the option value, depending on your command
interpreter.  For example, with the @code{bash} shell, you would need to
type @code{--replicate-wild-do-table=my\\_own\\%db}.

@item --replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.tbl_name
Tells the slave thread to not replicate a statement where any table matches the
given wildcard pattern. To specify more than one table to ignore, use
this option multiple times, once for each table. This will work for
cross-database updates.
Please read the notes that follow this option list.

Example: @code{--replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%} will not replicate
updates that use a table where the database name starts with @code{foo}
and the table name starts with @code{bar}.

For information about how matching works, see the description of
the @code{--replicate-wild-ignore-table} option.
The rules for including literal wildcard characters in the option value
are the same as for
@code{--replicate-wild-ignore-table} as well.

@item --replicate-rewrite-db=from_name->to_name

Tells the slave to translate the default database
(that is, the one selected by @code{USE})
to @code{to_name} if it was @code{from_name} on the master.
Only statements involving tables are affected
(not statements such as @code{CREATE DATABASE}, @code{DROP DATABASE},
and @code{ALTER DATABASE}),
and only if @code{from_name} was the default database on the master.
This will not work for cross-database updates.
Note that the database name translation is done before @code{--replicate-*}
rules are tested.

If you use this option on the command line and the @samp{>} character is
special to your command interpreter, quote the option value. For example:

@example
shell> mysqld --replicate-rewrite-db="olddb->newdb"
@end example

@item --replicate-same-server-id

To be used on slave servers. 0 or 1. If set to 1, this slave will
not skip events having its server id. 
Default value is 0 (to break infinite loops in circular replication). 
Can't be set to 1 if @code{--log-slave-updates} is used.
Usually you can use the default setting of 0; the value of 1 is normally useful
only in rare configurations.

@item --report-host=host
The hostname or IP number of the slave to be reported to the master during
slave registration. This value will appear in the output of @code{SHOW SLAVE
HOSTS} on the master server. Leave the value unset if you do not want the
slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is not sufficient for
the master to simply read the IP number of the slave from the TCP/IP socket
after the slave connects. Due to @code{NAT} and other routing issues, that IP
may not be valid for connecting to the slave from the master or other hosts.

@c For
@c the moment, this option is of no real interest; it is meant for failover
@c replication, which is not implemented yet.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.0.

@item --report-port=port_number
The TCP/IP port for connecting to the slave, to be reported to the
master during slave registration.  Set it only if the slave is listening
on a non-default port or if you have a special tunnel from the master or
other clients to the slave. If you are not sure, leave this option unset.
@c For the moment, this option is of no real interest; it is meant for failover
@c replication, which is not implemented yet.

This option is available as of MySQL 4.0.0.

@item --skip-slave-start
Tells the slave server not to start the slave threads when the server starts.
To start the threads later, use a @code{START SLAVE} statement.

@item --slave_compressed_protocol=#
If this option is set to
1, use compression on the slave/client protocol if both the
slave and the master support it.

@item --slave-load-tmpdir=file_name
The name of the directory where the slave creates temporary files.
This option is by default equal to the value of the @code{tmpdir} system variable.
When the slave SQL thread replicates a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement, it
extracts the to-be-loaded file from the relay log into temporary files,
then loads these into the table. If the file loaded on the master was
huge, the temporary files on the slave will be huge, too. Therefore, it might
be advisable to use this option to to tell the slave to put temporary files in
a directory located in some filesystem that has a lot of available space.
In that case, you may also use the @code{--relay-log} option to place
the relay logs in that filesystem, because the relay logs
will be huge as well.
@code{--slave-load-tmpdir} should point to a disk-based filesystem, not a
memory-based one: The slave needs the
temporary files used to replicate @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to survive a
machine's restart.
The directory also should not be one that is cleared by the operating system
during the system startup process.

@item --slave-net-timeout=#
The number of seconds to wait for more data from the master before aborting
the read, considering the connection broken, and trying to reconnect. The first
retry occurs immediately after the timeout. The interval between retries is
controlled by the @code{--master-connect-retry} option.

@item --slave-skip-errors= [err_code1,err_code2,... | all]

Normally, replication stops when an error occurs, which gives you the
opportunity to resolve the inconsistency in the data manually.  This option
tells the slave SQL thread to continue replication when a statement returns
any of the errors listed in the option value.

Do not use this option unless you fully understand why you are getting the
errors.  If there are no bugs in your replication setup and client programs,
and no bugs in MySQL itself, an error that stops replication should never
occur.  Indiscriminate use of this option will result in slaves becoming
hopelessly out of sync with the master, and you will have no idea why.

For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the error message in
your slave error log and in the output of @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}. A full list
of error messages can be found in the source distribution in the
@file{Docs/mysqld_error.txt} file.
The server error codes also are listed at @ref{Error-returns}.

You can (but should not) also use the very non-recommended value of @code{all}
which will ignore all error messages and keep barging along regardless of what
happens.  Needless to say, if you use it, we make no promises regarding your
data integrity. Please do not complain if your data on the slave is not
anywhere close to what it is on the master in this case. You have been
warned.

Examples:

@example
--slave-skip-errors=1062,1053
--slave-skip-errors=all
@end example

@end table

The @code{--replicate-*} rules are evaluated as follows to determine whether a
statement will be executed by the slave or ignored:

@enumerate
@item
Are there some @code{--replicate-do-db} or @code{--replicate-ignore-db}
rules?

@itemize @bullet
@item Yes:

Ignore it and exit.
@item Execute the statement:
Don't execute it immediately, defer the decision, go to the next step.
@end itemize

@item No:

@end itemize

@item
Are there some @code{--replicate-*-table} rules?

@itemize @bullet
@item No:

@item Yes:
Go to the next step. Only tables that are to be updated are compared
to the rules (@code{INSERT INTO sales SELECT * FROM prices}: only
@code{sales} will be compared to the rules). If several tables are to be
updated (multiple-table statement),
the first matching table (matching ``do'' or ``ignore'') wins.
That is, the first table is compared to the rules. Then, if no decision could
be mad, the second table is compared to the rules, and so forth.

@node Replication FAQ, Replication Problems, Replication Options, Replication
@section Replication FAQ

@strong{Q}: How do I configure a slave if the master is already running
and I do not want to stop it?

@strong{A}: There are several options. If you have taken a backup of the
master at some point and recorded the binary log name and offset (from the
output of @code{SHOW MASTER STATUS} ) corresponding to the snapshot, use
the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item
Make sure that the slave is assigned a unique server ID.
@item
Execute the following statement on the slave, filling in appropriate values for each
option:

@example
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     MASTER_HOST='master_host_name',
    ->     MASTER_USER='master_user_name',
    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='master_pass',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='recorded_log_file_name',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=recorded_log_position;
@end example

@item
Execute @code{START SLAVE} on the slave.
@end enumerate

If you do not have a backup of the master server already, here is a quick
procedure for creating one. All steps should be performed on the master host.

@enumerate
@item
Issue this statement:

@example
mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
@end example

@item
With the lock still in place, execute this command (or a variation of it):

@example
shell> tar zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql
@end example

@item
Issue this statement and
make sure to record the output, which you will need later:

@example
mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
@end example

@item
Release the lock:

@example
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

@end enumerate

An alternative is to make an SQL dump of the master instead of a binary copy
as in the preceding procedure. To do this, you can use @code{mysqldump
--master-data} on your master and later load the SQL dump into your slave.
However, this is slower than making a binary copy.

No matter which of the two methods you use, afterward follow the
instructions for the case when you have a snapshot and have recorded the log
name and offset. You can use the same snapshot to set up several slaves.
Once you have the snapshot of the master, you can wait to set up a slave as
long as the binary logs of the master are left intact.  The two practical
limitations on the length of time you can wait are the amount of disk space
available to retain binary logs on the master and the length of time it
will take the slave to catch up.

You can also use @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}.  This is a convenient
statement that transfers a snapshot to the slave and adjusts the log name
and offset all at once. In the future, @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} will be
the recommended way to set up a slave.  Be warned, however, that it works
only for @code{MyISAM} tables and it may hold a read lock for a long time.
It is not yet implemented as efficiently as we would like. If you have large
tables, the preferred method at this time is still to make a binary snapshot
on the master server after executing @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK}.

@strong{Q}: Does the slave need to be connected to the master all the time?

@strong{A}: No, it does not. The slave can go down or stay
disconnected for hours or even days, then reconnect and catch up on the
updates.
For example, you can set up a master/slave relationship over a dial-up link
where the link is up only sporadically and
for short periods of time. The implication of this is that, at any
given time, the slave is not guaranteed to be in sync with the master
unless you take some special measures. In the future, we will have the
option to block the master until at least one slave is in sync.

@strong{Q}: How do I know how late a slave is compared to the
master? In other words, how do I know the date of the last query
replicated by the slave?

@strong{A}: 
If the slave is 4.1.1 or newer, read the @code{Seconds_Behind_Master} column
in @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}. For older versions, the following applies.
This is possible only if @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} on the slave shows that the
SQL thread is running (or for MySQL 3.23, that the slave thread is running),
and that the thread has executed at least one event from the master.
@xref{Replication Implementation Details}.

When the slave SQL thread executes an event read from the master, it
modifies its own time to the event timestamp (this is why @code{TIMESTAMP}
is well replicated). In the @code{Time} column in the output of
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}, the number of seconds displayed for the slave SQL
thread is the number of seconds between the timestamp of the last replicated
event and the real time of the slave machine. You can use this to determine
the date of the last replicated event. Note that if your slave has been
disconnected from the master for one hour, and then reconnects, you may
immediately see @code{Time} values like 3600 for the slave SQL thread in
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}. This would be because the slave is executing
statements that are one hour old.

@strong{Q}: How do I force the master to block updates until the slave catches
up?

@strong{A}: Use the following procedure:

@enumerate

@item
On the master, execute these statements:

@example
mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
@end example

Record the log name and the offset from the output of the @code{SHOW}
statement. These are the replication coordinates.

@item
On the slave, issue the following statement, where the arguments to the
@code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} function are the replication coordinate values
obtained in the previous step:

@example
mysql> SELECT MASTER_POS_WAIT('log_name', log_offset);
@end example

The @code{SELECT} statement will block until the slave reaches the specified
log file and offset. At that point, the slave will be in sync with the master
and the statement will return.

@item
On the master, issue the following statement to allow the master to begin
processing updates again:

@example
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

@end enumerate

@strong{Q}: What issues should I be aware of when setting up two-way
replication?

@strong{A}: MySQL replication currently does not support any
locking protocol between master and slave to guarantee the atomicity of
a distributed (cross-server) update. In other words, it is possible
for client A to make an update to  co-master 1, and in the meantime,
before it propagates to co-master 2, client B could make an update to
co-master 2 that will make the update of client A work differently than
it did on co-master 1. Thus, when the update of client A makes it
to co-master 2, it will produce  tables that are different than
what you have on co-master 1, even after all the updates from co-master
2 have also propagated. This means that you should not co-chain two servers
in a two-way replication relationship unless you are sure that your updates
can safely happen in any order, or unless you take care of mis-ordered
updates somehow in the client code.

You must also realize that two-way replication actually does not improve
performance very much (if at all), as far as updates are concerned. Both
servers need to do the same number of updates each, as you would have
one server do. The only difference is that there will be a little less
lock contention, because the updates originating on another server will
be serialized in one slave thread. Even this benefit might be
offset by network delays.

@cindex performance, improving
@cindex increasing, performance
@strong{Q}: How can I use replication to improve performance of my system?

@strong{A}: You should set up one server as the master and direct all
writes to it. Then configure as many slaves as you have the budget and
rackspace for, and distribute the reads among the master and the slaves.
You can also start the slaves with the @code{--skip-innodb}, @code{--skip-bdb},
@code{--low-priority-updates}, and @code{--delay-key-write=ALL} options
to get speed improvements on the slave end.  In this case, the slave will
use non-transactional @code{MyISAM} tables instead of @code{InnoDB} and
@code{BDB} tables to get more speed.

@strong{Q}: What should I do to prepare client code in my own applications
to use performance-enhancing replication?

@strong{A}:
If the part of your code that is responsible for database access has
been properly abstracted/modularized, converting it to run with a
replicated setup should be very smooth and easy. Just change the
implementation of your database access to send all writes to the master,
and to send reads to either the master or a slave.
If your code does not have this level of abstraction,
setting up a replicated system will give you the opportunity and motivation
to it clean up.
You should start by creating a wrapper library or module with the following
functions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{safe_writer_connect()}
@item
@code{safe_reader_connect()}
@item
@code{safe_reader_statement()}
@item
@code{safe_writer_statement()}
@end itemize

@code{safe_} in each function name means that the function will take care
of handling all the error conditions.
You can use different names for the
functions. The important thing is to have a unified interface for connecting
for reads, connecting for writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

You should then convert your client code to use the wrapper library.
This may be a painful and scary process at first, but it will pay off in
the long run. All applications that use the approach just described will be
able to take advantage of a master/slave configuration, even one involving
multiple slaves.  The
code will be a lot easier to maintain, and adding troubleshooting
options will be trivial. You will just need to modify one or two
functions; for example, to log how long each statement took, or which
statement, among your many thousands, gave you an error.

If you have
written a lot of code already, you may want to automate the conversion
task by using the @code{replace} utility that comes with standard MySQL
distributions, or just write your own conversion script.  Ideally, your
code already uses consistent programming style conventions. If not, then you
are probably better off rewriting it anyway, or at least going through
and manually regularizing it to use a consistent style.

@strong{Q}: When and how much can MySQL replication improve the performance
of my system?

@strong{A}: MySQL replication is most beneficial for a system
with frequent reads and infrequent writes. In theory, by using a
single-master/multiple-slave setup, you can scale the system by adding more
slaves until you either run out of network bandwidth, or your update
load grows to the point that the master cannot handle it.

In order to determine how many slaves you can get before the added benefits
begin to level out, and how much you can improve performance of your site,
you need to know your query patterns, and to determine empirically by
benchmarking the relationship between the throughput for reads (reads per
second, or @code{max_reads}) and for writes (@code{max_writes}) on a typical
master and a typical slave. The example here shows a rather simplified
calculation of what you can get with replication for a hypothetical system.

Let's say that system load consists of 10% writes and 90% reads, and we
have determined by benchmarking that @code{max_reads} is 1200 @minus{}
2 * @code{max_writes}.  In other words, the system can do 1,200 reads per
second with no writes, the average write is twice as slow as the average
read, and the relationship is linear. Let us suppose that the master
and each slave have the same capacity, and that we have one master and N
slaves. Then we have for each server (master or slave):

@code{reads = 1200 - 2 * writes}

@code{reads = 9 * writes / (N + 1) } (reads are split, but writes go
to all servers)

@code{9 * writes / (N + 1) + 2 * writes = 1200}

@code{writes = 1200 / (2 + 9/(N+1)) }

The last equation indicates that the maximum number of writes for N slaves,
given a maximum possible read rate of 1,200 per minute and a ratio of nine
reads per write.

This analysis yields the following conclusions:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If N = 0 (which means we have no replication), our system can handle about
1200/11 = 109 writes per second.

@item
If N = 1, we get up to 184 writes per second.

@item
If N = 8, we get up to 400 writes per second.

@item
If N = 17, we get up to 480 writes per second.

@item
Eventually, as N approaches infinity (and our budget negative infinity),
we can get very close to 600 writes per second, increasing system
throughput about 5.5 times. However, with only eight servers, we increased
it almost four times already.

@end itemize

Note that these computations assume infinite network bandwidth and
neglect several other factors that could turn out to be significant on
your system. In many cases, you may not be able to perform a computation
similar to the just shown that will accurately predict what will happen
on your system if you add N replication slaves. However, answering the
following questions should help you decide whether and how much
replication will improve the performance of your system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
What is the read/write ratio on your system?
@item
How much more write load can one server handle if you reduce the reads?
@item
For how many slaves do you have bandwidth available on your network?
@end itemize

@strong{Q}: How can I use replication to provide redundancy/high
availability?

@strong{A}: With the currently available features, you would have to
set up a master and a slave (or several slaves), and write a script
that will monitor the
master to see whether it is up. Then instruct your applications and
the slaves to change master in case of failure. Some suggestions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To tell a slave to change its master, use the @code{CHANGE MASTER TO}
statement.
@item
A good way to keep your applications informed as to the location of the
master is by having a dynamic DNS entry for the master.
With @code{bind} you can use @file{nsupdate} to dynamically update your DNS.
@item
You should run your slaves with the @code{--log-bin} option and without
@code{--log-slave-updates}. This way the slave will be ready to become a
master as soon as you issue @code{STOP SLAVE}; @code{RESET MASTER}, and
@code{CHANGE MASTER TO} on the other slaves.
For example, assume that you have the following setup:

@example
       WC   
        \  
         v
 WC----> M
       / | \  
      /  |  \     
     v   v   v
    S1   S2  S3  
@end example

M means the master, S the slaves, WC the clients that issue database writes
and reads; clients that issue only database reads are not represented,
because they need not switch.  S1, S2, and S3 are slaves running with
@code{--log-bin} and without @code{--log-slave-updates}.
Because updates received by a slave from the master are not logged in the
binary log unless @code{--log-slave-updates} is specified, the binary log on
each slave is empty.  If for some reason M becomes unavailable, you can
pick one slave to become the new master. For example, if you pick S1,
all WC should be redirected to S1, and S2 and S3 should replicate from S1.

Make sure that all slaves have processed any statements in their relay log.
On each slave, issue @code{STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD}, then check the output
of @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} until you see @code{Has read all relay log}.
When this is true for all slaves, they can be reconfigured to the new setup.
On the slave S1 being promoted to become the master, issue
@code{STOP SLAVE} and  @code{RESET MASTER}.

On the other slaves S2 and S3, use @code{STOP SLAVE} and @code{CHANGE MASTER
TO MASTER_HOST='S1'} (where @code{'S1'} represents the real hostname of
S1). To @code{CHANGE MASTER}, add all information about how to connect to
S1 from S2 or S3 (user, password, port). In @code{CHANGE MASTER}, there is
no need to specify the name of S1's binary log or binary log position to
read from: We know it is the first binary log and position 4, which are
the defaults for @code{CHANGE MASTER}. Finally, use @code{START SLAVE}
on S2 and S3.

Then instruct all WC to direct their statements to S1. From that point on,
all updates statements sent by WC to S1 are written to the binary log of S1,
which will contain exactly every update statement sent to S1 since M died.

The result is this configuration:

@example
       WC   
      /   
      |  
 WC   |  M(unavailable)
  \   | 
   \  | 
    v v
     S1<--S2  S3  
      ^       |
      +-------+
@end example

When M is up again, you just have to issue on it the same @code{CHANGE
MASTER} as the one issued on S2 and S3, so that M becomes a slave of S1 and
picks all the WC writes it has missed while it was down. Now to make M a
master again (because it is the most powerful machine, for example), use
the preceding procedure as if S1 was unavailable and M was to be the new
master. During the procedure, don't forget to run @code{RESET MASTER} on M
before making S1, S2,  and S3 slaves of M. Otherwise, they may pick up old
WC writes from before the point at which M became unavailable.

@end itemize

We are currently working on integrating an automatic master election
system into MySQL, but until it is ready, you will have to
create your own monitoring tools.

@item
Is the slave running? Use @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} to check whether the
@code{Slave_IO_Running} and @code{Slave_SQL_Running} values are both
@code{Yes}.
If not, verify the options that were used when starting the slave server.

@item
If the slave is running, did it establish a connection to the master? Use
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}, find the I/O and SQL threads and check their 
@code{State} column to see how they display.
@xref{Replication Implementation Details}.
If the I/O thread state says @code{Connecting to master}, verify the
privileges for the replication user on the master, master hostname, your
DNS setup, whether the master is actually running, and whether it is reachable
from the slave.

@item
If the slave was running before but now has stopped, the reason usually is
that some statement that succeeded on the master failed on the slave. This
should never happen if you have taken a proper snapshot of the master, and
never modify the data on the slave outside of the slave thread. If it does,
it is a bug or you have encountered one of the known replication limitations
described in @ref{Replication Features}.  If it is a bug, see
@ref{Replication Bugs} for instructions on how to report it.

@item
If a statement that succeeded on the master refuses to run on the slave, and
it is not feasible to do a full database resynchronization (that is, to
delete the slave's database and copy a new snapshot from the master), try
the following:

@enumerate
@item
Determine whether
the slave's table is different from the
master's. Try to understand how this happened.
Then make the slave's table
identical to the master's and run @code{START SLAVE}.

@item
If the preceding step does not work or does not apply, try to understand
whether it would
be safe to make the update manually (if needed) and then ignore the next
statement from the master.

@item
If you decide that you can skip the next statement from the master, issue
the following statements:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = n;
mysql> START SLAVE;
@end example

The value of @code{n} should be 1 if the next statement from the master
does not use @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} or @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}. Otherwise,
the value should be 2.  The reason for using a value of 2 for statements
that use @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} or @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} is that they
take two events in the binary log of the master.

@item
If you are sure that the slave started out perfectly synchronized with the master,
and no one has updated the tables involved outside of slave thread, then
presumably the discrepancy is the result of a bug. If you are running the most
recent version, please report the problem. If you are running an older
version of MySQL, try upgrading.

@section Reporting Replication Bugs

When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and replication
still either does not work at all or is unstable, it is time to send
us a bug report. We need to get as much information as possible from you to be able
to track down the bug. Please do spend some time and effort preparing a good
bug report. 

If you have a repeatable test case that demonstrates the bug, please
enter it into our bugs database
at @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/}. If you have a phantom problem (one that
you cannot duplicate ``at will''), use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item
Verify that no user error is involved. For example, if you update the
slave outside of the slave thread, the data will go out of sync, and you can
have unique key violations on updates. In this case, the slave thread will
stop and wait for you to clean up the tables manually to bring them in sync.
This is not a replication problem. It is a problem of outside interference
that causes replication to fail.

@item
Run the slave with the @code{--log-slave-updates} and @code{--log-bin}
options.
They will cause the slave to log the updates that it receives from the master
into its own binary logs.

@item
Save all evidence before resetting the replication state. If we have no
information or only sketchy information, it becomes difficult or impossible
for us to track down the problem. The evidence you should collect is:

@itemize @bullet
@item
All binary logs from the master

@item
All binary logs from the slave

@item
The output of @code{SHOW MASTER STATUS} from the master at the time
you have discovered the problem

@item
The output of @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} from the master at the time
you have discovered the problem

@item
Error logs from the master and the slave
@end itemize

@item
Use @code{mysqlbinlog} to examine the binary logs. The following should
be helpful
to find the trouble query, for example:
@example
shell> mysqlbinlog -j pos_from_slave_status \
           /path/to/log_from_slave_status | head
@end example
@end enumerate

Once you have collected the evidence for the phantom problem, try hard to
isolate it into a separate test case first. Then enter the problem into
our bugs database at @uref{http://bugs.mysql.com/} with as much
information as possible.

Optimization is a complex task because ultimately it requires
understanding of the whole system. Although it may be possible to perform some
local optimizations with small knowledge of your system or application,
the more optimal you want your system to become, the more you will have
to know about it.

This chapter tries to explain and give some examples of different
ways to optimize MySQL.  Remember, however, that there are
always some (increasingly harder) additional ways to make the system
even faster.


@node Optimise Overview, Query Speed, MySQL Optimisation, MySQL Optimisation
@section Optimization Overview

The most important factor in making a system fast is the basic
design. You also need to know what kinds of things your system will be
doing, and what your bottlenecks are.

The most common bottlenecks are:

@itemize @bullet
@item Disk seeks.
It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data. With modern disks,
the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in
theory do about 100 seeks a second. This time improves slowly with new
disks and is very hard to optimize for a single table. The way to
optimize seek time is to spread the data on more than one disk.

@item Disk reading/writing.
When the disk is at the correct position, we need to read the data. With
modern disks, one disk delivers at least 10-20MB/s throughput. This
is easier to optimize than seeks because you can read in parallel from
multiple disks.

@item CPU cycles.
When we have the data in main memory (or if it was already
there), we need to process it to get to our result. Having small
tables compared to the memory is the most common limiting
factor. But with small tables, speed is usually not the problem.

@item Memory bandwidth.
When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache, the main
memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This is an uncommon bottleneck
for most systems, but one to be aware of.

@subsection MySQL Design Limitations and Tradeoffs

@cindex design, limitations
@cindex limitations, design

When using the @code{MyISAM} storage engine, MySQL uses extremely fast table
locking that allows multiple readers or a single writer. The biggest problem
with this storage engine occurs when you have a mix of a steady stream
of updates and slow selects on the same table.  If this is a problem with
some tables, you can use another table type for these. @xref{Table types}.

MySQL can work with both transactional and non-transactional tables.
To be able to work smoothly with non-transactional tables (which can't
roll back if something goes wrong), MySQL has the following rules:

@cindex default values
@itemize @bullet
@item
All columns have default values.
@item
If you insert a ``wrong'' value in a column, such as a too-large
numerical value into a numerical column, MySQL will set the column to the ``best possible value''
instead of giving an error.
 For numerical values, this is 0, the smallest
possible value or the largest possible value. For strings, this is
either the empty string or the longest possible string that can be in
the column.
@item
All calculated expressions returns a value that can be used instead of
signaling an error condition. For example, 1/0 returns @code{NULL}
@end itemize

The implication of these rules is that you should not use MySQL to check
column content. Instead, you should check values in the application before
storing them in the database.

For more information about this, see @ref{Constraints} and @ref{INSERT}.

@node Portability, Internal use, Design Limitations, Optimise Overview
@subsection Designing Applications for Portability

@cindex portability
@cindex crash-me program
@cindex programs, crash-me

Because all SQL servers implement different parts of SQL, it takes work to
write portable SQL applications.  It is very easy to achieve portability
for very simple selects and inserts, but becomes more difficult the more
capabilities you require.  If you want an application that is fast with
many database systems, it becomes even harder!

To make a complex application portable, you need to choose a number of
SQL servers that it should work with.

You can use the MySQL @code{crash-me} program
to find functions,
types, and limits that you can use with a selection of database
servers. @code{crash-me} tests far from everything possible, but it
is still comprehensive with about 450 things tested.

An example of the type of information @code{crash-me} can provide is that
you shouldn't have column names longer than 18 characters
if you want to be able to use Informix or DB2.

For information, visit
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php}.

Both the MySQL benchmarks and @code{crash-me} programs are very database
independent.  By taking a look at how we have written them, you can get
a feeling for what you have to do to make your own applications database
independent.  The programs can be found in the @file{sql-bench} directory
in the MySQL source distribution. They are written in Perl and use the DBI
database interface.  Use of DBI in itself solves part of the portability
problem because it provides database-independent access methods.

See @uref{http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html} for the results
from the benchmarks.

As you can see in the results, all database systems have some weak points. That
is, they have different design compromises that lead to different
behavior.

If you strive for database independence, you need to get a good feeling
for each SQL server's bottlenecks. MySQL is very fast in
retrieving and updating records, but will have a problem in mixing slow
readers and writers on the same table. Oracle, on the other hand, has a big
problem when you try to access rows that you have recently updated
(until they are flushed to disk). Transactional databases in general are
not very good at generating summary tables from log tables, because in this
case row locking is almost useless.

To make your application @emph{really} database independent, you need to define
an easily extendable interface through which you manipulate your data. As
C++ is available on most systems, it makes sense to use a C++ class-based
interface to the databases.

If you use some feature that is specific to a given database system (such
as the @code{REPLACE} statement, which is specific to MySQL), you should
implement the same feature for other SQL servers by coding an alternative
method. Although the alternative may be slower, it will allow the other
servers to perform the same tasks.

With MySQL, you can use the @code{/*!  */} syntax to add MySQL-specific
keywords to a query.  The code inside @code{/**/} will be treated as a
comment (and ignored) by most other SQL servers.

If high performance is more important than exactness, as in some
Web applications, it is possible to create an application layer that
caches all results to give you even higher performance. By letting
old results ``expire'' after a while, you can keep the cache reasonably
fresh.  This provides a method to handle high load spikes, in which case
you can dynamically increase the cache and set the expiration timeout higher
until things get back to normal.

In this case, the table creation information should contain information
of the initial size of the cache and how often the table should normally
be refreshed.

An alternative to implementing an application cache is to use the MySQL query
cache. By enabling the query cache, the server handles the details of
determining whether a query result can be reused. This simplifies your
application.
@xref{Query Cache}.

@subsection What We Have Used MySQL For

@cindex uses, of MySQL
@cindex customers, of MySQL

During MySQL initial development, the features of MySQL
were made to fit our largest customer. They handle data warehousing for a
couple of the biggest retailers in Sweden.

From all stores, we get weekly summaries of all bonus card transactions,
and we are expected to provide useful information for the store owners
to help them find how their advertisement campaigns are affecting their
own customers.

The volume of data is quite huge (about seven million summary transactions
per month), and we have data for 4-10 years that we need to present to
the users.  We got weekly requests from our customers, who want to get
``instant'' access to new reports from this data.

We solved this by storing all information per month in compressed
'transaction' tables. We have a set of simple macros (script) that
generates summary tables grouped by different criteria (product group,
customer id, store, ...) from the transactional tables.  The reports are
Web pages that are dynamically generated by a small Perl script that
parses a Web page, executes the SQL statements in it, and inserts the
results. We would have used PHP or mod_perl instead, but they were
not available at that time.

For graphical data, we wrote a simple tool in @code{C} that can process SQL
query results and produce GIF images based on those results.  This is also
dynamically executed from the Perl script that parses the Web pages.

In most cases, a new report can be done simply by copying an existing
script and modifying the SQL query in it.  In some cases, we will need to
add more fields to an existing summary table or generate a new one, but
this is also quite simple, because we keep all transactions tables on disk.
(Currently we have at least 50GB of transactions tables and 200GB of other
customer data.)

We also let our customers access the summary tables directly with ODBC
so that the advanced users can experiment with the data themselves.

We haven't had any problems handling this with quite modest Sun Ultra
SPARCstation hardware (2x200MHz). We recently upgraded one of our servers
to a 2 CPU 400MHz UltraSPARC, and we are now planning to start handling
transactions on the product level, which would mean a tenfold increase
of data. We think we can keep up with this by just adding more disk to
our systems.

We are also experimenting with Intel-Linux to be able to get more CPU
power cheaper. Now that we have the binary portable database format (new
in Version 3.23), we will start to use this for some parts of the application.

Our initial feelings are that Linux will perform much better on
low-to-medium load and Solaris will perform better when you start to get a
high load because of extreme disk I/O, but we don't yet have anything
conclusive about this. After some discussion with a Linux kernel
developer, this might be a side effect of Linux allocating so many resources
to the batch job that the interactive performance gets very low. This
makes the machine feel very slow and unresponsive while big batches are
running. Hopefully this will be better handled in future Linux Kernels.


@node MySQL Benchmarks, Custom Benchmarks, Internal use, Optimise Overview
@subsection The MySQL Benchmark Suite

@cindex benchmark suite
@cindex crash-me program

This section should contain a technical description of the MySQL
benchmark suite (and @code{crash-me}), but that description is not
written yet. Currently, you can get a good idea of the benchmarks by
looking at the code and results in the @file{sql-bench} directory in any
MySQL source distribution.

This benchmark suite is meant to tell any user what operations a given
SQL implementation performs well or poorly.

Note that this benchmark is single-threaded, so it measures the minimum
time for the operations performed. We plan to add multi-threaded tests to
the benchmark suite in the future.

The following tables show some comparative benchmark results for several
database servers when accessed through ODBC on a Windows NT 4.0 machine.

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .10 .10
@item @strong{Reading 2000000 rows by index} @tab @strong{Seconds} @tab @strong{Seconds}

@item sybase_odbc       @tab 4802         @tab
@end multitable

For the preceding tests, MySQL was run with an index cache size of 8MB.

We have gathered some more benchmark results at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html}.

Note that Oracle is not included because it asked to be removed. All
Oracle benchmarks have to be passed by Oracle! We believe that makes
Oracle benchmarks @strong{very} biased because the above benchmarks are
supposed to show what a standard installation can do for a single
client.

To use the benchmark suite, the following requirements must be satisfied:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The benchmark suite is provided with MySQL source distributions, so you must
have a source distribution.  You can either download a released distribution
from @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}, or use the current development
source tree (@pxref{Installing source tree}).

@item
The benchmark scripts are written in Perl and use the Perl DBI module to
access database servers, so DBI must be installed.  You will also need
the server-specific DBD drivers for each of the servers you want to test.
For example, to test MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DB2, you must have the
@code{DBD::mysql}, @code{DBD::Pg}, and @code{DBD::DB2} modules installed.
@xref{Perl}.

@end itemize

The benchmark suite is located in the @file{sql-bench} directory of MySQL
source distributions.
To run the benchmark tests, change location into that directory and execute
the @code{run-all-tests} script:

@example
shell> cd sql-bench
shell> perl run-all-tests --server=server_name
@end example

@code{server_name} is one of supported servers. To get a list of
all options and supported servers, invoke @code{perl run-all-tests --help}.

@cindex crash-me
The @code{crash-me} script also is located in the @file{sql-bench} directory.
@code{crash-me} tries to determine what features a database supports and
what its capabilities and limitations are by actually running
queries. For example, it determines:

@itemize @bullet
@item
What column types are supported
@item
How many indexes are supported
@item
What functions are supported
@item
How big a query can be
@item
How big a @code{VARCHAR} column can be
@end itemize

You can find the results from @code{crash-me} for many different database
servers at @uref{http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php}.


@node Custom Benchmarks,  , MySQL Benchmarks, Optimise Overview
@subsection Using Your Own Benchmarks

@cindex benchmarks
@cindex performance, benchmarks

You should definitely benchmark your application and database to find
out where the bottlenecks are.  By fixing a bottleneck (or by replacing it
with a ``dummy module''), you can then easily identify the next
bottleneck.  Even if the overall performance for your
application currently is acceptable, you should at least make a plan for each
bottleneck, and decide how to solve it if someday you really need the
extra performance.

For an example of portable benchmark programs, look at the MySQL
benchmark suite. @xref{MySQL Benchmarks, , MySQL Benchmarks}. You
can take any program from this suite and modify it for your needs. By doing
this, you can try different solutions to your problem and test which is really
fastest for you.

Another free benchmark suite is the @code{Open Source Database Benchmark},
available at @uref{http://osdb.sourceforge.net/}.

It is very common for a problem to occur only when the system is very
heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us when they
have a (tested) system in production and have encountered load problems. In
most cases, performance problems turn out to be due to issues of basic
database design (for example, table scans are @strong{not good} at high load) or
problems with the operating system or libraries. Most of the time, these
problems would be a @strong{lot} easier to fix if the systems were not
already in production.

To avoid problems like this, you should put some effort into benchmarking
your whole application under the worst possible load!  You can use
Super Smack for this. It is available at
@uref{http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/super-smack/}.
As the name suggests, it can bring your system to its knees if you ask it,
so make sure to use it only on your development systems.


@node Query Speed, Locking Issues, Optimise Overview, MySQL Optimisation
@section Optimizing @code{SELECT} Statements and Other Queries

@cindex queries, speed of
@cindex permission checks, effect on speed
@cindex speed, of queries

First, one factor that affects all statements: The more complex your permission
setup is, the more overhead you will have.

Using simpler permissions when you issue @code{GRANT} statements enables
MySQL to reduce permission-checking overhead when clients execute
statements.  For example, if you don't grant any table-level or column-level
privileges, the server need not ever check the contents of the
@code{tables_priv} and @code{columns_priv} tables. Similarly, if you place
no resource limits on any accounts, the server does not have to perform
resource counting.  If you have a very high query volume, it may be worth
the time to use a simplified grant structure to reduce permission-checking
overhead.

If your problem is with some specific MySQL expression or function, you can
use the @code{BENCHMARK()} function from the @code{mysql} client program
to perform a timing test:

@example
mysql> SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1);
+------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1) |
+------------------------+
|                      0 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.32 sec)
@end example

This result was obtained on a Pentium II 400MHz system. It shows that
MySQL can execute 1,000,000 simple addition expressions in 0.32 seconds
on that system.

All MySQL functions should be very optimized, but there may be
some exceptions. @code{BENCHMARK(loop_count,expression)} is a
great tool to find out if this is a problem with your query.

@example
    EXPLAIN tbl_name
or  EXPLAIN SELECT select_options
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic EXPLAIN  SELECT
The @code{EXPLAIN} statement can be used either as a synonym for
@code{DESCRIBE} or as a way to obtain information about how MySQL will execute
a @code{SELECT} statement:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{EXPLAIN tbl_name} syntax is synonymous with @code{DESCRIBE tbl_name}
or
@code{SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name}.
@item
When you precede a @code{SELECT} statement with the keyword @code{EXPLAIN},
MySQL explains how it would process the @code{SELECT}, providing
information about how tables are joined and in which order.
@end itemize
@c end_description_for_help_topic

This section provides information about the second use of @code{EXPLAIN}.

With the help of @code{EXPLAIN}, you can see when you must add indexes
to tables to get a faster @code{SELECT} that uses indexes to find the
records.

You should frequently run @code{ANALYZE TABLE} to update table statistics
such as cardinality of keys, which can affect the choices the optimizer
makes. @xref{ANALYZE TABLE,  , @code{ANALYZE TABLE}}.

You can also see whether the optimizer joins the tables in an optimal
order. To force the optimizer to use a specific join order for a
@code{SELECT} statement, add a @code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} clause.

For single-table joins, @code{EXPLAIN} returns a row of information for each
table used in the @code{SELECT} statement. The tables are listed in the output
in the order that MySQL would read them while processing the query.
MySQL resolves all joins using a single-sweep
multi-join method. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first
table, then finds a matching row in the second table, then in the third table,
and so on. When all tables are processed, it outputs the selected columns and
backtracks through the table list until a table is found for which there are
more matching rows. The next row is read from this table and the process
continues with the next table.

In MySQL version 4.1, the @code{EXPLAIN} output format was changed to work
better with constructs such as @code{UNION} statements, subqueries, and
derived tables. Most notable is the addition of two new columns: @code{id}
and @code{select_type}. You will not see these columns when using servers
older than MySQL 4.1.

Each output row from @code{EXPLAIN} provides information about one table, and
each row consists of the following columns:

@table @code
@item id
@code{SELECT} identifier, the sequential number of this @code{SELECT}
within the query.

@item select_type
The type of @code{SELECT} clause, which can be any of the following:

@table @code
@item SIMPLE
Simple @code{SELECT} (not using @code{UNION} or subqueries)

@item PRIMARY
Outermost @code{SELECT}

@item UNION
Second and further @code{SELECT} statements in a @code{UNION}

@item DEPENDENT UNION
Second and further @code{SELECT} statements in a @code{UNION}, dependent on outer
subquery

@item SUBQUERY
First @code{SELECT} in subquery

@item DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
First @code{SELECT} in subquery, dependent on outer subquery

@item DERIVED
Derived table @code{SELECT} (subquery in @code{FROM} clause)

@item table
The table to which the row of output refers.

@item type
The join type. The different join types are listed here, ordered from the
best type to the worst:

@cindex system table
@cindex tables, system
@table @code
@item system
The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special case of
the @code{const} join type.

@cindex constant table
@cindex tables, constant
@item const
The table has at most one matching row, which will be read at the start
of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the column in
this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the
optimizer. @code{const} tables are very fast because they are read only once!

@code{const} is used when you compare all parts of a
@code{PRIMARY KEY} or @code{UNIQUE} index with constants:

@example
SELECT * FROM const_table WHERE primary_key=1;

SELECT * FROM const_table
WHERE primary_key_part1=1 AND primary_key_part2=2;
@end example

@item eq_ref
One row will be read from this table for each combination of rows from
the previous tables.  Other than the @code{const} types, this is the best
possible join type.  It is used when all parts of an index are used by
the join and the index is a @code{PRIMARY KEY} or @code{UNIQUE} index.

@code{eq_ref} can be used for indexed columns that are compared using the
@code{=} operator.  The compared item may be a constant or an expression
that uses columns from tables that are read before this table.

In the following examples, @code{ref_table} will be able to use @code{eq_ref}:

@example
SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
@end example

@item ref
All rows with matching index values will be read from this table for
each combination of rows from the previous tables.  @code{ref} is used
if the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key or if the key is not
a @code{PRIMARY KEY} or @code{UNIQUE} index (in other words, if the join
cannot select a single row based on the key value).  If the key that is
used matches only a few rows, this is a good join type.

@code{ref} can be used for indexed columns that are compared using the @code{=}
operator.

In the following examples, @code{ref_table} will be able to use @code{ref}:

@example
SELECT * FROM ref_table WHERE key_column=expr;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
WHERE ref_table.key_column=other_table.column;

SELECT * FROM ref_table,other_table
WHERE ref_table.key_column_part1=other_table.column
AND ref_table.key_column_part2=1;
@end example

@item ref_or_null
This join type is
like @code{ref}, but with the addition that MySQL will do an extra search for
rows that contain @code{NULL} values.

In the following example, @code{ref_table} will be able to use
@code{ref_or_null}:

@example
SELECT * FROM ref_table
WHERE key_column=expr OR key_column IS NULL; 
@end example

This join type optimization is new for MySQL 4.1.1 and is mostly used when
resolving subqueries.

@xref{IS NULL optimisation, , @code{IS NULL} optimisation}.

@item index_merge
This join type indicates that the @code{Index Merge}
optimization is used. For more information, see
@ref{OR optimizations}.
In this case, the @code{key} column contains a list of
used indexes, and @code{key_len} contains a list of the longest key parts
for the used indexes.

@item unique_subquery
This type replaces @code{ref} for some @code{IN} subqueries of the following
form:
@example
value IN (SELECT primary_key
              FROM single_table WHERE some_exp) 
@end example
@code{unique_subquery} is just an index lookup function that replaces the
subquery completely for better efficiency.

@item index_subquery
This join type is similar to
@code{unique_subquery}. It replaces @code{IN} subqueries, but
it works for non-unique indexes in subqueries of the following form:

@example
value IN (SELECT key_field
              FROM single_table WHERE some_exp) 
@end example

@item range
Only rows that are in a given range will be retrieved, using an index to
select the rows.  The @code{key} column indicates which index is used.
The @code{key_len} contains the longest key part that was used.
The @code{ref} column will be @code{NULL} for this type.

@code{range} can be used for when an key column is compared to a
constant using any of the @code{=}, @code{<>}, @code{>}, @code{>=}, @code{<},
@code{<=}, @code{IS NULL}, @code{<=>}, @code{BETWEEN}, or @code{IN} operators:

@example
SELECT * FROM range_table
WHERE key_column = 10;

SELECT * FROM range_table
WHERE key_column BETWEEN 10 and 20;

SELECT * FROM range_table
WHERE key_column IN (10,20,30);

SELECT * FROM range_table
WHERE key_part1= 10 and key_part2 IN (10,20,30);
@end example

@item index
This join type is the same as @code{ALL}, except that only the index tree
is scanned.  This is usually faster than @code{ALL}, because the index
file is usually smaller than the data file.

MySQL can use this join type when the query uses only columns that are
part of a single index.

@item ALL
A full table scan will be done for each combination of rows from the
previous tables.  This is normally not good if the table is the first
table not marked @code{const}, and usually @strong{very} bad in all other
cases. Normally, you can avoid @code{ALL} by adding indexes that allow row
retrieval from the table based on constant values or column values from
earlier tables.
@end table

@item possible_keys
The @code{possible_keys} column indicates which indexes MySQL could use to
find the rows in this table. Note that this column is totally independent of
the order of the tables as displayed in the output from @code{EXPLAIN}. That
means that some of the keys in @code{possible_keys} may not be usable in
practice with the generated table order.

If this column is @code{NULL}, there are no relevant indexes. In this case,
you may be able to improve the performance of your query by examining
the @code{WHERE} clause to see whether it refers to some column or columns
that would be suitable for indexing.  If so, create an appropriate index
and check the query with @code{EXPLAIN} again.
@xref{ALTER TABLE,  , @code{ALTER TABLE}}.

To see what indexes a table has, use @code{SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name}.

@item key
The @code{key} column indicates the key (index) that MySQL actually decided
to use. The key is @code{NULL} if no index was chosen. To force MySQL
to use or ignore an index listed in the @code{possible_keys} column, use
@code{FORCE INDEX}, @code{USE INDEX}, or @code{IGNORE INDEX} in your query.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.

Running @code{ANALYZE TABLE} or @code{myisamchk --analyze} on the table
will help the optimizer choose better indexes.
See @ref{ANALYZE TABLE, , @code{ANALYZE TABLE}} and
@ref{myisamchk syntax, , @code{myismchk} syntax}.

@item key_len
The @code{key_len} column indicates the length of the key that
MySQL decided to use.  The length is @code{NULL} if the
@code{key} is @code{NULL}. Note that this tells us how many parts of a
multi-part key MySQL will actually use.

@item ref
The @code{ref} column shows which columns or constants are used with the
@code{key} to select rows from the table.

@c TODO: we don't seem to explain what ref values of "const", NULL, or
@c tbl_name.col_name mean.

@item rows
The @code{rows} column indicates the number of rows MySQL
believes it must examine to execute the query.

@item Extra
This column contains additional information about how MySQL will
resolve the query. Here is an explanation of the different text
strings that can be found in this column:

@table @code
@item Distinct
MySQL will stop searching for more rows for the current row
combination after it has found the first matching row.

@item Not exists
MySQL was able to do a @code{LEFT JOIN} optimization on the
query and will not examine more rows in this table for the previous row
combination after it finds one row that matches the @code{LEFT JOIN} criteria.

Here is an example of the type of query that can be optimized this way:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id
WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
@end example

Assume that @code{t2.id} is defined with @code{NOT NULL}.  In this case,
MySQL will scan @code{t1} and look up the rows in @code{t2} using the values
of @code{t1.id}. If MySQL finds a matching row in @code{t2}, it knows that
@code{t2.id} can never be @code{NULL}, and will not scan through the rest
of the rows in @code{t2} that have the same @code{id} value.  In other
words, for each row in @code{t1}, MySQL needs to do only a single lookup
in @code{t2}, regardless of how many rows actually match in @code{t2}.

@item @code{range checked for each record (index map: #)}
MySQL found no good index to use.  Instead, for each row combination in
the preceding tables, it will do a check to determine which index to use
(if any), and use it to retrieve the rows from the table.  This is not
very fast, but is faster than performing a join with no index at all.

@item Using filesort
MySQL will need to do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve
the rows in sorted order.  The sort is done by going through all rows
according to the @code{join type} and storing the sort key and pointer to
the row for all rows that match the @code{WHERE} clause. The keys then are
sorted and the rows are retrieved in sorted order.

@item Using index
The column information is retrieved from the table using only
information in the index tree without having to do an additional seek to
read the actual row.  This strategy can be used when the query uses only
columns that are part of a single index.

@item Using temporary
To resolve the query, MySQL will need to create a temporary table to hold
the result.  This typically happens if the query contains @code{GROUP BY}
and @code{ORDER BY} clauses that list columns differently.

@item Using where
A @code{WHERE} clause will be used to restrict which rows will be matched
against the next table or sent to the client. Unless you specifically intend
to fetch or examine all rows from the table, you may have something wrong
in your query if you don't have this information and the table join type
is @code{ALL} or @code{index}.
@end table

If you want to make your queries as fast as possible, you should look out for
@code{Using filesort} and @code{Using temporary}.
@end table

You can get a good indication of how good a join is by multiplying all values
in the @code{rows} column of the @code{EXPLAIN} output. This should tell you
roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query. This
number is also used when you restrict queries with the @code{max_join_size}
variable.
@xref{Server parameters}.

The following example shows how a @code{JOIN} can be optimized progressively
using the information provided by @code{EXPLAIN}.

Suppose that you have the @code{SELECT} statement shown here and you plan to
examine it using @code{EXPLAIN}:

@example
EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
            tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
            tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
            tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
            tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
            tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
            et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
        FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
        WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
            AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
@end example

For this example, make the following assumptions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The columns being compared have been declared as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .15 .15
@item @strong{Table} @tab @strong{Column} @tab @strong{Column Type}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{ActualPC}      @tab @code{CHAR(10)}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{AssignedPC}    @tab @code{CHAR(10)}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{ClientID}      @tab @code{CHAR(10)}
@item @code{et}      @tab @code{EMPLOYID}      @tab @code{CHAR(15)}
@item @code{do}      @tab @code{CUSTNMBR}      @tab @code{CHAR(15)}
@end multitable

@item
The tables have the indexes shown here:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .30
@item @strong{Table} @tab @strong{Index}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{ActualPC}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{AssignedPC}
@item @code{tt}      @tab @code{ClientID}
@item @code{et}      @tab @code{EMPLOYID} (primary key)
@item @code{do}      @tab @code{CUSTNMBR} (primary key)
@end multitable

@item
The @code{tt.ActualPC} values aren't evenly distributed.
@end itemize

Initially, before any optimizations have been performed, the @code{EXPLAIN}
statement produces the following information:

@example
table type possible_keys key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
et    ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 74
do    ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 2135
et_1  ALL  PRIMARY       NULL NULL    NULL 74
tt    ALL  AssignedPC,   NULL NULL    NULL 3872
           ClientID,
           ActualPC
      range checked for each record (key map: 35)
@end example

Because @code{type} is @code{ALL} for each table, this output indicates
that MySQL is generating a Cartesian product of all the tables; that is,
every combination of rows.  This will take quite a long time, because the
product of the number of rows in each table must be examined.  For the case
at hand, this product is @code{74 * 2135 * 74 * 3872 = 45,268,558,720} rows.
If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine how long it would take.

One problem here is that MySQL can't (yet) use indexes on columns
efficiently if they are declared differently.  In this context,
@code{VARCHAR} and @code{CHAR} are the same unless they are declared as
different lengths. Because @code{tt.ActualPC} is declared as @code{CHAR(10)}
and @code{et.EMPLOYID} is declared as @code{CHAR(15)}, there is a length
mismatch.

To fix this disparity between column lengths, use @code{ALTER TABLE} to
lengthen @code{ActualPC} from 10 characters to 15 characters:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
@end example

Now @code{tt.ActualPC} and @code{et.EMPLOYID} are both @code{VARCHAR(15)}.
Executing the @code{EXPLAIN} statement again produces this result:

@example
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,   NULL    NULL    NULL        3872    Using
             ClientID,                                         where
             ActualPC
do    ALL    PRIMARY       NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et_1  ALL    PRIMARY       NULL    NULL    NULL        74
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1
@end example

This is not perfect, but is much better: The product of the @code{rows}
values is now less by a factor of 74. This version is executed in a couple
of seconds.

A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length mismatches
for the @code{tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID} and @code{tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR} comparisons:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
    ->                MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);
@end example

Now @code{EXPLAIN} produces the output shown here:

@example
table type   possible_keys key      key_len ref           rows Extra
et    ALL    PRIMARY       NULL     NULL    NULL          74
tt    ref    AssignedPC,   ActualPC 15      et.EMPLOYID   52   Using
             ClientID,                                         where
             ActualPC
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY  15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY  15      tt.ClientID   1
@end example

This is almost as good as it can get.

The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL assumes that values
in the @code{tt.ActualPC} column are evenly distributed, and that isn't the
case for the @code{tt} table.  Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL
about this:

@example
mysql> ANALYZE TABLE tt;
@end example

@c @example
@c shell> myisamchk --analyze PATH_TO_MYSQL_DATABASE/tt
@c shell> mysqladmin refresh
@c @end example

Now the join is perfect, and @code{EXPLAIN} produces this result:

@example
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref           rows Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC    NULL    NULL    NULL          3872 Using
             ClientID,                                        where
             ActualPC
et    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC   1
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID   1
@end example

Note that the @code{rows} column in the output from @code{EXPLAIN} is an
educated guess from the MySQL join optimizer.  You should check whether the
numbers are even close to the truth.  If not, you may get better performance
by using @code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} in your @code{SELECT} statement and trying
to list the tables in a different order in the @code{FROM} clause.


@node Estimating performance, SELECT speed, EXPLAIN, Query Speed
@subsection Estimating Query Performance

@cindex estimating, query performance
@cindex queries, estimating performance
@cindex performance, estimating

In most cases, you can estimate the performance by counting disk seeks.
For small tables, you can usually find a row in one disk seek (because the
index is probably cached).  For bigger tables, you can estimate that
(using B-tree indexes) you will need this many seeks to find a row:
@code{log(row_count) /
log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) +
1}

In MySQL, an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data
pointer is usually 4 bytes. A 500,000-row table with an
index length of 3 bytes (medium integer) gives you:
@code{log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1} = 4 seeks.

This index would require storage of about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2 = 5.2M
(assuming a typical index buffer fill ration of 2/3), so
you will probably have much of the index in memory and you will probably
need only one or two calls to read data to find the row.

For writes, however, you will need four seek requests (as above) to find
where to place the new index and normally two seeks to update the index
and write the row.

Note that the preceding discussion doesn't mean that your application
will slowly degenerate by log N!  As long as everything is cached by the
OS or SQL server, things will go only marginally slower while the table
gets bigger. After the data gets too big to be cached, things will start
to go much slower until your applications is only bound by disk-seeks
(which increase by log N). To avoid this, increase the index cache as the
data grows. @xref{Server parameters}.


@node SELECT speed, Where optimisations, Estimating performance, Query Speed
@subsection Speed of @code{SELECT} Queries

@findex SELECT speed

@cindex speed, of queries

In general, when you want to make a slow @code{SELECT ... WHERE} query
faster, the first thing to check is whether you can add an index.
All references between different tables should usually be done with
indexes. You can use the @code{EXPLAIN} statement to determine which
indexes are used for a @code{SELECT}.
See @ref{MySQL indexes, , MySQL indexes} and
@ref{EXPLAIN, , @code{EXPLAIN}}.

Some general tips for speeding up queries:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To help MySQL optimize queries better, use @code{ANALYZE TABLE} or run @code{myisamchk
--analyze} on a table after it has been loaded with data. This
updates a value for each index part that indicates the average number of
rows that have the same value.  (For unique indexes, this is always 1.)
MySQL will use this to decide which index to
choose when you join two tables based on a non-constant expression.
You can check the result from the table analysis by using @code{SHOW
INDEX FROM tbl_name} and examining the @code{Cardinality} value.
For @code{MyISAM} tables, @code{myisamchk --description --verbose} also
shows index distribution information.

@item
To sort an index and data according to an index, use @code{myisamchk
--sort-index --sort-records=1} (if you want to sort on index 1). This is
a good way to make queries faster if you have a unique index from which
you want to read all records in order according to the index.  Note that
the first time you sort a large table this way, it may take a long time.
@end itemize


@node Where optimisations, OR optimizations, SELECT speed, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{WHERE} Clauses

@findex WHERE

@cindex optimizations

The @code{WHERE} optimizations are put in the @code{SELECT} part here because
they are mostly used with @code{SELECT}, but the same optimizations apply for
@code{WHERE} in @code{DELETE} and @code{UPDATE} statements.

Note that this section is incomplete. MySQL does many
optimizations, and we have not had time to document them all.

Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL are listed here:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Removal of unnecessary parentheses:
@example
   ((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
-> (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
@end example
@item
Constant folding:
@example
   (a<b AND b=c) AND a=5
-> b>5 AND b=c AND a=5
@end example
@item
Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):
@example
   (B>=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
-> B=5 OR B=6
@end example
@item
Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.
@item
@code{COUNT(*)} on a single table without a @code{WHERE} is retrieved
directly from the table information for @code{MyISAM} and @code{HEAP} tables.
This is also done for any @code{NOT NULL} expression when used with only one
table.
@item
Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly
detects that some @code{SELECT} statements are impossible and returns no rows.
@item
@code{HAVING} is merged with @code{WHERE} if you don't use @code{GROUP BY}
or group functions (@code{COUNT()}, @code{MIN()}...).
@item
For each table in a join, a simpler @code{WHERE} is constructed to get a fast
@code{WHERE} evaluation for the table and also to skip records as
soon as possible.
@cindex constant table
@cindex tables, constant
@item
All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the query.
A constant table is any of the following:
@itemize @minus
@item
An empty table or a table with one row.
@item
A table that is used with a @code{WHERE} clause on a @code{PRIMARY KEY}
or a @code{UNIQUE} index, where all index parts are compared to constant
expressions and are defined as @code{NOT NULL}.
@end itemize
All the following tables are used as constant tables:
@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    ->     WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
@end example

@item
The best join combination for joining the tables is found by trying all
possibilities. If all columns in @code{ORDER BY} and in @code{GROUP
BY} come from the same table, then this table is preferred first when
joining.
@item
If there is an @code{ORDER BY} clause and a different @code{GROUP BY}
clause, or if the @code{ORDER BY} or @code{GROUP BY} contains columns
from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary
table is created.
@item
If you use @code{SQL_SMALL_RESULT}, MySQL will use an in-memory
temporary table.
@item
Each table index is queried, and the best index that spans fewer than 30% of
the rows is used. If no such index can be found, a quick table scan is used.
@item
In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even
consulting the data file.  If all columns used from the index are numeric,
only the index tree is used to resolve the query.
@item
Before each record is output, those that do not match the @code{HAVING} clause
are skipped.
@end itemize

Some examples of queries that are very fast:

@example
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
mysql> SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
mysql> SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
    ->     WHERE key_part_1=constant;
mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    ->     ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;
mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    ->     ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... LIMIT 10;
@end example

The following queries are resolved using only the index tree, assuming
that the indexed columns are numeric:

@example
mysql> SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
    ->     WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
mysql> SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
@end example

The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted
order without a separate sorting pass:

@example
mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    ->     ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;
mysql> SELECT ... FROM tbl_name

@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{OR} Clauses

@findex OR
@cindex OR @code{Index Merge} optimization
@cindex optimizations

The @code{Index Merge} method is used to retrieve rows with several
@code{ref}, @code{ref_or_null}, or @code{range} scans and merge the
results into one.
This method is employed when the table condition is a disjunction of
conditions for which @code{ref}, @code{ref_or_null}, or @code{range}
could be used with different keys.

In @code{EXPLAIN} output, this method appears as @code{index_merge} in the
@code{type} column. In this case, the @code{key} column contains a list of
used indexes, and @code{key_len} contains a list of the longest key parts
for the used indexes.

Examples:

@example
SELECT * FROM table WHERE key_col1 = 10 OR key_col2 = 20;

SELECT * FROM table
    WHERE (key_col1 = 10 OR key_col2 = 20) AND nonkey_col=30;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE (t1.key1 IN (1,2) OR t1.key2 LIKE 'value%')
    AND t2.key1=t1.some_col

SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE t1.key1=1
    AND (t2.key1=t1.some_col OR t2.key2=t1.some_col2)
@end example

This ``join'' type optimization is new in MySQL 5.0.0, and represents
a significant change in behavior with regard to indexes, because the
@emph{old} rule was that the server is only ever able to use at most
one index for each referenced table.


@node IS NULL optimisation, DISTINCT optimisation, OR optimizations, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{IS NULL}

@findex IS NULL
@findex ref_or_null

MySQL can do the same optimization on @code{col_name IS NULL} that it can do
with @code{col_name = constant_value}.  For example, MySQL can use
indexes and ranges to search for @code{NULL} with @code{IS NULL}.

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col <=> NULL;

SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    WHERE key_col=const1 OR key_col=const2 OR key_col IS NULL;
@end example

If a @code{WHERE} clause includes a @code{col_name IS NULL} condition for a
column that is declared as @code{NOT NULL}, that expression will be
optimized away.  This optimization does not occur in cases when the column
might produce @code{NULL} anyway; for example, if it comes from a table on
the right side of a @code{LEFT JOIN}.

MySQL 4.1.1 can additionally optimize the combination @code{col_name =
expr AND col_name IS NULL}, a form that is common in resolved subqueries.
@code{EXPLAIN} will show @code{ref_or_null} when this
optimization is used.

This optimization can handle one @code{IS NULL} for any key part.

Some examples of queries that are optimized, assuming that there is an index
on @code{t2 (a,b)}:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=expr OR t1.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE (t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL) AND t2.b=t1.b;

SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE t1.a=t2.a AND (t2.b=t1.b OR t2.b IS NULL);

SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...)
    OR (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...);
@end example

@code{ref_or_null} works by first doing a read on the reference key,
and after that a separate search for rows with a @code{NULL} key value.

Note that the optimization can handle only one @code{IS NULL} level.

@example
SELECT * FROM t1,t2
     WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)
     OR (t1.b=t2.b AND t2.b IS NULL);
@end example

In the preceding case, MySQL will use key lookups only on the part
@code{(t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)} and not be able to use the key part on
@code{b}.

@node DISTINCT optimisation, LEFT JOIN optimisation, IS NULL optimisation, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{DISTINCT}

@findex DISTINCT

@cindex optimizing, DISTINCT

@code{DISTINCT} combined with @code{ORDER BY} will
need a temporary table in many cases.

Note that because @code{DISTINCT} may use @code{GROUP BY}, you should be
aware of how MySQL works with in fields in @code{ORDER BY} or @code{HAVING}
that are not part of the selected fields. @xref{GROUP-BY-hidden-fields}.

When combining @code{LIMIT row_count} with @code{DISTINCT}, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds @code{row_count} unique rows.

If you don't use columns from all tables named in a query, MySQL will stop
scanning the not-used tables as soon as it finds the first match.

@example
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;
@end example

In this case, assuming that @code{t1} is used before @code{t2} (check with
@code{EXPLAIN}), then MySQL will stop reading from @code{t2} (for that
particular row in @code{t1}) when the first row in @code{t2} is found.


@node LEFT JOIN optimisation, ORDER BY optimisation, DISTINCT optimisation, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{LEFT JOIN} and @code{RIGHT JOIN}

@findex LEFT JOIN

@cindex optimizing, LEFT JOIN

@code{A LEFT JOIN B join_condition} in MySQL is implemented as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The table @code{B} is set to be dependent on table @code{A} and all tables
on which @code{A} is dependent.

@item
The table @code{A} is set to be dependent on all tables (except @code{B})
that are used in the @code{LEFT JOIN} condition.

@item
The @code{LEFT JOIN} condition is used to decide how we should retrieve rows
from table B. (In other words, any condition in the @code{WHERE} clause
is not used.)

@item
All standard join optimizations are done, with the exception that a table is
always read after all tables it is dependent on.  If there is a circular
dependence, MySQL issues an error.

@item
All standard @code{WHERE} optimizations are done.

@item
If there is a row in @code{A} that matches the @code{WHERE} clause, but there
is no row in @code{B} that matches the @code{ON} condition,
an extra @code{B} row is generated with all columns set to @code{NULL}.

@item
If you use @code{LEFT JOIN} to find rows that don't exist in some
table and you have the following test: @code{col_name IS NULL} in the
@code{WHERE} part, where @code{col_name} is a column that is declared as
@code{NOT NULL}, then MySQL will stop searching for more rows
(for a particular key combination) after it has found one row that
matches the @code{LEFT JOIN} condition.
@end itemize

@code{RIGHT JOIN} is implemented analogously to @code{LEFT JOIN}.

The join optimizer calculates the order in which tables should be joined.
The table read order forced by @code{LEFT JOIN} and @code{STRAIGHT JOIN}
helps the join optimizer do its work much more quickly, because there are
fewer table permutations to check.

Note that this means that if you do a query of the following type,
MySQL will do a full scan on @code{b} because the @code{LEFT JOIN} will force
it to be read before @code{d}:

@example
SELECT * FROM a,b LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key
@end example

The fix in this case is to change the query to:

@example
SELECT * FROM b,a LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key
@end example

Starting from 4.0.14, MySQL does the following @code{LEFT JOIN} optimization:

If the @code{WHERE} condition is always false for the generated
@code{NULL} row, the @code{LEFT JOIN} is changed to a normal join.

For example, the @code{WHERE} clause would be
false in the following query
if t2.column would be @code{NULL}:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (column) WHERE t2.column2=5;
@end example

Therefore, it's safe to convert the query to a normal join:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE t2.column2=5 AND t1.column=t2.column;
@end example

This can be made faster as MySQL can now use table @code{t2} before
table @code{t1} if this would result in a better query plan.  To force a
specific table order, use @code{STRAIGHT JOIN}.

@node ORDER BY optimisation, LIMIT optimisation, LEFT JOIN optimisation, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{ORDER BY}

In some cases, MySQL can use an index to satisfy an @code{ORDER BY} or
@code{GROUP BY} request without doing any extra sorting.

The index can also be used even if the @code{ORDER BY} doesn't match the
index exactly, as long as all the unused index parts and all the extra
are @code{ORDER BY} columns are constants in the @code{WHERE}
clause. The following queries will use the index to resolve the
@code{ORDER BY} / @code{GROUP BY} part:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,...
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant ORDER BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant GROUP BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
SELECT * FROM t1
    WHERE key_part1=1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
@end example

In some cases, MySQL @emph{cannot} use indexes to resolve the @code{ORDER
BY} (note that MySQL will still use indexes to find the rows that
match the @code{WHERE} clause):

@itemize @bullet
@item
You use @code{ORDER BY} on different keys:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key1,key2;
@end example

@item
You use @code{ORDER BY} on non-consecutive key parts:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key_part2;
@end example

@item
You mix @code{ASC} and @code{DESC}:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 ASC;
@end example

@item
The key used to fetch the rows is not the same as the one used in
the @code{ORDER BY}:

@code{SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1}
@example
@end example

@item
You are joining many tables, and the columns in the @code{ORDER
BY} are not all from the first not-constant table that is used to
retrieve rows. (This is the first table in the @code{EXPLAIN} output that
doesn't have a @code{const} join type.)

@item
You have different @code{ORDER BY} and @code{GROUP BY} expressions.

@item
The type of table index used doesn't store rows in order.  For example, this
is true for a @code{HASH} index in a @code{HEAP} table.

@end itemize

@c NOTE: This description is also present in internals.texi

In those cases where MySQL must sort the result, it uses the following
algorithm:

@enumerate

@item
Read all rows according to key or by table scanning.
Rows that don't match the @code{WHERE} clause are skipped.

@item
Store the sort key values in a buffer. The size of the buffer is the value of
@code{sort_buffer_size}.

@item
When the buffer gets full, run a qsort on it and store the result in a
temporary file.  Save a pointer to the sorted block.  (If all rows fit into
the sort buffer, no temporary file is created.)

@item
Repeat the preceding steps until all rows have been read.

@item
Do a multi-merge of up to @code{MERGEBUFF} (7) regions to one block in
another temporary file.  Repeat until all blocks from the first file
are in the second file.

@item
Repeat the following until there are fewer than @code{MERGEBUFF2} (15)
blocks left.

@item
On the last multi-merge, only the pointer to the row (the last part of
the sort key) is written to a result file.

@item
Read the rows in sorted order by using the row pointers in the result file.
To optimize this, we read in a big block of row pointers, sort them, and use
them to read the rows in sorted order into a row buffer. The size of the
buffer is the value of (@code{read_rnd_buffer_size}.  The code for this
step is in the @file{sql/records.cc} source file.

@end enumerate

With @code{EXPLAIN SELECT ... ORDER BY}, you can check whether MySQL can use
indexes to resolve the query.  It cannot if you see @code{Using filesort} in
the @code{Extra} column.
@xref{EXPLAIN,  , @code{EXPLAIN}}.

If you want to increase @code{ORDER BY} speed, first see whether you can get
MySQL to use indexes instead of using an extra sorting phase. If this is not
possible, you can try the following strategies:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Increase the size of the @code{sort_buffer_size} variable.
@item
Increase the size of the @code{read_rnd_buffer_size} variable.
@item
Change @code{tmpdir} to point to a dedicated disk with lots of empty space.
If you use MySQL 4.1 or later, this option accepts several paths that are
used in round-robin fashion. Paths should be separated by colon characters
(@samp{:}) on Unix and semicolon characters (@samp{;}) on Windows, NetWare,
and OS/2.  You can use this feature to spread load across several
directories.  @strong{Note:} The paths should be for directories in
filesystems that are on different @strong{physical} disks, not different
partitions of the same disk.

@end itemize

By default, MySQL sorts all @code{GROUP BY x,y,...} queries as if you
specified @code{ORDER BY x,y,...} in the query as well. If you include the
@code{ORDER BY} clause explicitly that contains the same column list,  MySQL
optimizes it away without any speed penalty, though the sorting still
occurs.  If a query includes @code{GROUP BY} but you want to avoid the
overhead of sorting the result, you can suppress sorting by specifying
@code{ORDER BY NULL}:

@example
INSERT INTO foo
SELECT a,COUNT(*) FROM bar GROUP BY a ORDER BY NULL;
@end example

@node LIMIT optimisation, Insert speed, ORDER BY optimisation, Query Speed
@subsection How MySQL Optimizes @code{LIMIT}

@findex LIMIT

@cindex optimizing, LIMIT

In some cases, MySQL will handle the query differently when you are
using @code{LIMIT row_count} and not using @code{HAVING}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are selecting only a few rows with @code{LIMIT}, MySQL
uses indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a
full table scan.
@item
If you use @code{LIMIT row_count} with @code{ORDER BY}, MySQL ends the
sorting as soon as it has found the first @code{row_count} lines rather
than sorting the whole table.
@item
When combining @code{LIMIT row_count} with @code{DISTINCT}, MySQL stops
as soon as it finds @code{row_count} unique rows.
@item
In some cases, a @code{GROUP BY} can be resolved by reading the key in order
(or doing a sort on the key) and then calculating summaries until the
key value changes.  In this case, @code{LIMIT row_count} will not calculate any
unnecessary @code{GROUP BY} values.
@item
As soon as MySQL has sent the required number of rows to the client, it
aborts the query unless you are using @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS}.
@item
@code{LIMIT 0} always quickly returns an empty set.  This is useful
to check the query or to get the column types of the result columns.
@item
When the server uses temporary tables to resolve the query, the
@code{LIMIT row_count} is used to calculate how much space is required.
@end itemize


@node Insert speed, Update speed, LIMIT optimisation, Query Speed
@subsection Speed of @code{INSERT} Queries

@findex INSERT

@cindex speed, inserting
@cindex inserting, speed of

The time to insert a record is determined by the following factors,
where the numbers indicate approximate proportions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Connecting:              (3)
@item
Sending query to server: (2)
@item
Parsing query:           (2)
@item

@item
Inserting indexes:       (1 x number of indexes)
@item
Closing:                 (1)
@end itemize

This does not take into consideration the initial overhead to open tables,
which is done once for each concurrently running query.

The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by log N
(assuming B-tree indexes).

You can use the following methods to speed up inserts:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use
@code{INSERT} statements with multiple @code{VALUES} lists to insert several
rows at a time.  This is much faster (many times faster in some cases) than
using separate single-row @code{INSERT} statements.  If you are adding data
to a non-empty table, you may tune up the @code{bulk_insert_buffer_size}
variable to make it even faster.
@xref{Server system variables}.

@item
If you are inserting a lot of rows from different clients, you can get
higher speed by using the @code{INSERT DELAYED} statement. @xref{INSERT,
, @code{INSERT}}.

@item
Note that with @code{MyISAM} tables you can insert rows at the same time
@code{SELECT} statements are running if there are no deleted rows in the
tables.

@item
When loading a table from a text file, use @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}. This
is usually 20 times faster than using a lot of @code{INSERT} statements.
@xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

@item
It is possible, with some extra work, to make @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} run even
faster when the table has many indexes. Use the following procedure:

@enumerate

@item
Optionally create the table with @code{CREATE TABLE}.

@item
Execute a @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement or a @code{mysqladmin flush-tables}
command.

@item
Use @code{myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name}. This will
remove all use of all indexes for the table.

@item
Insert data into the table with @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}. This will not
update any indexes and will therefore be very fast.

@item
If you are going to only read the table in the future, use @code{myisampack}
to make it smaller. @xref{Compressed format}.

@item
Re-create the indexes with @code{myisamchk -r -q
/path/to/db/tbl_name}. This will create the index tree in memory before
writing it to disk, which is much faster because it avoids lots of disk
seeks. The resulting index tree is also perfectly balanced.

@item
Execute a @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement or a @code{mysqladmin flush-tables}
command.

@end enumerate

Note that @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} also performs the preceding optimization
if you insert into an empty table; the main difference is that you can let
@code{myisamchk} allocate much more temporary memory for the index creation
that you might want the server to allocate for index re-creation when it
executes the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement.

As of MySQL 4.0, you can also use
@code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS} instead of
@code{myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name} and
@code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS} instead of
@code{myisamchk -r -q /path/to/db/tbl_name}. This way you can also skip
@code{FLUSH TABLES} steps.

@item
You can speed up multiple-statement @code{INSERT} operations that are done
with multiple statements by locking your tables:

@example
mysql> LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
mysql> INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
mysql> INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

A performance benefit occurs because the index buffer is flushed to disk only
once, after all @code{INSERT} statements have completed. Normally there would
be as many index buffer flushes as there are different @code{INSERT}
statements. Locking is not needed if you can insert all rows with a single
statement.

For transactional tables, you should use @code{BEGIN/COMMIT} instead of
@code{LOCK TABLES} to get a speedup.

Locking also lowers the total time of multiple-connection tests, but the
maximum wait time for individual threads might go up because they wait for
locks.  For example:

@example
Thread 1 does 1000 inserts
Threads 2, 3, and 4 do 1 insert
Thread 5 does 1000 inserts
@end example

If you don't use locking, 2, 3, and 4 will finish before 1 and 5. If you
use locking, 2, 3, and 4 probably will not finish before 1 or 5, but the
total time should be about 40% faster.

@code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, and @code{DELETE} operations are very
fast in MySQL, but you will obtain better overall performance by
adding locks around everything that does more than about five inserts or
updates in a row.  If you do very many inserts in a row, you could do a
@code{LOCK TABLES} followed by an @code{UNLOCK TABLES} once in a while
(about each 1,000 rows) to allow other threads access to the table. This
would still result in a nice performance gain.

@code{INSERT} is still much slower for loading data than @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE}, even when using the strategies just outlined.

@item
To get some more speed for both @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} and
@code{INSERT}, enlarge the key buffer. @xref{Server parameters}.

@end itemize


@node Update speed, Delete speed, Insert speed, Query Speed
@subsection Speed of @code{UPDATE} Queries

Update queries are optimized as a @code{SELECT} query with the additional
overhead of a write. The speed of the write is dependent on the size of
the data that is being updated and the number of indexes that are
updated.  Indexes that are not changed will not be updated.

Also, another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do
many updates in a row later. Doing many updates in a row is much quicker
than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

Note that for a @code{MyISAM} table that uses dynamic record format,
updating a record to a longer total length may split the record.  If you do
this often, it is very important to use @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} occasionally.
@xref{OPTIMIZE TABLE, , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}}.


@node Delete speed, Tips, Update speed, Query Speed
@subsection Speed of @code{DELETE} Queries

The time to delete individual records is exactly proportional to the number
of indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of the
key cache.

If you want to delete all rows in the table, use @code{TRUNCATE TABLE

@node Tips,  , Delete speed, Query Speed
@subsection Other Optimization Tips

@cindex optimization, tips
@cindex tips, optimization

This section lists a number of miscellaneous tips for improving query
processing speed:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Use persistent connections to the database to avoid the connection
overhead. If you can't use persistent connections and you are initiating many
new connections to the database, you may want to change the value
of the @code{thread_cache_size} variable. @xref{Server parameters}.

@item
Always check whether all your queries really use the indexes you have created
in the tables. In MySQL, you can do this with the @code{EXPLAIN}
statement. @xref{EXPLAIN, Explain, Explain, manual}.

@item
Try to avoid complex @code{SELECT} queries on @code{MyISAM} tables that are
updated frequently. This is to avoid problems with table locking that occur
due to contention between readers and writers.

@item
With @code{MyISAM} tables that have no deleted rows, you can insert rows at
the end at the same time another query is reading from the table.  If this
is important for you, you should consider using the table in ways that avoid
deleting rows. Another possibility is to run @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} after you
have deleted a lot of rows.

@item
Use @code{ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY expr1,expr2...} if you mostly
retrieve rows in @code{expr1,expr2...} order.  By using this option after
extensive changes to the table, you may be able to get higher performance.

@item
In some cases, it may make sense to introduce a column that is ``hashed''
based on information from other columns. If this column is short and
reasonably unique, it may be much faster than a big index on many
columns. In MySQL, it's very easy to use this extra column:
@code{SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE hash=MD5(CONCAT(col1,col2))
AND col_1='constant' AND col_2='constant'}

@item
For @code{MyISAM} tables that change a lot, you should try to avoid all
variable-length columns (@code{VARCHAR}, @code{BLOB}, and @code{TEXT}). The
table will use dynamic record format if it includes a single variable-length
column.
@xref{Table types}.

@item
It's not normally useful to split a table into different tables just
because the rows get ``big.'' To access a row, the biggest performance
hit is the disk seek to find the first byte of the row. After finding
the data, most modern disks can read the whole row fast enough for most
applications. The only cases where it really matters to split up a table is if
it's a @code{MyISAM} table with dynamic record format (see above) that you can
change to a fixed record size,
or if you very often need to scan the table and don't need
most of the columns. @xref{Table types}.

@item
If you very often need to calculate results such as counts based on
information from a lot of rows, it's probably much
better to introduce a new table and update the counter in real time. An
update of the following form is very fast:

@example
UPDATE table SET count=count+1 WHERE index_column=constant;
@end example

This is really important when you use MySQL storage engines such as
@code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} that have only table-level locking (multiple
readers / single writers). This will also give better performance with most
databases, because the row locking manager in this case will have less to do.

@item
If you need to collect statistics from large log tables, use summary tables
instead of scanning the whole table. Maintaining the summaries should be
much faster than trying to calculate statistics ``live.'' It's much faster to
regenerate new summary tables from the logs when things change
(depending on business decisions) than to have to change the running
application!

@item
If possible, you should classify reports as ``live'' or ``statistical,''
where data needed for statistical reports is only created from summary
tables that are generated from the actual data.

@item
Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert
values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the
default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL need to do and
improves the insert speed.

@item
In some cases, it's convenient to pack and store data into a @code{BLOB}
column. In this case, you must add some extra code in your application to
pack and unpack information in the @code{BLOB} values, but this may save a
lot of accesses at some stage.  This is practical when you have data that
doesn't conform to a rows-and-columns table structure.

@item
Normally, you should try to keep all data non-redundant (what
is called "third normal form" in database theory). However, do not be
afraid to duplicate information or create summary tables if you need these
to gain more speed.

@item
Stored procedures or UDFs (user-defined functions) may be a good way to get
more performance for some tasks. However, if you use a database system that
does not support these capabilities, you should always have another way to
perform the same tasks, even if the alternative method is slower.

@item
You can always gain something by caching queries or answers in your
application and then performing many inserts or updates together.  If
your database supports table locks (like MySQL and Oracle),
this should help to ensure that the index cache is only flushed once
after all updates.

@item
Use @code{INSERT /*! DELAYED */} when you do not need to know when your
data is written. This speeds things up because many records can be written
with a single disk write.

@item
Use @code{INSERT /*! LOW_PRIORITY */} when you want to give @code{SELECT}
statements higher priority than your inserts.

@item
Use @code{SELECT /*! HIGH_PRIORITY */} to get retrievals that jump the
queue. That is, the @code{SELECT} is done even if there is another client
waiting to do a write.

@item
Use multiple-row @code{INSERT} statements to store many rows with one
SQL statement (many SQL servers support this).

@item
Use @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to load bigger amounts of data. This is
faster than using @code{INSERT} statements.

@item
Use @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns to generate unique values.

@item
Use @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} once in a while to avoid fragmentation when
using a dynamic table format with @code{MyISAM} tables.
@xref{OPTIMIZE TABLE, , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}}.

@item
Use @code{HEAP} tables when possible to get more speed.
@xref{Table types}.

@item
When using a normal Web server setup, images should be stored as
files. That is, store only a file reference in the database.  The main
reason for this is that a normal Web server is much better at caching
files than database contents, so it's much easier to get a fast
system if you are using files.

@item
Use in-memory tables for non-critical data that is accessed often (such as
information about the last displayed banner for users who don't have
cookies enabled in their Web browser).

@item
Columns with identical information in different tables should be
declared to have identical data types. Before Version 3.23, you
got slow joins otherwise.

Try to keep the names simple. For example, in a table named @code{customer},
use a column name of @code{name} instead of @code{customer_name}. To make
your names portable to other SQL servers, you should keep them shorter than
18 characters.

@item
If you need really high speed, you should take a look at the low-level
interfaces for data storage that the different SQL servers support!  For
example, by accessing the MySQL @code{MyISAM} storage engine directly, you could
get a speed increase of two to five times compared to using the SQL interface.
To be able to do this, the data must be on the same server as
the application, and usually it should only be accessed by one process
(because external file locking is really slow).  One could eliminate these
problems by introducing low-level @code{MyISAM} commands in the
MySQL server (this could be one easy way to get more
performance if needed).  By carefully designing the database interface,
it should be quite easy to support this types of optimization.

@item
If you are using numerical data, it's faster in many cases to access
information from a database (using a live connection) than to access a text
file. Information in the database is likely to be stored in a more compact
format than in the text file, so accessing it will involve fewer disk
accesses.  You will also save code in your application because you don't
have to parse your text files to find line and column boundaries.

@item
Replication can provide a performance benefit for some operations. You can
distribute client retrievals among replication servers to split up the load.
To avoid slowing down the master while making backups, you can make backups
using a slave server.
@xref{Replication}.

@item
Declaring a @code{MyISAM} table with the @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1} table
option makes index updates faster because they are not flushed to disk
until the table is closed.  The downside is that if something kills the
server while such tables are open, you should ensure that they are okay by
running @code{myisamchk} before restarting the server.  (However, even in
this case, you should not lose anything by using @code{DELAY_KEY_WRITE},
because the key information can always be generated from the data rows.)

@subsection How MySQL Locks Tables

@cindex internal locking
@cindex locking, tables
@cindex tables, locking

You can find a discussion about different locking methods in the appendix.
@xref{Locking methods}.

Except for @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB} storage engines, all locking in
MySQL is deadlock-free for storage engines that use table-level locking.
This include the @code{MyISAM}, @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}), and @code{ISAM}
engines. Deadlock avoidance is managed by always requesting all needed locks
at once at the beginning of a query and always locking the tables in the
same order.

@code{InnoDB} uses row locks and @code{BDB} uses page locks. For the
@code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB} storage engines, deadlock is possible. This is
because @code{InnoDB} automatically acquires row locks and @code{BDB}
acquires page locks during the processing of SQL statements, not at the
start of the transaction.

The locking method MySQL uses for @code{WRITE} locks works as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If there are no locks on the table, put a write lock on it.

@item
Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.

@end itemize

The locking method MySQL uses for @code{READ} locks works as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.

@item
Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.

@end itemize

When a lock is released, the lock is made available to the threads
in the write lock queue, then to the threads in the read lock queue.

This means that if you have many updates for a table, @code{SELECT}
statements will wait until there are no more updates.

To work around this for the case where you want to do many @code{INSERT} and
@code{SELECT} operations on a table, you can insert rows in a temporary
table and update the real table with the records from the temporary table
once in a while.

This can be done with the following code:
@example
mysql> LOCK TABLES real_table WRITE, insert_table WRITE;
mysql> INSERT INTO real_table SELECT * FROM insert_table;
mysql> TRUNCATE TABLE insert_table;
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

You can use the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} options with @code{INSERT},
@code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE}, or @code{HIGH_PRIORITY} with
@code{SELECT} if you want to prioritize retrieval in some specific
cases.  You can also start @code{mysqld} with @code{--low-priority-updates}
to get the same behavior.

Using @code{SQL_BUFFER_RESULT} can also help to make the duration of table
locks shorter.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.

You could also change the locking code in @file{mysys/thr_lock.c} to use a
single queue.  In this case, write locks and read locks would have the same
priority, which might help some applications.


@node Table locking,  , Internal locking, Locking Issues
@subsection Table Locking Issues

@cindex problems, table locking

The table locking code in MySQL is deadlock free.

To achieve a very high lock speed, MySQL uses table locking (instead of
page, row, or column locking) for all storage engines except @code{InnoDB}
and @code{BDB}.  For large tables, table locking is much better than row
locking for most applications, but there are some pitfalls.

For @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB} tables, MySQL only uses table
locking if you explicitly lock the table with @code{LOCK TABLES}.
For these table types, we recommend you to not use
@code{LOCK TABLES} at all, because @code{InnoDB} uses automatic
row-level locking and @code{BDB} uses page-level locking to
ensure transaction isolation.

As of MySQL Version 3.23.7 (3.23.25 for Windows), you can insert rows into a
@code{MyISAM} table at the same time other threads are reading from it.
Note that currently this works at the time the insert is made only if there
are no holes resulting from rows having been deleted from the middle of the
table.  When all holes have been filled with new data, concurrent inserts
are re-enabled automatically.

Table locking enables many threads to read from a table at the same
time, but if a thread wants to write to a table, it must first get
exclusive access.  During the update, all other threads that want to
access this particular table must wait until the update is done.

Table updates normally are considered to be more important than table
retrievals, so they are given higher priority.  This should ensure that
updates to a table are not ``starved'' even if there is heavy @code{SELECT}
activity for the table.  You can change this behavior by using
@code{LOW_PRIORITY} with update statements or @code{HIGH_PRIORITY} with
@code{SELECT} statements.)

Starting from MySQL Version 3.23.7, you can use the
@code{max_write_lock_count} variable to force MySQL to temporarily elevate
the priority of all @code{SELECT} statements that are waiting for a table,
after a specific number of inserts to the table occur.

Table locking causes problems in cases such as when
a thread is waiting because the disk is full and free space needs to become
available before the thread can proceed. In this case, all
threads that want to access the problem table will also be put in a waiting
state until more disk space is made available.

Table locking is also disadvantageous under the following scenario:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A client issues a @code{SELECT} that takes a long time to run.

@item
Another client then issues an @code{UPDATE} on a used table. This client
will wait until the @code{SELECT} is finished.

@item
Another client issues another @code{SELECT} statement on the same table.
Because
@code{UPDATE} has higher priority than @code{SELECT}, this @code{SELECT}
will wait for the @code{UPDATE} to finish.  It will also wait for the first
@code{SELECT} to finish!
@end itemize

The following list describes some ways to avoid or reduce contention caused by
table locking:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Try to get the @code{SELECT} statements to run faster. You might have to
create some summary tables to do this.

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with @code{--low-priority-updates}.  This will give
all statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than @code{SELECT}
statements. In this case, the second @code{SELECT} statement in the previous
scenario would execute before the @code{INSERT} statement, and would not need
to wait for the first @code{SELECT} to finish.

@item
You can give a specific @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE}
statement lower priority with the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} attribute.

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with a low value for @code{max_write_lock_count} to allow
@code{READ} locks after a certain number of @code{WRITE} locks.

@item
You can specify that all updates issued by a specific thread should be done with
low priority by using the SQL statement: @code{SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1}.
@xref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET}}.

@item
You can specify that a specific @code{SELECT} is very important with the
@code{HIGH_PRIORITY} attribute. @xref{SELECT, , @code{SELECT}}.

@item
If you have problems with @code{INSERT} combined with @code{SELECT}, switch
to using @code{MyISAM} tables, which support concurrent @code{SELECT} and
@code{INSERT} statements.

@item
If you mainly mix @code{INSERT} and @code{SELECT} statements, the
@code{DELAYED} attribute to @code{INSERT} will probably solve your problems.
@xref{INSERT, , @code{INSERT}}.

@item
If you have problems with mixed @code{SELECT} and @code{DELETE} statements,
the @code{LIMIT} option to @code{DELETE} may help.

@node Design, Data size, Optimising Database Structure, Optimising Database Structure
@subsection Design Choices

@cindex design, choices
@cindex database design
@cindex storage of data

MySQL keeps row data and index data in separate files. Many (almost all)
other databases mix row and index data in the same file. We believe that the
MySQL choice is better for a very wide range of modern systems.

Another way to store the row data is to keep the information for each
column in a separate area (examples are SDBM and Focus). This will cause a
performance hit for every query that accesses more than one column. Because
this degenerates so quickly when more than one column is accessed,
we believe that this model is not good for general-purpose databases.

The more common case is that the index and data are stored together
(as in Oracle/Sybase, et al). In this case, you will find the row
information at the leaf page of the index. The good thing with this
layout is that it, in many cases, depending on how well the index is
cached, saves a disk read.  The bad things with this layout are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Table scanning is much slower because you have to read through the indexes
to get at the data.
@item
You can't use only the index table to retrieve data for a query.
@item
You lose a lot of space, because you must duplicate indexes from the nodes
(because you can't store the row in the nodes).
@item
Deletes will degenerate the table over time (because indexes in nodes are
usually not updated on delete).
@item
It's harder to cache only the index data.

@subsection Make Your Data as Small as Possible

@cindex data, size
@cindex reducing, data size
@cindex storage space, minimising
@cindex tables, improving performance
@cindex performance, improving

One of the most basic optimizations is to design your tables to take as
little space on the disk as possible. This can give huge improvements
because disk reads are faster, and smaller tables normally require less main
memory while their contents are being actively processed during query
execution.  Indexing also is a smaller resource burden if done on smaller
columns.

MySQL supports a lot of different table types and row formats.  For each
table, you can decide which storage/index method to use.  Choosing the
right table format for your application may give you a big performance gain.
@xref{Table types}.

You can get better performance on a table and minimize storage space
using the techniques listed here:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use the most efficient (smallest) data types possible. MySQL has
many specialized types that save disk space and memory.

@item
Use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables. For
example, @code{MEDIUMINT} is often better than @code{INT}.

@item
Declare columns to be @code{NOT NULL} if possible. It makes everything
faster and you save one bit per column. If you really need
@code{NULL} in your application, you should definitely use it. Just avoid
having it on all columns by default.

@item
For @code{MyISAM} tables, if you don't have any variable-length columns
(@code{VARCHAR}, @code{TEXT}, or @code{BLOB} columns), a fixed-size record
format is used. This is faster but unfortunately may waste some space.
@xref{MyISAM table formats, , @code{MyISAM} table formats}.

@item
The primary index of a table should be as short as possible. This makes
identification of one row easy and efficient.

@item
Create only the indexes that you really need. Indexes are good for
retrieval but bad when you need to store things fast. If you mostly
access a table by searching on a combination of columns, make an index
on them. The first index part should be the most used column. If you are
@strong{always} using many columns, you should use the column with more
duplicates first to get better compression of the index.

@item
If it's very likely that a column has a unique prefix on the first number of
characters, it's better to index only this prefix. MySQL supports an index
on the leftmost part of a character column. Shorter indexes are faster not
only because they take less disk space, but also because they will give you
more hits in the index cache and thus fewer disk seeks.
@xref{Server parameters}.

@item
In some circumstances, it can be beneficial to split into two a table that is
scanned very often. This is especially true if it is a dynamic
format table and it is possible to use a smaller static format table that
can be used to find the relevant rows when scanning the table.
@end itemize


@node Indexes, Multiple-column indexes, Data size, Optimising Database Structure
@subsection Column Indexes

@cindex indexes, columns
@cindex columns, indexes
@cindex keys

All MySQL column types can be indexed.  Use of indexes on the
relevant columns is the best way to improve the performance of @code{SELECT}
operations.

The maximum number of indexes per table and the maximum index length is
defined per storage engine. @xref{Table types}. All storage engines support at
least 16 indexes per table and a total index length of at least 256 bytes.
Most storage engines have higher limits.

For @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} columns, you can index a prefix of a
column.  This is much faster and requires less disk space than indexing the
whole column.  The syntax to use in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement to
index a column prefix looks like this:

@example
INDEX index_name (col_name(length))
@end example

The example here creates an index for the first 10 characters of the
@code{name} column:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (
    ->        name CHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    ->        INDEX index_name (name(10)));
@end example

@code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns can be indexed as well, but for these
types an index prefix is mandatory, not optional.  The prefix may be up to
255 bytes long.

As of MySQL Version 3.23.23, you can also create @code{FULLTEXT} indexes.
They are used for full-text search. Only the @code{MyISAM} table type
supports @code{FULLTEXT} indexes and only for @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR},
and @code{TEXT} columns.  Indexing always happens over the entire column and
partial (prefix) indexing is not supported. See @ref{Fulltext Search} for
details.

As of MySQL Version 4.1.0, you can create indexes on spatial column types.
Currently, spatial types are supported only by the @code{MyISAM} storage
engine. Spatial indexes use R-trees.

The @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) storage engine supports hash indexes.
As of MySQL Version 4.1.0, the engine also supports B-tree indexes.


@node Multiple-column indexes, MySQL indexes, Indexes, Optimising Database Structure
@subsection Multiple-Column Indexes

@cindex multi-column indexes
@cindex indexes, multi-column
@cindex keys, multi-column

MySQL can create indexes on multiple columns.  An index may consist of up to
15 columns. For certain column types, you can index a prefix of the column
(@pxref{Indexes}).

A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array containing values
that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed columns.

MySQL uses multiple-column indexes in such a way that queries are
fast when you specify a known quantity for the first column of the index in a
@code{WHERE} clause, even if you don't specify values for the other columns.

Suppose that a table has the following specification:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (
    ->       id INT NOT NULL,
    ->       last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    ->       first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    ->       PRIMARY KEY (id),
    ->       INDEX name (last_name,first_name));
@end example

The @code{name} index is an index over @code{last_name} and
@code{first_name}.  The index can be used for queries that specify
values in a known range for @code{last_name}, or for both @code{last_name}
and @code{first_name}.
Therefore, the @code{name} index will be used in the following queries:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name='Widenius';

mysql> SELECT * FROM test
    ->     WHERE last_name='Widenius' AND first_name='Michael';

mysql> SELECT * FROM test
    ->     WHERE last_name='Widenius'
    ->     AND (first_name='Michael' OR first_name='Monty');

mysql> SELECT * FROM test
    ->     WHERE last_name='Widenius'
    ->     AND first_name >='M' AND first_name < 'N';
@end example

However, the @code{name} index will @strong{not} be used in the following
queries:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name='Michael';

mysql> SELECT * FROM test
    ->     WHERE last_name='Widenius' OR first_name='Michael';
@end example

The manner in which MySQL uses indexes to improve query performance is
discussed further in the next section.


@node MySQL indexes, MyISAM key cache, Multiple-column indexes, Optimising Database Structure
@subsection How MySQL Uses Indexes

@cindex indexes, use of

Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values
fast. Without an index, MySQL has to start with the first record
and then read through the whole table to find the relevant
rows. The bigger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index
for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to
seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the
data. If a table has 1,000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than
reading sequentially. Note that if you need to access almost all 1,000
rows, it is faster to read sequentially, because that minimizes disk seeks.

Most MySQL indexes (@code{PRIMARY KEY}, @code{UNIQUE}, @code{INDEX}, and
@code{FULLTEXT}) are stored in B-trees. Exceptions are that indexes on
spatial column types use R-trees, and @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables
support hash indexes.

Strings are automatically prefix-
and end-space compressed. @xref{CREATE INDEX, , @code{CREATE INDEX}}.

In general, indexes are used as described in the following discussion.
Characteristics specific to hash indexes (as used in @code{MEMORY} tables)
are described at the end of this section.

@itemize @bullet

@item
To quickly find the rows that match a @code{WHERE} clause.

@item
To eliminate rows from consideration.  If there is a choice between multiple
indexes, MySQL normally uses the index that finds the smallest number of
rows.

@item
To retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.

@item
To find the @code{MIN()} or @code{MAX()} value for a specific indexed column
@code{key_col}. This is optimized by a preprocessor that checks if you are
using @code{WHERE key_part_# = constant} on all key parts that occur before
@code{key_col} in the index.  In this case, MySQL will do a single key
lookup for each @code{MIN()} or @code{MAX()} expression and replace it
with a constant.  If all expressions are replaced with constants, the
query will return at once:

@example
SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2)
FROM tbl_name where key_part1=10;
@end example

@item
To sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a leftmost
prefix of a usable key (for example, @code{ORDER BY key_part_1,key_part_2
}).  If all key parts are followed by @code{DESC}, the key is read in
reverse order.
@xref{ORDER BY optimisation,  , @code{ORDER BY} optimisation}.

@item
In some cases, a query can be optimized to retrieve values without
consulting the data rows. If a query uses only columns from a table that are
numeric and that form a leftmost prefix for some key, the selected values
may be retrieved from the index tree for greater speed:

@example
SELECT key_part3 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=1
@end example

@end itemize

Suppose that you issue the following @code{SELECT} statement:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
@end example

If a multiple-column index exists on @code{col1} and @code{col2}, the
appropriate rows can be fetched directly. If separate single-column
indexes exist on @code{col1} and @code{col2}, the optimizer tries to
find the most restrictive index by deciding which index will find fewer
rows and using that index to fetch the rows.

@cindex indexes, leftmost prefix of
@cindex leftmost prefix of indexes
If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the
index can be used by the optimizer to find rows. For example, if you
have a three-column index on @code{(col1, col2, col3)}, you have indexed
search capabilities on @code{(col1)}, @code{(col1, col2)}, and
@code{(col1, col2, col3)}.

MySQL can't use a partial index if the columns don't form a
leftmost prefix of the index.  Suppose that you have the @code{SELECT}
statements shown here:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;
@end example

If an index exists on @code{(col1, col2, col3)}, only the first of the preceding
queries uses the index. The second and third queries do involve
indexed columns, but @code{(col2)} and @code{(col2, col3)} are not
leftmost prefixes of @code{(col1, col2, col3)}.

An index is used for columns that you compare with the @code{=}, @code{>},
@code{>=}, @code{<}, @code{<=}, or @code{BETWEEN} operators.

@findex LIKE, and indexes
@findex LIKE, and wildcards
@cindex indexes, and @code{LIKE}
@cindex wildcards, and @code{LIKE}
MySQL also uses indexes for @code{LIKE} comparisons if the argument
to @code{LIKE} is a constant string that doesn't start with a wildcard
character.  For example, the following @code{SELECT} statements use indexes:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE 'Patrick%';
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE 'Pat%_ck%';
@end example

In the first statement, only rows with @code{'Patrick' <= key_col <
'Patricl'} are considered.  In the second statement, only rows with
@code{'Pat' <= key_col < 'Pau'} are considered.

The following @code{SELECT} statements will not use indexes:
@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE '%Patrick%';
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE other_col;
@end example

In the first statement, the @code{LIKE} value begins with a wildcard
character.  In the second statement, the @code{LIKE} value is not a
constant.

MySQL 4.0 and up performs an additional @code{LIKE} optimization.  If you use
@code{... LIKE '%string%'} and @code{string} is longer than three characters,
MySQL will use the @code{Turbo Boyer-Moore} algorithm to initialize the
pattern for the string and then use this pattern to perform the search
quicker.

@findex IS NULL, and indexes
@cindex indexes, and @code{IS NULL}
Searching using @code{col_name IS NULL} will use indexes if @code{col_name}
is indexed.

Any index that doesn't span all @code{AND} levels in the @code{WHERE} clause
is not used to optimize the query. In other words, to be able to use an
index, a prefix of the index must be used in every @code{AND} group.

The following @code{WHERE} clauses use indexes:
@example
... WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
    /* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2
    /* optimized like "index_part1='hello'" */
... WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part_3=5
    /* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index 3 */
... WHERE index1=1 AND index2=2 OR index1=3 AND index3=3;
@end example

These @code{WHERE} clauses do @strong{not} use indexes:

@c NOTE: the comments for the 2nd query below does not seem to make sense.
@c The comment for the 3rd query does not seem correct.

@example
    /* index_part_1 is not used */
... WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2 
    /* Index is not used in both AND parts */
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10                 
    /* No index spans all rows  */
... WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10
@end example

Sometimes MySQL will not use an index, even if one is available.  One way
this occurs is when the optimizer estimates that using the index would
require MySQL to access more than 30% of the rows in the table.  (In this
case, a table scan is probably much faster, because it will require many fewer
seeks.) However, if such a query uses @code{LIMIT} to only retrieve part of
the rows, MySQL will use an index anyway, because it can much more quickly
find the few rows to return in the result.

Hash indexes have somewhat different characteristics than those just
discussed:

@itemize @bullet

@item
They are used only for @code{=} or @code{<=>} comparisons (but are
VERY fast).

@item
The optimizer cannot use a hash index to speed up @code{ORDER BY}
operations. (The index cannot be used to search for the next entry in order.)

@item
MySQL cannot determine approximately how many rows there
are between two values (this is used by the range optimizer to decide which
index to use).  This may affect some queries if you change a @code{MyISAM}

To minimize disk I/O, the @code{MyISAM} storage engine employs a strategy that
is used by many database management systems. It exploits a cache
mechanism to keep the most frequently accessed table blocks in memory:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For index blocks, a special structure called the key cache (key buffer)
is maintained. The structure contains a number of block buffers where the
most-used index blocks are placed.

@item
For data blocks, MySQL uses no special cache. Instead it relies on the
native operating system filesystem cache.

@end itemize

This section first describes the basic operation of the @code{MyISAM} key
cache. Then it discusses changes made in MySQL 4.1 that improve key cache
performance and that enable you to better control cache operation:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Access to the key cache no longer is serialized among threads. Multiple
threads can access the cache concurrently.

@item
You can set up multiple key caches and assign table indexes to specific
caches.

@end itemize

The key cache mechanism also is used for @code{ISAM} tables.  However, the
significance of this fact is on the wane.  @code{ISAM} table use has been
decreasing since MySQL 3.23 when @code{MyISAM} was introduced. MySQL 4.1
carries this trend further; the @code{ISAM} storage engine is disabled by
default.

You can control the size of the key cache by means of the
@code{key_buffer_size} system variable.  If this variable is set equal
to zero, no key cache is used.  The key cache also is not used if the
@code{key_buffer_size} value is too small to allocate the minimal number
of block buffers (8).

When the key cache is not operational, index files are accessed using only
the native filesystem buffering provided by the operating system.  (In other
words, table index blocks are accessed using the same strategy as that
employed for table data blocks.)

An index block is a contiguous unit of access to the @code{MyISAM} index files.
Usually the size of an index block is equal to the size of nodes of the
index B-tree. (Indexes are represented on disk using a B-tree data structure.
Nodes at the bottom of the tree are leaf nodes. Nodes above the leaf nodes
are non-leaf nodes.)

All block buffers in a key cache structure are the same size. This size can
be equal to, greater than, or less than the size of a table index block.
Usually one these two values is a multiple of the other.

When data from any table index block must be accessed, the server first
checks whether it is available in some block buffer of the key cache. If
it is, the server accesses data in the key cache rather than on disk.
That is, it reads from the cache or writes into it rather than reading
from or writing to disk. Otherwise, the server chooses a cache block
buffer containing a different table index block (or blocks) and replaces
the data there by a copy of required table index block.  As soon as the
new index block is in the cache, the index data can be accessed.

If it happens that a block selected for replacement has been modified,
the block is considered ``dirty.'' In this case, before being replaced, its
contents are flushed to the table index from which it came.

Usually the server follows an LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy: When
choosing a block for replacement, it selects the least recently used index
block. To be able to make such a choice easy, the key cache module maintains
a special queue (LRU chain) of all used blocks.  When a block is accessed,
it is placed at the end of the queue.  When blocks need to be replaced,
blocks at the beginning of the queue are the least recently used and become
the first candidates for eviction.


@node Shared key cache, Multiple key caches, MyISAM key cache, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Shared Key Cache Access

Prior to MySQL 4.1, access to the key cache is serialized:
No two threads can access key cache buffers simultaneously.
The server processes a request for an index block only after it has
finished processing the previous request. As a result, a request for an
index block not present in any key cache buffer blocks access by other
threads while a buffer is being updated to contain the requested index block.

Starting from version 4.1.0, the server supports shared access to the key
cache:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A buffer that is not being updated can be accessed by multiple threads.

@item
A buffer that is being updated causes threads that need to use it to wait
until the update is complete.

@item
Multiple threads can initiate requests that result in cache block
replacements, as long as they do not interfere with each other (that is,
as long as they need different index blocks, and thus cause different
cache blocks to be replaced).

@end itemize

Shared access to the key cache allows the server to improve throughput
significantly.


@node Multiple key caches, Midpoint insertion, Shared key cache, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Multiple Key Caches

Shared access to the key cache improves performance but does not eliminate
contention among threads entirely. They still compete for control structures
that manage access to the key cache buffers. To reduce key cache access
contention further, MySQL 4.1.1 offers the feature of multiple key caches.
This allows you to assign different table indexes to different key caches.

When there may be multiple key caches, the server must know which cache to
use when processing queries for a given @code{MyISAM} table. By default, all
@code{MyISAM} table indexes are cached in the default key cache. To assign
table indexes to a specific key cache, use the @code{CACHE INDEX} statement.

For example, the following statement assigns indexes from the tables
@code{t1}, @code{t2}, and @code{t3} to the key cache named @code{hot_cache}:

@example
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op                 | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t3 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
@end example

@strong{Note:} If the server has been built with the @code{ISAM} storage
engine enabled, @code{ISAM} tables use the key cache mechanism. However,
@code{ISAM} indexes use only the default key cache and cannot be reassigned to
a different cache.

The key cache referred to in a @code{CACHE INDEX} statement can be created
by setting its size with a @code{SET GLOBAL} parameter setting statement or by
using server startup options.  For example:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=128*1024;
@end example

To destroy a key cache, set its size to zero:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=0;
@end example

Key cache variables are structured system variables that have a name and
components. For @code{keycache1.key_buffer_size}, @code{keycache1} is the
cache variable name and @code{key_buffer_size} is the cache component.
See @ref{Structured System Variables} for a description of the syntax used
for referring to structured key cache system variables.

By default, table indexes are assigned to the main (default) key cache
created at the server startup. When a key cache is destroyed, all indexes
assigned to it are reassigned to the default key cache.

For a busy server, we recommend a strategy that uses three key caches:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A hot key cache that takes up 20% of the space allocated for all key
caches. This is used for tables that are heavily used for searches but that
are not updated.

@item
A cold key cache that takes up 20% of the space allocated for all key
caches.  This is used for medium-sized intensively modified tables,
such as temporary tables.

@item
A warm key cache that takes up 60% of the key cache space.  This is the
default key cache, to be used by default for all other tables.

@end itemize

One reason the use of three key caches is beneficial is that access to one
key cache structure does not block access to the others.  Queries that
access tables assigned to one cache do not compete with queries that
access tables assigned to another cache.  Performance gains occur for
other reasons as well:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The hot cache is used only for retrieval queries, so its contents are
never modified.  Consequently, whenever an index block needs to be pulled
in from disk, the contents of the cache block chosen for replacement need
not be flushed first.

@item
For an index assigned to the hot cache, if there are no queries
requiring an index scan, there is a high probability that the index
blocks corresponding to non-leaf nodes of the index B-tree will remain
in the cache.

@item
An update operation most frequently executed for temporary tables is
performed much faster when the updated node already is in the cache and need
not be read in from disk first. If the size of the indexes of the temporary
tables are comparable with the size of cold key cache, the probability is
very high that the updated node already will be in the cache.

@end itemize


@node Midpoint insertion, Index preloading, Multiple key caches, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Midpoint Insertion Strategy


By default, the key cache management system of MySQL 4.1 uses the LRU
strategy for choosing key cache blocks to be evicted, but it also supports a
more sophisticated method called the "midpoint insertion strategy."

When using the midpoint insertion strategy, the LRU chain is divided into
two parts: a hot sub-chain and a warm sub-chain. The division point between
two parts is not fixed, but the key cache management system takes care that
the warm part is not ``too short,'' always containing at least
@code{key_cache_division_limit} percent of the key cache blocks.
@code{key_cache_division_limit} is a component of structured key cache
variables, so its value is a parameter that can be set per cache.

When an index block is read from a table into the key cache, it is placed
at the end of the warm sub-chain. After a certain number of hits (accesses
of the block), it is promoted to the hot sub-chain.  At present, the number
of hits required to promote a block (3) is the same for all index blocks.
In the future, we will allow the hit count to depend on the B-tree level
of the node corresponding to an index block: Fewer hits will be required
for promotion of an index block if it contains a non-leaf node from the
upper levels of the index B-tree than if it contains a leaf node.

A block promoted into the hot sub-chain is placed at the end of the chain.
The block then circulates within this sub-chain. If the block stays at the
beginning of the sub-chain for a long enough time, it is demoted to the warm
chain. This time is determined by the value of the
@code{key_cache_age_threshold} component of the key cache.

The threshold value prescribes that, for a key cache containing @code{N}
blocks, the block at the beginning of the hot sub-chain not accessed within
the last @code{N*key_cache_age_threshold/100} hits is to be moved to the
beginning of the warm sub-chain. It then becomes the first candidate for
eviction, because blocks for replacement always are taken from the beginning
of the warm sub-chain.

The midpoint insertion strategy allows you to keep more valued blocks
always in the cache. If you prefer to use the plain LRU strategy, leave the
@code{key_cache_division_limit} value set to its default of 100.

The midpoint insertion strategy helps to improve performance when execution
of a query that requires an index scan effectively pushes out of the cache
all the index blocks corresponding to valuable high-level B-tree nodes. To
avoid this, you must use a midpoint insertion strategy with the
@code{key_cache_division_limit} set to much less than 100.  Then valuable
frequently hit nodes will be preserved in the hot sub-chain during an index
scan operation as well.


@node Index preloading, Key cache block size, Midpoint insertion, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Index Preloading

If there are enough blocks in a key cache to hold blocks of an entire
index, or at least the blocks corresponding to its non-leaf nodes, then
it makes sense to preload the key cache with index blocks before starting
to use it. Preloading allows you to put the table index blocks into a key
cache buffer in the most efficient way: by reading the index blocks from
disk sequentially.

Without preloading, the blocks still will be placed into the key cache as
needed by queries. Although the blocks will stay
in the cache, because there are enough buffers for all of them, they will be
fetched from disk in a random order, not sequentially.

To preload an index into a cache, use the @code{LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE}
statement. For example,
the following statement preloads nodes (index blocks) of indexes of the
tables @code{t1} and @code{t2}:

@example
mysql> LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE t1, t2 IGNORE LEAVES;
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op           | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | preload_keys | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------+----------+----------+
@end example

The @code{IGNORE LEAVES} modifier causes only blocks for the non-leaf
nodes of the index to be preloaded. Thus,
the statement shown preloads all index blocks from @code{t1}, but only
blocks for the non-leaf nodes from @code{t2}.

If an index has been assigned to a key cache using a
@code{CACHE INDEX} statement, preloading places index blocks into that cache.
Otherwise, the index is loaded into the default key cache.


@node Key cache block size, Key cache restructuring, Index preloading, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Key Cache Block Size

MySQL 4.1 introduces a new @code{key_cache_block_size} variable on
a per-key cache basis. This variable specifies the size of the block
buffers for a key cache.  It is intended to allow tuning of the performance
of I/O operations for index files.

The best performance for I/O operations is achieved when the size of
read buffers is equal to the size of the native operating system I/O
buffers. But setting the size of key nodes equal to the size of the I/O buffer
does not always ensure the best overall performance. When reading the
big leaf nodes, the server pulls in a lot of unnecessary data, effectively
preventing reading other leaf nodes.

Currently, you cannot control the size of the index blocks in a table.  This
size is set by the server when the @file{.MYI} index file is created,
depending on the size of the keys in the indexes present in the table
definition.  In most cases, it is set equal to the I/O buffer size. In the
future, this will be changed and then @code{key_cache_block_size} variable
will be fully employed.


@node Key cache restructuring,  , Key cache block size, MyISAM key cache
@subsubsection Restructuring a Key Cache

A key cache can be restructured at any time by updating its parameter
values.  For example:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL cold_cache.key_buffer_size=4*1024*1024;
@end example

If you assign to either the @code{key_buffer_size} or
@code{key_cache_block_size} key cache component a value that differs from
the component's current value, the server destroys the cache's old
structure and creates a new one based on the new values.  If the cache
contains any dirty blocks, the server saves them to disk before destroying
and re-creating the cache. Restructuring does not occur if you set other key
cache parameters.

When restructuring a key cache, the server first flushes the contents of any
dirty buffers to disk. After that, the cache contents become unavailable.
However, restructuring does not block queries that need to use indexes
assigned to the cache.  Instead, the server directly accesses the table
indexes using native filesystem caching.  Filesystem caching is not as
efficient as using a key cache, so although queries will execute, a slowdown
can be anticipated.  Once the cache has been restructured, it becomes
available again for caching indexes assigned to it, and the use of filesystem
caching for the indexes ceases.


@node Open tables, Table cache, MyISAM key cache, Optimising Database Structure
@subsection How MySQL Counts Open Tables

@cindex tables, open
@cindex open tables

When you execute a @code{mysqladmin status} command, you'll see something
like this:

@example
Uptime: 426 Running threads: 1 Questions: 11082
Reloads: 1 Open tables: 12
@end example

The @code{Open tables} value of 12 can be somewhat puzzling if you have
only six tables.

MySQL is multi-threaded, so there may be many clients issuing queries for a
given table simultaneously. To minimize the problem with multiple client threads
having different states on the same file, the table is opened independently
by each concurrent thread. This takes some memory but normally increases
performance.  With @code{MyISAM} tables, one extra file descriptor is
required for the data file for each client that has the table open. (By
contrast, the index file descriptor is shared between all threads.) The
@code{ISAM} storage engine shares this behavior.

You can read more about this topic in the next section. @xref{Table cache}.

@subsection How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables

@findex table_cache

@cindex closing, tables
@cindex table cache

The @code{table_cache}, @code{max_connections}, and @code{max_tmp_tables}
system variables affect the maximum number of files the server keeps open.
If you increase one or more of these values, you may run up against a limit
imposed by your operating system on the per-process number of open file
descriptors.  Many operating systems allow you to increase the open-files
limit, though the method varies widely from system to system.  Consult your
operating system documentation to determine whether it is possible to
increase the limit and how to do so.

@code{table_cache} is related to @code{max_connections}.  For example,
for 200 concurrent running connections, you should have a table cache size of
at least @code{200 * n}, where @code{n} is the maximum number of tables
in a join.  You also need to reserve some extra file descriptors for
temporary tables and files.

Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open file
descriptors implied by the @code{table_cache} setting.  If
@code{table_cache} is set too high, MySQL may run out of file
descriptors and refuse connections, fail to perform queries, and be very
unreliable.  You also have to take into account that the @code{MyISAM} storage
engine needs two file descriptors for each unique open table. You can
increase the number of file descriptors available for MySQL with
the @code{--open-files-limit} startup option to @code{mysqld_safe}.
@xref{Not enough file handles}.

The cache of open tables will be kept at a level of @code{table_cache}
entries. The default value is 64; this can be changed with the
@code{--table_cache} option to @code{mysqld}).  Note that MySQL may
temporarily open even more tables to be able to execute queries.

An unused table is closed and removed from the table cache under the
following circumstances:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When the cache is full and a thread tries to open a table that is not in
the cache.
@item
When the cache contains more than @code{table_cache} entries and
a thread is no longer using a table.
@item
When a table flushing operation occurs. This happens when someone issues a
@code{FLUSH TABLES} statement or executes a @code{mysqladmin flush-tables}
or @code{mysqladmin refresh} command.
@end itemize

When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure
to locate a cache entry to use:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Tables that are not currently in use are released, in least recently used
order.

@item
If a new table needs to be opened, but the cache is full and no tables
can be released, the cache is temporarily extended as necessary.
@end itemize

When the cache is in a temporarily extended state and a table goes from a used
to unused state, the table is closed and released from the cache.

@c TODO: does following paragraph apply to MyISAM/ISAM only? - PD

A table is opened for each concurrent access. This means the table needs
to be opened twice if two threads access the same table or if a thread
accesses the table twice in the same query (for example, by joining the
table to itself).  The first open of any table takes two file descriptors:
one for the data file and one for the index file.  Each additional use of
the table takes only one file descriptor, for the data file.  The index
file descriptor is shared among all threads.

If you are opening a table with the @code{HANDLER tbl_name OPEN}
statement, a dedicated table object is allocated for the thread.
This table object is not shared by other threads and is not closed
until the thread calls @code{HANDLER tbl_name CLOSE} or the thread
terminates.  When this happens, the table is put back in the table cache
(if the cache isn't full).
@xref{HANDLER, , @code{HANDLER}}.

You can determine whether your table cache is too small by checking the
@code{mysqld} status variable @code{Opened_tables}:

@example
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Opened_tables';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| Opened_tables | 2741  |
+---------------+-------+
@end example

If the value is quite big, even when you haven't done a lot of @code{FLUSH
TABLES}, you should increase your table cache size.
See @ref{SHOW STATUS,  , @code{SHOW STATUS}} and
@ref{Server status variables}.

@subsection System/Compile Time and Startup Parameter Tuning

@cindex compiling, optimizing

We start with system-level factors, because some of these decisions must be
made very early to achieve large performance gains. In other cases, a quick
look at this section may suffice. However, it is always nice to have a sense
of how much can be gained by changing things at this level.

The default operating system to use is really important!  To get the best
use of multiple-CPU machines, you should use Solaris (because its threads
implementation works really well) or Linux (because the 2.2 kernel has
really good SMP support).  Also, older Linux kernels have a 2GB filesize
limit by default. If you have such a kernel and a desperate need for files
larger than 2GB, you should get the LFS (large filesystem) patch for the
ext2 filesystem.  Other filesystems such as ReiserFS and XFS do not have
this 2GB limitation.

Because we have not run MySQL in production on that many platforms, we
advise you to test your intended platform before choosing it, if possible.

@cindex locking
Other tips:
@itemize @bullet

@item
If you have enough RAM, you could remove all swap devices. Some
operating systems will use a swap device in some contexts even if you
have free memory.

@item
Use the @code{--skip-external-locking} MySQL option to avoid external
locking.  This option is on by default as of MySQL 4.0.
Before that, it is on by default when compiling with
MIT-pthreads, because @code{flock()} isn't fully supported by
MIT-pthreads on all platforms.  It's also on default for Linux
because Linux file locking is not yet safe.

Note that the @code{--skip-external-locking} option will not affect MySQL's
functionality as long as you run only one server. Just remember to take
down the server (or lock and flush the relevant tables) before you run
@code{myisamchk}. On some systems this option is mandatory, because the
external locking does not work in any case.

The only case when you can't use @code{--skip-external-locking} is if you run
multiple MySQL @emph{servers} (not clients) on the same data,
or if you run @code{myisamchk} to check (not repair) a table without telling
the server to flush and lock the tables first.

You can still use @code{LOCK TABLES}/@code{UNLOCK TABLES} even if you
are using @code{--skip-external-locking}.

MySQL uses algorithms that are very scalable, so you can usually run with
very little memory. However, normally you will get better performance by
giving MySQL more memory.

When tuning a MySQL server, the two most important variables to configure
are @code{key_buffer_size} and @code{table_cache}.  You should first feel
confident that you have these set appropriately before trying to change
any other variables.

The following examples indicate some typical variable values for different
runtime configurations. The examples use the @code{mysqld_safe} script and
use @code{--var_name=value} syntax to set the variable @code{var_name} to the value
@code{value}.  This syntax is available as of MySQL 4.0.  For older versions
of MySQL, take the following differences into account:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use @code{safe_mysqld} rather than @code{mysqld_safe}.

@item
Set variables using @code{--set-variable=var_name=value} or @code{-O
var_name=value} syntax.

@item
For variable names that end in @code{_size}, you may need to specify them
without @code{_size}. For example, the old name for @code{sort_buffer_size} is
@code{sort_buffer}. The old name for @code{read_buffer_size} is
@code{record_buffer}. To see which variables your version of the server
recognizes, use @code{mysqld --help}.

@end itemize


If you have at least 256MB of memory and many tables and want maximum
performance with a moderate number of clients, you should use something
like this:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --key_buffer_size=64M --table_cache=256 \
           --sort_buffer_size=4M --read_buffer_size=1M &
@end example

If you have only 128MB of memory and only a few tables, but you still do a
lot of sorting, you can use something like this:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --key_buffer_size=16M --sort_buffer_size=1M
@end example

If there are very many simultaneous connections, swapping problems
may occur unless @code{mysqld} has been configured to use very
little memory for each connection. @code{mysqld} performs better
if you have enough memory for all connections.

With little memory and lots of connections, use something like this:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --key_buffer_size=512K --sort_buffer_size=100K \
           --read_buffer_size=100K &
@end example

Or even this:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --key_buffer_size=512K --sort_buffer_size=16K \
           --table_cache=32 --read_buffer_size=8K \
           -O net_buffer_length=1K &
@end example

If you are doing @code{GROUP BY} or @code{ORDER BY} operations on tables
that are much larger than your available memory, you should increase the
value of @code{read_rnd_buffer_size} to speed up the reading of rows after
sorting operations.

When you have installed MySQL, the @file{support-files} directory will
contain some different @file{my.cnf} sample files, @file{my-huge.cnf},
@file{my-large.cnf}, @file{my-medium.cnf}, and @file{my-small.cnf}. You can
use these as a basis for optimizing your system.

Note that if you specify an option on the command line for @code{mysqld} or
@code{mysqld_safe}, it remains in effect only for that invocation of the server.
To use the option every time the server runs, put it in an option file.

To see the effects of a parameter change, do something like this (prior to
MySQL 4.1, omit @code{--verbose}):

@example
shell> mysqld --key_buffer_size=32m --verbose --help
@end example

The variable values are listed near the end of the output.
Make sure that the @code{--verbose} and @code{--help} options are
last. Otherwise, the effect of any options listed after them on the command
line will not be reflected in the output.

@subsection How Compiling and Linking Affects the Speed of MySQL

@cindex linking, speed
@cindex compiling, speed
@cindex speed, compiling
@cindex speed, linking

Most of the following tests were performed on Linux with the
MySQL benchmarks, but they should give some indication for
other operating systems and workloads.

You get the fastest executables when you link with @code{-static}.

On Linux, you will get the fastest code when compiling with @code{pgcc}
and @code{-O3}.  You need about 200MB memory to compile @file{sql_yacc.cc}
with these options, because @code{gcc/pgcc} needs a lot of memory to
make all functions inline. You should also set @code{CXX=gcc} when
configuring MySQL to avoid inclusion of the @code{libstdc++}
library (it is not needed). Note that with some versions of @code{pgcc},
the resulting code will run only on true Pentium processors, even if you
use the compiler option indicating that you want the resulting code to work on
all x586-type processors (such as AMD).

By just using a better compiler and better compiler options, you can
get a 10-30% speed increase in your application.  This is particularly
important if you compile the SQL server yourself.

We have tested both the Cygnus CodeFusion and Fujitsu compilers, but
when we tested them, neither was sufficiently bug free to allow
MySQL to be compiled with optimizations on.

The standard MySQL binary distributions are compiled with support for all
character sets.  When you compile MySQL yourself, you should include support
only for the character sets that you are going to use. This is controlled by
the @code{--with-charset} to @code{configure}.

Here is a list of some measurements that we have made:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you use @code{pgcc} and compile everything with @code{-O6}, the
@code{mysqld} server is 1% faster than with @code{gcc} 2.95.2.

@item
If you link dynamically (without @code{-static}), the result is 13%
slower on Linux.  Note that you still can use a dynamically linked
MySQL library for your client applications. It is the server that is most
critical for performance.

@item
If you strip your @code{mysqld} binary with @code{strip mysqld},
the resulting binary can be up to 4% faster.

@item
For a connection from a client to a server running on the same host,
if you connect using TCP/IP rather than a Unix socket file, performance is 7.5%
slower. (If you connect to the hostname @code{localhost},
MySQL uses a socket file by default.)

@item
For TCP/IP connections from a client to a server, connecting to a remote
server on another host will be 8-11% slower than connecting to the local
server on the same host, even for connections over 100Mb Ethernet.

@item
When running our benchmark tests using secure connections (all data
encrypted with internal SSL support) performance was 55% slower than for
unencrypted connections.

@item
If you compile with @code{--with-debug=full}, most queries will be 20% slower.
Some queries may take substantially longer; for example,
the MySQL benchmarks ran 35% slower.  If you use @code{--with-debug} (without
@code{=full}),
the slowdown will be only 15%.  For a version of @code{mysqld} that has
been compiled with @code{--with-debug=full}, you can disable memory
checking at runtime by starting it with the @code{--skip-safemalloc}
option. The execution speed should then be close to when configuring
with @code{--with-debug}.

@item
On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, a server compiled with Forte 5.0 is 4% faster than
one compiled with @code{gcc} 3.2.

@item
On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, a server compiled with Forte 5.0 is 4% faster in
32-bit mode than in 64-bit mode.

@item
Compiling with @code{gcc} 2.95.2 for UltraSPARC with the option
@code{-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa} gives 4% more performance.

@item
On Solaris 2.5.1, MIT-pthreads is 8-12% slower than Solaris native
threads on a single processor. With more load or CPUs, the difference should
be larger.

@item
Compiling on Linux-x86 using @code{gcc} without frame pointers
@code{-fomit-frame-pointer} or @code{-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp}
makes @code{mysqld} 1-4% faster.
@end itemize

Binary MySQL distributions for Linux that are provided by MySQL AB used
to be compiled with @code{pgcc}. We had to go back to regular @code{gcc}
due to a bug in @code{pgcc} that would generate code that does
not run on AMD. We will continue using @code{gcc} until that bug is resolved.
In the meantime, if you have a non-AMD machine, you can get a faster
binary by compiling with @code{pgcc}.  The standard MySQL
Linux binary is linked statically to make it faster and more portable.


@node Memory use, DNS, Compile and link options, Optimising the Server
@subsection How MySQL Uses Memory

@cindex memory use

The following list indicates some of the ways that the @code{mysqld} server
uses memory.  Where applicable, the name of the system variable relevant
to the memory use is given:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The key buffer (variable @code{key_buffer_size}) is shared by all
threads; other buffers used by the server are allocated as
needed. @xref{Server parameters}.

@item
Each connection uses some thread-specific space: a stack (default 64KB,
variable @code{thread_stack}), a connection buffer (variable
@code{net_buffer_length}), and a result buffer (variable
@code{net_buffer_length}). The connection buffer and result buffer are
dynamically enlarged up to @code{max_allowed_packet} when needed.  While
a query is running, a copy of the current query string is also allocated.

@item
All threads share the same base memory.

@item
Only compressed @code{ISAM} and @code{MyISAM} tables are memory mapped.  This
is because the 32-bit memory space of 4GB is not large enough for most
big tables. When systems with a 64-bit address space become more
common, we may add general support for memory mapping.

@item
Each request that performs a sequential scan of a table allocates a read buffer
(variable @code{read_buffer_size}).

@item
When reading rows in ``random'' order (for example, after a sort), a
random-read buffer is allocated to avoid disk seeks.
(variable @code{read_rnd_buffer_size}).

@item
All joins are done in one pass, and most joins can be done without even
using a temporary table. Most temporary tables are memory-based (@code{HEAP})
tables.  Temporary tables with a large record length (calculated as the
sum of all column lengths) or that contain @code{BLOB} columns are
stored on disk.

One problem in MySQL before Version 3.23.2 is that if an internal in-memory
heap table exceeds the size of @code{tmp_table_size}, the error @code{The
table tbl_name is full} occurs. From 3.23.2 on, this is handled
automatically by changing the in-memory heap table to a disk-based
@code{MyISAM} table as necessary. To work around this problem for older
servers, you can increase the temporary table size by setting the
@code{tmp_table_size} option to @code{mysqld}, or by setting the SQL option
@code{SQL_BIG_TABLES} in the client program.
@xref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET} Syntax}.

In MySQL Version 3.20, the maximum size of the temporary table is
@code{record_buffer*16}; if you are using this version, you have to increase
the value of @code{record_buffer}. You can also start @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--big-tables} option to always store temporary tables on disk.
However, this will affect the speed of many complicated queries.

@item
Most requests that perform a sort allocate a sort buffer and zero to two temporary
files depending on the result set size. @xref{Temporary files}.

@item
Almost all parsing and calculating is done in a local memory store. No
memory overhead is needed for small items, so the normal slow memory
allocation and freeing is avoided. Memory is allocated only for
unexpectedly large strings; this is done with @code{malloc()} and
@code{free()}.

@item
For each @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} table that is opened, the index file
is opened once and the data file is opened once for each concurrently running
thread. For each concurrent thread, a table structure, column structures for
each column, and a buffer of size @code{3 * n} are allocated (where @code{n}
is the maximum row length, not counting @code{BLOB} columns). A @code{BLOB}
column requires five to eight bytes plus the length of the @code{BLOB} data.
The @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} storage engines maintain one extra row
buffer for internal use.

@item
For each table having @code{BLOB} columns, a buffer is enlarged dynamically
to read in larger @code{BLOB} values. If you scan a table, a buffer as large
as the largest @code{BLOB} value is allocated.

@item
Handler structures for all in-use tables are saved in a cache and managed as a
FIFO. Normally the cache has 64 entries. If a table has been used by two
running threads at the same time, the cache contains two entries for the
table. @xref{Table cache}.

@item
A @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement or  @code{mysqladmin flush-tables} command
closes all tables that are not in use and marks all in-use tables to be
closed when the currently executing thread finishes. This effectively frees
most in-use memory.

@end itemize

@code{ps} and other system status programs may report that @code{mysqld}
uses a lot of memory. This may be caused by thread stacks on different
memory addresses. For example, the Solaris version of @code{ps} counts
the unused memory between stacks as used memory. You can verify this by
checking available swap with @code{swap -s}. We have tested
@code{mysqld} with commercial memory-leakage detectors, so there should
be no memory leaks.


@node DNS,  , Memory use, Optimising the Server
@subsection How MySQL Uses DNS

@cindex DNS
@cindex hostname caching

When a new client connects to @code{mysqld}, @code{mysqld} spawns a
new thread to handle the request.  This thread first checks if the
hostname is in the hostname cache. If not, the thread attempts to resolve the
hostname:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the operating system supports the thread-safe @code{gethostbyaddr_r()} and
@code{gethostbyname_r()} calls, the thread uses them to perform hostname
resolution.

@item
If the operating system doesn't support the thread-safe calls, the
thread locks a mutex and calls @code{gethostbyaddr()} and
@code{gethostbyname()} instead. In this case, no other thread
can resolve hostnames that are not in the hostname cache until the
first thread unlocks the mutex.

@end itemize

You can disable DNS hostname lookups by starting @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--skip-name-resolve} option.  However, in this case, you can use only IP
numbers in the MySQL grant tables.

If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you can get more performance by
either disabling DNS lookups with @code{--skip-name-resolve} or by
increasing the @code{HOST_CACHE_SIZE} define (default value: 128) and
recompiling @code{mysqld}.

You can disable the hostname cache by starting the server with the
@code{--skip-host-cache} option. To clear the hostname cache, issue a
@code{FLUSH HOSTS} statement or execute the @code{mysqladmin flush-hosts}
command.

If you want to disallow TCP/IP connections entirely, start @code{mysqld} with
the @code{--skip-networking} option.


@node Disk issues,  , Optimising the Server, MySQL Optimisation
@section Disk Issues

@cindex disk issues
@cindex performance, disk issues

@itemize @bullet
@item
Disk seeks are a big performance bottleneck. This problem becomes more
and more apparent when the amount of data starts to grow so
large that effective caching becomes impossible. For large databases,
where you access data more or less randomly, you can be sure that you
will need at least one disk seek to read and a couple of disk seeks to
write things. To minimize this problem, use disks with low seek times.

@item
Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce
the seek overhead) by either symlinking files to different disks or striping
the disks.

@table @strong
@item Using symbolic links
This means that, for @code{MyISAM} tables, you symlink the index file and/or
data file from their usual location in the data directory to another disk
(that may also be striped). This makes both the seek and read times better,
assuming that the disk is not used for other purposes as well. @xref{Symbolic
links}.

@cindex striping, defined
@item Striping
Striping means that you have many disks and put the first block on the
first disk, the second block on the second disk, and the Nth block on the
(N mod number_of_disks) disk, and so on. This means if your normal data
size is less than the stripe size (or perfectly aligned), you will get
much better performance. Striping is very dependent on the operating system
and the stripe size, so benchmark your application with different
stripe sizes. @xref{Custom Benchmarks}.

Note that the speed difference for striping is @strong{very} dependent on
the parameters. Depending on how you set the striping parameters and number
of disks, you may get differences measured in orders of magnitude. Note
that you have to choose to optimize for random or sequential access.

@end table

@item
For reliability you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping plus mirroring), but
in this case, you will need 2*N drives to hold N drives of data. This is
probably the best option if you have the money for it!  However, you may
also have to invest in some volume-management software to handle it
efficiently.

@item
A good option is to vary the RAID level according to how critical a type of
data is. For example, store semi-important data that can be regenerated
on a RAID 0 disk, but store really important data such as host information
and logs on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk. RAID N can be a problem if you
have many writes, due to the time required to update the parity bits.

@item
On Linux, you can get much more performance by using @code{hdparm} to
configure your disk's interface.  (Up to 100% under load is not uncommon.)
The following @code{hdparm} options should be quite good for MySQL, and
probably for many other applications:

@example
hdparm -m 16 -d 1
@end example

Note that performance and reliability when using this command depends
on your hardware, so we strongly suggest that you test your system
thoroughly after using @code{hdparm}.  Please consult the @code{hdparm}
manual page for more information.  If @code{hdparm} is not used wisely,
filesystem corruption may result, so back up everything before
experimenting!

@item
You can also set the parameters for the filesystem that the database uses:

If you don't need to know when files were last accessed (which is
not really useful on a database server), you can mount your
filesystems with the @code{-o noatime} option.  That skips updates
to the last access time in inodes on the filesystem, which avoids
some disk seeks.

On many operating systems, you can set a filesystem to be updated
asynchronously by mounting it with the @code{-o async} option.  If your
computer is reasonably stable, this should give you more performance without
sacrificing too much reliability.  (This flag is on by default on Linux.)

You can move tables and databases from the database directory to other
locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations.
You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file
system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by
spreading your tables to different disk.

The recommended way to do this is to just symlink databases to a
different disk. Symlink tables only as a last resort.

@subsubsection Using Symbolic Links for Databases on Unix

@cindex databases, symbolic links

On Unix, the way to symlink a database is to first create a directory on some
disk where you have free space and then create a symlink to it from
the MySQL data directory.

@example
shell> mkdir /dr1/databases/test
shell> ln -s /dr1/databases/test /path/to/datadir
@end example

MySQL doesn't support linking one directory to multiple
databases.  Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link will
work fine as long as you don't make a symbolic link between databases.
Suppose that you have a database @code{db1} under the MySQL data
directory, and then make a symlink @code{db2} that points to @code{db1}:

@example
shell> cd /path/to/datadir
shell> ln -s db1 db2
@end example

Now, for any table @code{tbl_a} in @code{db1}, there also appears to be
a table @code{tbl_a} in @code{db2}.  If one thread updates @code{db1.tbl_a}
and another thread updates @code{db2.tbl_a}, there will be problems.

If you really need to do this, you must change the following code in
@file{mysys/mf_format.c}:

@example
if (flag & 32 || (!lstat(to,&stat_buff) && S_ISLNK(stat_buff.st_mode)))
@end example

to

@example
if (1)
@end example

On Windows, you can use internal symbolic links to directories by compiling
MySQL with @code{-DUSE_SYMDIR}. This allows you to put different
databases on different disks. @xref{Windows symbolic links}.


@node Symbolic links to tables, Windows symbolic links, Symbolic links to databases, Symbolic links
@subsubsection Using Symbolic Links for Tables on Unix

@cindex tables, symbolic links

Before MySQL 4.0, you should not symlink tables unless you are
@strong{very} careful with them. The problem is that if you run @code{ALTER
TABLE}, @code{REPAIR TABLE}, or @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} on a symlinked
table, the symlinks will be removed and replaced by the original
files. This happens because these statements work by creating a
temporary file in the database directory and replacing the original
file with the temporary file when the statement operation is complete.

You should not symlink tables on systems that don't have a fully
working @code{realpath()} call. (At least Linux and Solaris support
@code{realpath()}). You can check whether your system supports symbolic links
by doing @code{SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_symlink'}.

In MySQL 4.0, symlinks are fully supported only for @code{MyISAM}
tables.  For other table types, you will probably get strange problems
if you try to use symbolic links on files in the operating system with
any of the preceding statements.

The handling of symbolic links for @code{MyISAM} tables in MySQL 4.0 works
the following way:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In the data directory, you will always have the table definition
file, the data file, and the index file. The data file and index file
can be moved elsewhere and replaced in the data directory by
symlinks. The definition file cannot.

@item
You can symlink the data file and the index file independently to different
directories.

@item
The symlinking can be done manually from the command line with @code{ln -s}
if @code{mysqld} is not running. With SQL, you can instruct the server to
perform the symlinking by using the @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX
DIRECTORY} options to @code{CREATE TABLE}.
@xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

@item
@code{myisamchk} will not replace a symlink with the data file or index file.
It works directly on the file a symlink points to. Any temporary files
are created in the directory where the data file or index file is
located.

@item
When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and the
file the symlink points to are dropped.  This is a good reason why you
should @strong{not} run @code{mysqld} as @code{root} or allow
users to have write access to the MySQL database directories.

@item
@c TODO: is this also true for RENAME table?
If you rename a table with @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME} and you don't move
the table to another database, the symlinks in the database directory
are renamed to the new names and the data file and index file are
renamed accordingly.

@item
@c TODO: is this also true for RENAME table?
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME} to move a table to another database,
the table is moved to the other database directory and the old
symlinks and the files to which they pointed are deleted.  (In other words,
the new table will not be symlinked.)

@item
If you are not using symlinks, you should use the @code{--skip-symlink}
option to @code{mysqld} to ensure that no one can use @code{mysqld} to drop
or rename a file outside of the data directory.
@end itemize

@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} doesn't report if the table has symbolic links
prior to MySQL 4.0.15. This is also true for @code{mysqldump}, which uses
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} to generate @code{CREATE TABLE} statements.

Table symlink operations that are not yet supported:

@cindex TODO, symlinks
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} ignores the @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX
DIRECTORY} table options.
@item
@code{BACKUP TABLE} and @code{RESTORE TABLE} don't respect symbolic
links.
@item
The @file{.frm} file must @strong{never} be a symbolic link (as said
previously, only the data and index files can be symbolic links).  Attempting
to do this (for example, to make synonyms) will produce incorrect results.
Suppose that you have a database @code{db1} under the MySQL data directory,
a table @code{tbl1} in this database, and in the @code{db1} directory you
make a symlink @code{tbl2} that points to @code{tbl1}:

@example
shell> cd /path/to/datadir/db1
shell> ln -s tbl1.frm tbl2.frm
shell> ln -s tbl1.MYD tbl2.MYD
shell> ln -s tbl1.MYI tbl2.MYI
@end example

Now there will be problems if one thread reads @code{db1.tbl1} and another
thread updates @code{db1.tbl2}:

@itemize @minus
@item
The query cache will be fooled (it will believe @code{tbl1} has not been
updated so will return out-of-date results).
@item
The @code{ALTER} commands on @code{tbl2} will also fail.

@node Windows symbolic links,  , Symbolic links to tables, Symbolic links
@subsubsection Using Symbolic Links for Databases on Windows

@cindex symbolic links
@cindex using multiple disks to start data
@cindex disks, splitting data across

Beginning with MySQL Version 3.23.16, the @code{mysqld-max}
and @code{mysql-max-nt} servers in the MySQL distribution are
compiled with the @code{-DUSE_SYMDIR} option.  This allows you to put a
database directory on a different disk by setting up a symbolic link to it.
This is similar to the way that symbolic links work on Unix, though the
procedure for setting up the link is different.

On Windows, you make a symbolic link to a MySQL database by creating a file
in the data directory that contains the path to the destination directory.
The file should be named @file{db_name.sym}, where @code{db_name} is the
database name.

For example, if the MySQL data directory is @file{C:\mysql\data}
and you want to have database @code{foo} located at @file{D:\data\foo},
you should create the file @file{C:\mysql\data\foo.sym} that contains
the pathname @code{D:\data\foo\}.  After that, all tables created in
the database @code{foo} will be created in @file{D:\data\foo}.
(The @file{D:\data\foo} directory must already exist for this to work.) Also,
note that the symbolic link will not be used if a directory with
the database name exists in the MySQL data directory.  This means
that if you already have a database directory named @file{foo} in
the data directory, you must move it to @file{D:\data} before the
symbolic link will be effective.  (To avoid problems, the server
should not be running when you move the database directory.)

In MySQL 4.0, symbolic links are enabled by default. If you don't need them,
you can disable them with the @code{skip-symbolic-links} option:

@example
[mysqld]
skip-symbolic-links
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0, symbolic links are disabled by default. To enable them,
you should put the following entry in your @file{my.cnf} or @file{my.ini}
file:

@example
[mysqld]
symbolic-links

@end table

Each MySQL program takes many different options. However, every MySQL program
provides a @code{--help} option that you can use to get a full description
of the program's different options. For example, try @code{mysql --help}.

@cindex environment variables

MySQL clients that communicate with the server using the
@code{mysqlclient} library use the following environment variables:

@tindex @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT}
@tindex @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT}
@tindex @code{MYSQL_PWD} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_PWD}
@tindex @code{MYSQL_DEBUG} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_DEBUG}

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
@item @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT}
@tab The default Unix socket file; used for connections to @code{localhost}
@item @code{MYSQL_TCP_PORT} 
@tab The default port number; used for TCP/IP connections
@item @code{MYSQL_PWD}
@tab The default password
@item @code{MYSQL_DEBUG}
@tab Debug trace options when debugging
@item @code{TMPDIR}
@tab The directory where temporary tables and files are created
@end multitable

Use of @code{MYSQL_PWD} is insecure.
@xref{Password security}.

You can override the default option values or values specified in
environment variables for all standard programs by specifying options in an
option file or on the command line.
@ref{Program Options}.


@node myisampack, mysql, Client-Side Overview, Client-Side Scripts
@section @code{myisampack}, the MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator

@cindex compressed tables
@cindex tables, compressed
@cindex MyISAM, compressed tables
@cindex @code{myisampack}
@cindex @code{pack_isam}

The @code{myisampack} utility compresses @code{MyISAM} tables.
@code{myisampack} works by compressing each column in the table separately.
Usually, @code{myisampack} packs the data file 40%-70%.

When the table is used later, the information needed to decompress columns
is read into memory.  This results in much better performance when accessing
individual records, because you only have to uncompress exactly one record,
not a much larger disk block as when using Stacker on MS-DOS.

MySQL uses @code{mmap()} when possible to perform memory mapping on
compressed tables. If @code{mmap()} doesn't work, MySQL falls back to
normal read/write file operations.

A similar utility, @code{pack_isam}, compresses @code{ISAM} tables. Because
@code{ISAM} tables are deprecated, this section discusses only
@code{myisampack}, but the general procedures for using @code{myisampack}
are also true for @code{pack_isam} unless otherwise specified.

Please note the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If the @code{mysqld} server was invoked with the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option, it is not a good idea to invoke
@code{myisampack} if the table might be updated during the packing process.

@item
After packing a table, it becomes read-only. This is generally intended
(such as when accessing packed tables on a CD). Allowing writes
to a packed table is on our TODO list, but with low priority.

@item
@code{myisampack} can pack @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} columns.
The older @code{pack_isam} program for @code{ISAM} tables cannot.

@end itemize

Invoke @code{myisampack} like this:

@example
shell> myisampack [options] filename ...
@end example

Each filename should be the name of an index (@file{.MYI}) file.  If you
are not in the database directory, you should specify the pathname to the
file.  It is permissible to omit the @file{.MYI} extension.

@code{myisampack} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --backup, -b
Make a backup of the table data file using the name @file{tbl_name.OLD}.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --force, -f
Produce a packed table even if it becomes larger than the original or if
the temporary file from an earlier invocation of @code{myisampack} exists.
(@code{myisampack} creates a temporary file named @file{tbl_name.TMD} while
it compresses the table.  If you kill @code{myisampack}, the @file{.TMD}
file might not be deleted.)  Normally, @code{myisampack} exits with an
error if it finds that @file{tbl_name.TMD} exists.  With @code{--force},
@code{myisampack} packs the table anyway.

@item --join=big_tbl_name, -j big_tbl_name
Join all tables named on the command line into a single table
@code{big_tbl_name}.  All tables that are to be combined @strong{must}
have identical structure (same column names and types, same indexes,
and so forth).

@item --packlength=#, -p #
Specify the record length storage size, in bytes.  The value should be 1, 2,
or 3.  @code{myisampack} stores all rows with length pointers of 1, 2, or 3
bytes.  In most normal cases, @code{myisampack} can determine the right length
value before it begins packing the file, but it may notice during the packing
process that it could have used a shorter length. In this case,
@code{myisampack} will print a note that the next time you pack the same file,
you could use a shorter record length.

@item --silent, -s
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

@item --test, -t
Don't actually pack the table, just test packing it.

@item --tmp_dir=path, -T path
Use the named directory as the location in which to write the temporary table.

@item --verbose, -v
Verbose mode.  Write information about the progress of the packing operation
and its result.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.

@item --wait, -w

Wait and retry if the table is in use.  If the @code{mysqld} server was
invoked with the @code{--skip-external-locking} option, it is not a good idea
to invoke @code{myisampack} if the table might be updated during the
packing process.

@end table

@end example

@code{myisampack} displays the following kinds of information:

@table @code
@item normal
The number of columns for which no extra packing is used.

@item empty-space
The number of columns containing
values that are only spaces; these will occupy one bit.

@item empty-zero
The number of columns containing
values that are only binary zeros; these will occupy one bit.

@item empty-fill
The number of integer columns that don't occupy the full byte range of their
type; these are changed to a smaller type.  For example, a @code{BIGINT}
column (eight bytes) can be stored as a @code{TINYINT} column (one byte) if
all its values are in the range from @code{-128} to @code{127}.

@item pre-space
The number of decimal columns that are stored with leading spaces. In this
case, each value will contain a count for the number of leading spaces.

@item end-space
The number of columns that have a lot of trailing spaces.  In this case, each
value will contain a count for the number of trailing spaces.

@item table-lookup
The column had only a small number of different values, which were
converted to an @code{ENUM} before Huffman compression.

@item zero
The number of columns for which all values are zero.

@item Original trees
The initial number of Huffman trees.

@item After join
The number of distinct Huffman trees left after joining
trees to save some header space.
@end table

After a table has been compressed, @code{myisamchk -dvv} prints additional
information about each column:

@table @code
@item Type
The column type. The value may contain any of the following descriptors:

@table @code
@item constant
All rows have the same value.

@item no endspace
Don't store endspace.

@item no endspace, not_always
Don't store endspace and don't do endspace compression for all values.

@item no endspace, no empty
Don't store endspace. Don't store empty values.

@item table-lookup
The column was converted to an @code{ENUM}.

@item zerofill(n)
The most significant @code{n} bytes in the value are always 0 and are not
stored.

@item no zeros
Don't store zeros.

@item always zero
Zero values are stored using one bit.
@end table

@item Huff tree
The number of the Huffman tree associated with the column.

@item Bits
The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.
@end table

After you run @code{myisampack}, you must run
@code{myisamchk} to re-create any indexes.  At this time, you
can also sort the index blocks and create statistics needed for
the MySQL optimizer to work more efficiently:

@example
shell> myisamchk -rq --sort-index --analyze tbl_name.MYI
@end example

A similar procedure applies for @code{ISAM} tables. After using
@code{pack_isam}, use @code{isamchk} to re-create the indexes:

@example
shell> isamchk -rq --sort-index --analyze tbl_name.ISM
@end example

After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL database directory,
you should execute @code{mysqladmin flush-tables} to force @code{mysqld}
to start using the new table.

To unpack a packed table, use the @code{--unpack} option to @code{myisamchk}
or @code{isamchk}.

@code{mysql} is a simple SQL shell (with GNU @code{readline} capabilities).
It supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used interactively,
query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
tab-separated format.  The output format can be changed using command-line
options.

If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result sets, use the
@code{--quick} option!  This forces @code{mysql} to retrieve results from
the server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire result set
and buffering it in memory before displaying it.  This is done by using
@code{mysql_use_result()} rather than @code{mysql_store_result()} to
retrieve the result set.

Using @code{mysql} is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your command
interpreter as follows:

@example
shell> mysql db_name
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password db_name
@end example

Then type an SQL statement, end it with @samp{;}, @code{\g}, or @code{\G}
and press Enter.

You can run a script simply like this:

@example
shell> mysql db_name < script.sql > output.tab
@end example

The effect of this is described in the discussion for @code{IGNORE_SPACE} in
@ref{Server SQL mode}.

@item --local-infile[=@{0|1@}]
@cindex @code{local-infile}, @code{mysql} option
Enable or disable @code{LOCAL} capability for @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
With no value, the option enables @code{LOCAL}. It may be given as
@code{--local-infile=0} or @code{--local-infile=1} to explicitly disable
or enable @code{LOCAL}. Enabling @code{LOCAL} has no effect if the server
does not also support it.

@item --named-commands, -G
@cindex @code{named-commands}, @code{mysql} option
Named commands are @emph{enabled}.  Long format commands are allowed as
well as shortened \* commands. For example, @code{quit} and @code{\q} both
are recognized.

@item --no-auto-rehash, -A
@cindex @code{no-auto-rehash}, @code{mysql} option
No automatic rehashing.  This option causes @code{mysql} to start faster,
but you must issue the @code{rehash} command if you want to use table and
column name completion.

@item --no-beep, -b
@cindex @code{no-beep}, @code{mysql} option
Do not beep when errors occur.

@item --no-named-commands, -g
@cindex @code{no-named-commands}, @code{mysql} option
Named commands are disabled. Use the @code{\*} form only, or use
named commands only at the beginning of a line ending with a semicolon
(@samp{;}). As of MySQL 3.23.22, @code{mysql} starts with this option
@emph{enabled} by default!  However, even with this option, long-format
commands still work from the first line.

@item --one-database, -O
@cindex @code{one-database}, @code{mysql} option
Ignore statements except those for the default database named on the
command line.  This is useful for skipping updates to other databases in
the binary log.

@item --pager[=command]
@cindex @code{pager}, @code{mysql} option
Use the given command for paging query output.  If the command is
omitted, the default pager is the value of your @code{PAGER} environment
variable. Valid pagers are @code{less}, @code{more}, @code{cat [>
filename]}, and so forth.  This option works only on Unix.  It does not
work in batch mode.

@cindex @code{port}, @code{mysql} option
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

@item --prompt=format_str
@cindex @code{prompt}, @code{mysql} option
Set the prompt to the specified format. The default is @code{mysql>}.
The special sequences that the prompt can contain are described in
@ref{mysql Commands,  , @code{mysql} Commands}.

@item --protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}
@cindex @code{protocol}, @code{mysql} option
The connection protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

@item --quick, -q
@cindex @code{quick}, @code{mysql} option

the server if the output is suspended.  With this option, @code{mysql}
doesn't use the history file.

@item --raw, -r
@cindex @code{raw}, @code{mysql} option
Write column values without escape conversion. Often used with the
@code{--batch} option.

@item --reconnect
@cindex @code{reconnect}, @code{mysql} option
If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to reconnect. A
single reconnect attempt is made each time the connection is lost.  To
suppress reconnection behavior, use @code{--skip-reconnect}.
New in MySQL 4.1.0.

@item --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U
@cindex @code{safe-updates}, @code{mysql} option
Allow only @code{UPDATE} and @code{DELETE} statements that specify rows
to affect using key values.  If you have this option in an option file,
you can override it by using @code{--safe-updates} on the command line.
See @ref{mysql Tips,  , @code{mysql} Tips} for more information about
this option.

@item --silent, -s
@cindex @code{silent}, @code{mysql} option

Flush the buffer after each query.

@item --user=user_name, -u user_name
@cindex @code{user}, @code{mysql} option
The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server.

@item --verbose, -v
@cindex @code{verbose}, @code{mysql} option
Verbose mode. Produce more output. This option can be given multiple times
to produce more and more output.
(For example, @code{-v -v -v} produces the table output format even in batch
mode.)

@item --version, -V
@cindex @code{version}, @code{mysql} option
Display version information and exit.

@item --vertical, -E
@cindex @code{vertical}, @code{mysql} option

@end table

You can also set the following variables by using @code{--var_name=value}
options:

@cindex timeout, @code{connect_timeout} variable
@cindex @code{connect_timeout} variable
@cindex @code{max_allowed_packet} variable
@cindex @code{max_join_size} variable
@cindex @code{net_buffer_length} variable
@cindex @code{select_limit} variable

@table @code

@item connect_timeout
The number of seconds before connection timeout.
(Default value is 0.)

@item max_allowed_packet
The maximum packet length to send to or receive from the server.
(Default value is 16MB.)

@item max_join_size
The automatic limit for rows in a join when using @code{--safe-updates}.
(Default value is 1,000,000.)

@item net_buffer_length
The buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication.
(Default value is 16KB.)

@item select_limit
The automatic limit for @code{SELECT} statements when using
@code{--safe-updates}.
(Default value is 1,000.)

@end table

It is also possible to set variables by using
@code{--set-variable=var_name=value} or @code{-O var_name=value}
syntax. However, this syntax is deprecated as of MySQL 4.0.

@tindex @code{MYSQL_HISTFILE} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{MYSQL_HISTFILE}
@tindex @code{HOME} environment variable
@tindex environment variable, @code{HOME}
@cindex mysql history file
@cindex command-line history, mysql
@tindex .mysql_history file

On Unix, the @code{mysql} client writes a record of executed statements to a
history file.  By default, the history file is named @file{.mysql_history}
and is created in your home directory.  To specify a different file,
set the value of the @code{MYSQL_HISTFILE} environment variable.

If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove
@file{.mysql_history} if it exists, and then use either of the following
techniques:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Set the @code{MYSQL_HISTFILE} variable to @file{/dev/null}. To cause this
setting to take effect each time you log in, put the setting in one of
your shell's startup files.

@item
Create @file{.mysql_histfile} as a symbolic link to @file{/dev/null}:

@example
shell> ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history
@end example

You need do this only once.

@subsection @code{mysql} Commands

@c TODO: describe 4.1 help system

@code{mysql} sends SQL statements that you issue to the server to be
executed.  There is also a set of commands that @code{mysql} itself
interprets.  For a list of these commands, type @code{help} or @code{\h} at
the @code{mysql>} prompt:

@cindex mysql commands, list of
@example
mysql> help

MySQL commands:
?         (\h)    Synonym for `help'.

                  Takes database name as argument.
@end example

The @code{edit}, @code{nopager}, @code{pager}, and @code{system} commands
work only in Unix.

@cindex mysql status command
The @code{status} command provides some information about the
connection and the server you are using. If you are running in
@code{--safe-updates} mode, @code{status} also prints the values for
the @code{mysql} variables that affect your queries.

To log queries and their output, use the @code{tee} command.  All the data
displayed on the screen will be appended into a given file. This can be very
useful for debugging purposes also.  You can enable this feature on the
command line with the @code{--tee} option, or interactively with the @code{tee}
command.  The @code{tee} file can be disabled interactively with the
@code{notee} command. Executing @code{tee} again re-enables logging.
Without a parameter, the previous file will be used. Note that @code{tee}
flushes query results to the file after each statement, just before @code{mysql}
prints its next prompt.

Browsing or searching query results in interactive mode by using Unix
programs such as @code{less}, @code{more}, or any other similar program is
now possible with the @code{--pager} option. If you specify no value for the
option, @code{mysql} checks the value of the @code{PAGER} environment
variable and sets the pager to that.  Output paging can be enabled
interactively with the @code{pager} command and disabled with
@code{nopager}.  The command takes an optional argument; if given, the
paging program is set to that. With no argument, the pager is set to the
pager that was set on the command line, or @code{stdout} if no pager was
specified.

Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the @code{popen()}
function, which doesn't exist on Windows. For Windows, the @code{tee}
option can be used instead to save query output, although this is not as
convenient as @code{pager} for browsing output in some situations.

A few tips about the @code{pager} command:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can use it to write to a file and the results will go only to the file:

@example
mysql> pager cat > /tmp/log.txt
@end example

You can also pass any options for the program that you want to use as your
pager:

@example
mysql> pager less -n -i -S
@end example

@item
In the preceding example, note the @code{-S} option. You may find it very
useful for browsing wide query results.  Sometimes a very wide result set is
difficult to read on the screen.  The @code{-S} option to @code{less} can
make the result set much more readable because you can scroll it
horizontally using the left-arrow and right-arrow keys.  You can also use
@code{-S} interactively within @code{less} to switch the horizontal-browse
mode on and off.  For more information, read the @code{less} manual page:

@example
shell> man less
@end example

@item
You can specify very complex pager commands for handling query output:

@example
mysql> pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \
          | tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
@end example

In this example, the command would send query results to two files in two
different directories on two different filesystems mounted on @file{/dr1}
and @file{/dr2}, yet still display the results onscreen via @code{less}.

@end itemize

You can also combine the @code{tee} and @code{pager} functions. Have a
@code{tee} file enabled and @code{pager} set to @code{less}, and you will be
able to browse the results using the @code{less} program and still have
everything appended into a file the same time. The difference between the
Unix @code{tee} used with the @code{pager} command and the @code{mysql}
built-in @code{tee} command is that the built-in @code{tee} works even if
you don't have the Unix @code{tee} available. The built-in @code{tee} also
logs everything that is printed on the screen, whereas the Unix @code{tee}
used with @code{pager} doesn't log quite that much. Additionally, @code{tee}
file logging can be turned on and off interactively from within
@code{mysql}. This is useful when you want to log some queries to a file,
but not others.

@cindex mysql prompt command
From MySQL 4.0.2 on, the default @code{mysql>} prompt can be reconfigured.
The string for defining the prompt can contain the following special
sequences:

@c FIX these columnfractions have NOT been measured!

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .75
@item @strong{Option} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{\v}   @tab  The server version
@item @code{\d}   @tab  The current database
@item @code{\h}   @tab  The server host
@item @code{\p}   @tab  The current TCP/IP host
@item @code{\u}   @tab  Your username
@item @code{\U}   @tab  Your full @code{user_name@@host_name} account name
@item @code{\\}   @tab  A literal @samp{\} backslash character
@item @code{\n}   @tab  A newline character
@item @code{\t}   @tab  A tab character
@item @code{\ }   @tab  A space (a space follows the backslash)
@item @code{\_}   @tab  A space
@item @code{\R}   @tab  The current time, in 24-hour military time (0-23)
@item @code{\r}   @tab  The current time, standard 12-hour time (1-12)
@item @code{\m}   @tab  Minutes of the current time
@item @code{\y}   @tab  The current year, two digits
@item @code{\Y}   @tab  The current year, four digits
@item @code{\D}   @tab  The full current date
@item @code{\s}   @tab  Seconds of the current time
@item @code{\w}   @tab  The current day of the week in three-letter format (Mon, Tue, ...)
@item @code{\P}   @tab  am/pm
@item @code{\o}   @tab  The current month in numeric format
@item @code{\O}   @tab  The current month in three-letter format (Jan, Feb, ...)
@item @code{\c}   @tab  A counter that increments for each statement you issue
@end multitable

@samp{\} followed by any other letter just becomes that letter.

If you specify the @code{prompt} command with no argument, @code{mysql} resets
the prompt to the default of @code{mysql>}.

You can set the prompt in several ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item Use an environment variable

You can set the @code{MYSQL_PS1} environment variable to a prompt string.  For
example:

@example
shell> export MYSQL_PS1="(\u@@\h) [\d]> "
@end example

@item Use an option file

You can set the @code{prompt} option in the @code{[mysql]} group of any MySQL
option file, such as @file{/etc/my.cnf} or the @file{.my.cnf} file in
your home directory.
For example:

@example
[mysql]
prompt=(\\u@@\\h) [\\d]>\\_
@end example

In this example, note that the backslashes are doubled.
If you set the prompt using the @code{prompt} option in an option
file, it is advisable to double the backslashes when using the special
prompt options.  There is
some overlap in the set of allowable prompt options and the set of special
escape sequences that are recognized in option files.
(These sequences are listed in @ref{Option files}.)
The overlap may cause you problems if you use single backslashes.
For example, @code{\s} will be interpreted as a space rather than as the
current seconds value. The following example shows how to define a prompt
within an option file to
include the current time in @code{HH:MM:SS>} format:

@example
[mysql]
prompt="\\r:\\m:\\s> "
@end example

@item Use a command-line option

You can set the @code{--prompt} option on the command line to @code{mysql}.
For example:

@example
shell> mysql --prompt="(\u@@\h) [\d]> "
(user@@host) [database]> 
@end example

@item Interactively

You can change your prompt interactively by using the @code{prompt} (or
@code{\R}) command.  For example:

@example
mysql> prompt (\u@@\h) [\d]>\_
PROMPT set to '(\u@@\h) [\d]>\_'
(user@@host) [database]> 
(user@@host) [database]> prompt
Returning to default PROMPT of mysql> 
mysql>

@subsection Executing SQL Statements from a Text File

The @code{mysql} client typically is used interactively, like this:

@example
shell> mysql db_name
@end example

However, it's also possible to put your SQL statements in a file and then
tell @code{mysql} to read its input from that file.  To do so, create a text
file @file{text_file} that contains the statements you wish to execute.
Then invoke @code{mysql} as shown here:

@example
shell> mysql db_name < text_file
@end example

You can also start your text file with a @code{USE db_name} statement.  In
this case, it is unnecessary to specify the database name on the command
line:

@example
shell> mysql < text_file
@end example

If you are already running @code{mysql}, you can execute an SQL
script file using the @code{source} or @code{\.} command:

@example
mysql> source filename;
mysql> \. filename;
@end example

For more information about batch mode, see @ref{Batch mode}.

Some query results are much more readable when displayed vertically, instead
of in the usual horizontal table format. For example, longer text values that
include newlines often are much easier to read with vertical output:

@example

@subsubsection Using the @code{--safe-updates} Option

@cindex @code{safe-updates} option

For beginners, a useful startup option is @code{--safe-updates} (or
@code{--i-am-a-dummy}, which has the same effect).  This option was
introduced in MySQL 3.23.11.  It is helpful for cases when you might
have issued a @code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} statement but forgotten the
@code{WHERE} clause. Normally, such a statement will delete all rows from the
table.  With @code{--safe-updates}, you can delete rows only by specifying
the key values that identify them. This helps prevent accidents.

When you use the @code{--safe-updates} option, @code{mysql} issues the
following statement when it connects to the MySQL server:

@example
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=1000,
    SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=1000000;
@end example

@xref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET}}.

The @code{SET} statement has the following effects:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You are not allowed to execute an @code{UPDATE} or @code{DELETE} statement
unless you specify a key constraint in the @code{WHERE} clause or provide a
@code{LIMIT} clause (or both).
For example:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=# WHERE key_column=#;

UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=# LIMIT 1;
@end example

@item
All large @code{SELECT} results are automatically limited to 1,000 rows
unless the statement includes a @code{LIMIT} clause.

@item
Multiple-table @code{SELECT} statements that will probably need to examine
more than 1,000,000 row combinations are aborted.

@end itemize

To specify limits other than 1,000 and 1,000,000, you can override the
defaults by using @code{--select_limit} and @code{--max_join_size} options:

@example
shell> mysql --safe-updates --select_limit=500 --max_join_size=10000
@end example


@node mysql reconnect,  , safe-updates, mysql Tips
@subsubsection Disabling @code{mysql} Auto-Reconnect

If the @code{mysql} client loses its connection to the server while sending
a query, it will immediately and automatically try to reconnect once to the
server and send the query again.  However, even if @code{mysql} succeeds in
reconnecting, your first connection has ended and all your previous session
objects and settings are lost: temporary tables, the autocommit mode, and
user and session variables.  This behavior may be dangerous for you, as in
the following example where the server was shut down and restarted without
you knowing it:

@example
mysql> SET @@a=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(@@a);
ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...
Connection id:    1
Current database: test

Query OK, 1 row affected (1.30 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
| NULL |
+------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
@end example

The @code{@@a} user variable has been lost with the connection, and after
the reconnection it is undefined. If it is important to have @code{mysql}
terminate with an error if the connection has been lost, you can start the
@code{mysql} client with the @code{--skip-reconnect} option.

@node mysqlbinlog, mysqlcc, mysqladmin, Client-Side Scripts
@section The @code{mysqlbinlog} Binary Log Utility

@cindex @code{mysqlbinlog}

The binary log files that the server generates are written in binary format.
To examine these files in text format, use the @code{mysqlbinlog} utility.
It is available as of MySQL 3.23.14.

Invoke @code{mysqlbinlog} like this:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog [options] log-file ...
@end example

For example, to display the contents of the binary log @file{binlog.000003},
use this command:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog binlog.0000003
@end example

The output includes all statements contained in @file{binlog.000003},
together with other information such as the time each statement took, the
thread ID of the client that issued it, the timestamp when it was issued,
and so forth.

Normally, you use @code{mysqlbinlog} to read binary log files directly and
apply them to the local MySQL server. It is also possible to read binary
logs from a remote server by using the @code{--read-from-remote-server}
option. However, this is deprecated because we instead want to
make it easy to to apply binary logs to a local MySQL server.

When you read remote binary logs, the connection parameter options can be
given to indicate how to connect to the server, but they are ignored unless
you also specify the @code{--read-from-remote-server} option. These options
are @code{--host}, @code{--password}, @code{--port}, @code{--protocol},
@code{--socket}, and @code{--user}.

You can also use @code{mysqlbinlog} to read relay log files written by a
slave server in a replication setup. Relay logs have the same format as
binary log files.

The binary log is discussed further in @ref{Binary log}.

@code{mysqlbinlog} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --database=db_name, -d db_name
List entries for just this database (local log only).

@item --force-read, -f
Force reading of unknown binary log events.

@item --host=host_name, -h host_name
Get the binary log from the MySQL server on the given host.

@item --local-load=path, -l path
Prepare local temporary files for @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} in the specified
directory.

@item --offset=N, -o N
Skip the first @code{N} entries.

@item --password[=password], -p[password]
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that if you use the
short option form (@code{-p}), you @emph{cannot} have a space between the
option and the password.  If no password is given on the command line,
you will be prompted for one.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num
The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a remote server.

@item --position=N, -j N
Start reading the binary log at position @code{N}.

@item --protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}
The connection protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

@item --read-from-remote-server, -R
Read the binary log from a MySQL server.
Any connection parameter options are ignored unless this option is given as
well. These options are @code{--host}, @code{--password}, @code{--port},
@code{--protocol},
@code{--socket}, and @code{--user}.


@item --result-file=name, -r name
Direct output to the given file.

@item --short-form, -s
Display only the statements contained in the log, without any extra
information.

@item --socket=path, -S path
The socket file to use for the connection.

@item --user=user_name, -u user_name
The MySQL username to use when connecting to a remote server.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.

@end table

You can also set the following variable by using @code{--var_name=value}
options:

@cindex @code{open_files_limit} variable

@table @code

@item open_files_limit
Specify the number of open file descriptors to reserve.

@end table

You can pipe the output of @code{mysqlbinlog} into a @code{mysql} client to
execute the statements contained in the binary log. This is used to recover
from a crash when you have an old backup (@pxref{Backup}):

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000001 | mysql
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.[0-9]* | mysql
@end example

You can also redirect the output of @code{mysqlbinlog} to a text file
instead, if you need to modify the statement log first (for example, to
remove statements that you don't want to execute for some reason). After
editing the file, execute the statements that it contains by using it as
input to the @code{mysql} program.

@code{mysqlbinlog} has the @code{--position} option, which prints only
those statements with an offset in the binary log greater than or equal to
a given position.

If you have more than one binary log to execute on the MySQL server,
the safe method is to process them all using a single connection to the
server.  Here is an example that demonstrates what may be @emph{unsafe}:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000001 | mysql # DANGER!!
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000002 | mysql # DANGER!!
@end example

Processing binary logs this way using different connections to the server
will cause problems if the first log file contains a @code{CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE} statement and the second log contains a statement that uses the
temporary table. When the first @code{mysql} process terminates, the server
will drop the temporary table. When the second @code{mysql} process attempts
to use the table, the server will report ``unknown table.''

To avoid problems like this, use a single connection to execute the contents
of all binary logs that you want to process.  Here is one way to do that:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000001 hostname-bin.000002 | mysql
@end example

Another approach is to do this:

@example
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000001 >  /tmp/statements.sql
shell> mysqlbinlog hostname-bin.000002 >> /tmp/statements.sql
shell> mysql -e "source /tmp/statements.sql"
@end example

In MySQL 3.23, the binary log did not contain the data to load for
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statements. To execute such a statement from a
binary log file, the original data file was needed.  Starting from MySQL
4.0.14, the binary log does contain the data, so @code{mysqlbinlog} can
produce output that reproduces the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operation without
the original data file.  @code{mysqlbinlog} copies the data to a temporary
file and writes a @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} statement that refers to the
file.  The default location of the directory where these files are written
is system-specific. To specify a directory explicitly, use the
@code{--local-load} option.

Because @code{mysqlbinlog} converts @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statements to
@code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} statements (that is, it adds @code{LOCAL}),
both the client and the server that you use to process the statements must be
configured to allow @code{LOCAL} capability.
@xref{LOAD DATA LOCAL,  , @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}}.

@strong{Warning:} The temporary files created for @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}
statements are @emph{not} automatically deleted
because they are needed until you actually execute those statements.  You
should delete the temporary files yourself after you no longer need the
statement log.  The files can be found in the temporary file directory and
have names like @file{original_file_name-#-#}.

In the future, we will fix this problem by allowing @code{mysqlbinlog}
to connect directly to a @code{mysqld} server.  Then it will be possible
to safely remove the log files automatically as soon as the @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} statements have been executed.

Before MySQL 4.1, @code{mysqlbinlog} could not prepare output suitable for
@code{mysql} if the binary log contained intertwined statements originating
from different clients that used temporary tables of the same name.  This is
fixed in MySQL 4.1.

@section The @code{mysqlcheck} Table Maintenance and Repair Program

@c TODO: This is no longer fully accurate. mysqlcheck can be used for some
@c operations on table types other than MyISAM.

@c TODO: There probably should be more reference to this program from within
@c the table maintenance section.

The @code{mysqlcheck} client checks and repairs @code{MyISAM} tables.  It
can also optimize and analyze tables. @code{mysqlcheck} is available as of
MySQL 3.23.38.

@code{mysqlcheck} is similar in function to @code{myisamchk}, but works
differently.  The main operational difference is that @code{mysqlcheck} must
be used when the @code{mysqld} server is running, whereas @code{myisamchk}
should be used when it is not. The benefit of using @code{mysqlcheck} is
that you do not have to stop the server to check or repair your tables.

@code{mysqlcheck} uses the SQL statements @code{CHECK TABLE}, @code{REPAIR
TABLE}, @code{ANALYZE TABLE}, and @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} in a convenient way
for the user. It determines which statements to use for the operation you want
to perform, then sends the statements to the server to be executed.

There are three general ways to invoke @code{mysqlcheck}:

@example
shell> mysqlcheck [options] db_name [tables]
shell> mysqlcheck [options] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
shell> mysqlcheck [options] --all-databases
@end example

If you don't name any tables or use the @code{--databases} or
@code{--all-databases} option, entire databases will be checked.

@code{mysqlcheck} has a special feature compared to the other clients. The
default behavior of checking tables (@code{--check}) can be changed by renaming
the binary. If you want to have a tool that repairs tables by default, you
should just make a copy of @code{mysqlcheck} named @code{mysqlrepair}, or make
a symbolic link to @code{mysqlcheck} named @code{mysqlrepair}. If you invoke
@code{mysqlrepair}, it will repair tables by default.

The following names can be used to change @code{mysqlcheck} default behavior:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
@item @code{mysqlrepair}   @tab The default option will be @code{--repair}
@item @code{mysqlanalyze}  @tab The default option will be @code{--analyze}
@item @code{mysqloptimize} @tab The default option will be @code{--optimize}
@end multitable

@code{mysqlcheck} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --all-databases, -A
Check all tables in all databases. This is the same as using the
@code{--databases} option and naming all the databases on the command line.

@item --all-in-1, -1
Instead of issuing a statement for each table, execute a single statement for
each database that names all the tables from that database to be processed.

@item  --analyze, -a
Analyze the tables.

@item --auto-repair
If a checked table is corrupted, automatically fix it. Any necessary repairs
are done after all tables have been checked.

@item --character-sets-dir=path
The directory where character sets are installed.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --check, -c
Check the tables for errors.

@item --check-only-changed, -C
Check only tables that have changed since the last check or that haven't been
closed properly.

@item --compress
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both
support compression.

@item --databases, -B
Process all tables in the named databases. With this option, all name
arguments are regarded as database names, not as table names.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --default-character-set=charset
Use @code{charset} as the default character set.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --extended, -e
If you are using this option to check tables, it ensures that they are
100% consistent but will take a long time.

If you are using this option to repair tables, it runs an extended
repair that may not only take a long time to execute, but
may produce a lot of garbage rows also!

@item --fast, -F
Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.

@item --force, -f
Continue even if an SQL error occurs.

@item --host=host_name, -h host_name
Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

@item --medium-check, -m
Do a check that is faster than an @code{--extended} operation.
This finds only 99.99% of all errors, which should be good enough in most cases.

@item --optimize, -o
Optimize the tables.

@item --password[=password], -p[password]
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that if you use the
short option form (@code{-p}), you @emph{cannot} have a space between the
option and the password.  If no password is given on the command line,
you will be prompted for one.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

@item --protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}
The connection protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

@item --quick, -q
If you are using this option to check tables, it prevents the check
from scanning the rows to check for incorrect links. This is the fastest
check method.

If you are using this option to repair tables, it tries to repair
only the index tree. This is the fastest repair method.

@item --repair, -r
Do a repair that
can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique.

@item --silent, -s
Silent mode.
Print only error messages.

@item --socket=path, -S path
The socket file to use for the connection.

@item --tables
Overrides the @code{--databases} or @code{-B} option. All arguments 
following the option are regarded as table names.

@item --user=user_name, -u user_name
The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server.

@item --verbose, -v
Verbose mode.
Print information about the various stages of program operation.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.

@c TODO: indicate what privileges are required for the various dump operations
@c SELECT, LOCK, RELOAD

@cindex dumping, databases
@cindex databases, dumping
@cindex tables, dumping
@cindex backing up, databases

@cindex @code{mysqldump}
The @code{mysqldump} client can be used
to dump a database or a collection of databases for backup or for
transferring the data to another SQL server (not necessarily a MySQL
server).  The dump will contain SQL statements to create the table
and/or populate the table.

If you are doing a backup on the server, you should consider using
the @code{mysqlhotcopy} instead. @xref{mysqlhotcopy, , @code{mysqlhotcopy}}.

There are three general ways to invoke @code{mysqldump}:

@example
shell> mysqldump [options] db_name [tables]
shell> mysqldump [options] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
shell> mysqldump [options] --all-databases
@end example

If you don't name any tables or use the @code{--databases} or
@code{--all-databases} option, entire databases will be dumped.

To get a list of the options your version of @code{mysqldump} supports,
execute @code{mysqldump --help}.

If you run @code{mysqldump} without the @code{--quick} or
@code{--opt} option, @code{mysqldump} will load the whole result set into
memory before dumping the result.  This will probably be a problem if
you are dumping a big database. As of MySQL 4.1, @code{--opt} is on by
default, but can be disabled with @code{--skip-opt}.

If you are using a recent copy of the @code{mysqldump} program
and you are going to generate a dump that will be reloaded into a very old MySQL
server, you should not use the @code{--opt} or @code{-e} options.

@c TODO: Is this behavior now fixed?

Out-of-range numeric values such as @code{-inf} and @code{inf}, as well
as NaN (not-a-number) values are dumped by @code{mysqldump} as @code{NULL}.
You can see this using the following sample table:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t (f DOUBLE);
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(1e+111111111111111111111);
mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(-1e111111111111111111111);
mysql> SELECT f FROM t;
+------+
| f    |
+------+
|  inf |
| -inf |
+------+
@end example

For this table, @code{mysqldump} produces the following data output:

@example
--
-- Dumping data for table `t`
--

INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (NULL);
@end example

The significance of this behavior is that if you dump and restore the
table, the new table has contents that differ from the original contents.

@code{mysqldump} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --add-drop-table
Add a @code{DROP TABLE} statement before each @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.

@item --add-locks
Surround each table dump with @code{LOCK TABLES} and @code{UNLOCK TABLES}
statements. This results in faster inserts when the dump file is reloaded.
@xref{Insert speed}.

@item --all-databases, -A
Dump all tables in all databases. This is the same as using the
@code{--databases} option and naming all the databases on the command line.

@item --allow-keywords
Allow creation of column names that are keywords.  This works by
prefixing each column name with the table name.

@item --comments[=@{0|1@}]
If set to @code{0}, suppresses additional information in the dump file such
as program version, server version, and host. @code{--skip-comments} has the
same effect as @code{--comments=0}.  The default value is @code{1} to not
suppress the extra information.  New in MySQL 4.0.17.

@item --compatible=name
Produce output that
is compatible with other database systems or with older MySQL servers.
The value of @code{name} can be
@code{mysql323},
@code{mysql40},
@code{postgresql},
@code{oracle},
@code{mssql},
@code{db2},
@code{sapdb},
@code{no_key_options},
@code{no_table_options},
or
@code{no_field_options}.
To use several values, separate them by commas.
These values have the same meaning as the corresponding options for setting
the server SQL mode.
@xref{Server SQL mode}.

This option requires a server version of 4.1.0 or higher.
With older servers, it does nothing.

@item --complete-insert, -c
Use complete @code{INSERT} statements that include column names.

@item --compress, -C
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both
support compression.

@item --create-options
Include all MySQL-specific table options in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statements.
Before MySQL 4.1.2, use @code{--all} instead.

@item --databases, -B
To dump several databases. Note the difference in usage. In this case, no
tables are given. All name arguments on the command line are regarded as
database names.  A @code{USE db_name} statement is included in the
output before each new database.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --default-character-set=charset
Use @code{charset} as the default character set.  @xref{Character sets}.
If not specified, @code{mysqldump} 10.3 (MySQL-4.1.2) or later
uses @code{utf8}; earlier versions use @code{latin1}.

@item --delayed
Insert rows using @code{INSERT DELAYED} statements.

@item --delete-master-logs
On a master replication server, delete the binary
logs after performing the dump operation.
This option automatically enables @code{--first-slave}.
It was added in MySQL 3.23.57 (for MySQL 3.23) and MySQL 4.0.13 (for MySQL
4.0).

@item --disable-keys, -K
For each table, surround the @code{INSERT} statements with
@code{/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS */;} and
@code{/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS */;} statements.
This makes loading the dump file into a MySQL 4.0 server faster because the
indexes are created after all rows are inserted.
This option is effective only for @code{MyISAM} tables.

@item --extended-insert, -e
Use multiple-row @code{INSERT} syntax that include several @code{VALUES} lists.
This results in a smaller dump file and speeds up inserts when the file is
reloaded.

@item --fields-terminated-by=...
@itemx --fields-enclosed-by=...
@itemx --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...
@itemx --fields-escaped-by=...
@itemx --lines-terminated-by=...
These options are used with the @code{-T} option and have the same
meaning as the corresponding clauses for @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
@xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

@item --first-slave, -x
Locks all tables across all databases.

@item --flush-logs, -F
Flush the MySQL server log files before starting the dump. Note that if you
use this option in combination with the @code{--all-databases} (or
@code{-A}) option, the logs are flushed @emph{for each database dumped}.

@item --force, -f
Continue even if an SQL error occurs during a table dump.

@item --host=host_name, -h host_name
Dump data from the MySQL server on the given host. The default host
is @code{localhost}.

@item --lock-tables, -l
Lock all tables before starting the dump.  The tables are locked with
@code{READ LOCAL} to allow concurrent inserts in the case of @code{MyISAM}
tables.

Please note that when dumping multiple databases, @code{--lock-tables} locks
tables for each database separately. So, using this option will not guarantee
that the tables in the dump file will be logically consistent between
databases.  Tables in different databases may be dumped in completely
different states.

@item --master-data
This option is like @code{--first-slave}, but also produces @code{CHANGE
MASTER TO} statements that will make your slave server start from the correct
position in the master's binary logs if you use this SQL dump of the master
to set up the slave.

@item --no-create-db, -n
This option suppresses the @code{CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/
db_name} statements that are otherwise included in the output if the
@code{--databases} or @code{--all-databases} option is given.

@item --no-create-info, -t
Don't write @code{CREATE TABLE} statements that re-create each dumped table.

@item --no-data, -d
Don't write any row information for the table.  This is very useful if you
just want to get a dump of the structure for a table.

@item --opt
This option is shorthand; it is the same as specifying @code{--add-drop-table
--add-locks --create-options --disable-keys --extended-insert
--lock-tables --quick --set-charset}.  It should
give you a fast dump operation and produce a dump file that can be reloaded
into a MySQL server quickly. As of MySQL 4.1, @code{--opt} is on by default,
but can be disabled with @code{--skip-opt}. To disable only certain of the
options enabled by @code{--opt}, use their @code{--skip} forms; for example,
@code{--skip-add-drop-table} or @code{--skip-quick}.

@item --password[=password], -p[password]
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that if you use the
short option form (@code{-p}), you @emph{cannot} have a space between the
option and the password.  If no password is given on the command line,
you will be prompted for one.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

@item --protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}
The connection protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

@item  --quick, -q
This option is useful for dumping large tables.
It forces @code{mysqldump} to retrieve rows for a table from
the server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire row set
and buffering it in memory before writing it out.

@item --quote-names, -Q
Quote database, table, and column names within @samp{`} characters.
If the server SQL mode includes the @code{ANSI_QUOTES} option, names are
quoted within @samp{"} characters.
As of MySQL 4.1.1, @code{--quote-names} is on by default,
but can be disabled with @code{--skip-quote-names}.

@item --result-file=file, -r file
Direct output to a given file. This option should be used on Windows, because
it prevents newline @samp{\n} characters from being converted to @samp{\r\n}
carriage return/newline sequences.

@item --single-transaction
This option issues a @code{BEGIN} SQL statement before dumping data from
the server. It is mostly useful with @code{InnoDB} tables and
@code{READ COMMITTED} transaction isolation level, because in this mode it
will dump the consistent state of the database at the time then
@code{BEGIN} was issued without blocking any applications.

When using this option, you should keep in mind that only transactional
tables will be dumped in a consistent state. For example, any @code{MyISAM} or
@code{HEAP} tables dumped while using this option may still change
state.

The @code{--single-transaction} option was added in version 4.0.2.
This option is mutually exclusive with the @code{--lock-tables} option,
because @code{LOCK TABLES} causes any pending transactions to be committed
implicitly.

@item --socket=path, -S path
The socket file to use when connecting to @code{localhost} (which is the
default host).

@item --skip-comments
See the description for the @code{--comments} option.

@item  --tab=path, -T path
Produces tab-separated data files.  For each dumped table, @code{mysqldump}
creates a @file{tbl_name.sql} file that contains the @code{CREATE TABLE}
statement that creates the table, and a @file{tbl_name.txt} file that
contains its data.  The option value is the directory in which to write the
files.

By default, the @file{.txt} data files are formatted using tab characters
between column values and a newline at the end of each line.  The format can
be specified explicitly using the @code{--fields-xxx} and
@code{--lines--xxx} options.

@strong{Note:} This option should be used only when @code{mysqldump} is run
on the same machine as the @code{mysqld} server. You must use a MySQL
account that has the @code{FILE} privilege, and the server must have
permission to write files in the directory you specify.

@item --tables
Overrides the @code{--databases} or @code{-B} option. All arguments 
following the option are regarded as table names.

@item --user=user_name, -u user_name
The MySQL username to use when connecting to the server.

@item --verbose, -v
Verbose mode.  Print out more information on what the program does.

@item --version, -V
Display version information and exit.

@item --where='where-condition', -w 'where-condition'
Dump only records selected by the given @code{WHERE} condition.  Note that
quotes around the condition are mandatory if it contains spaces or
characters that are special to your command interpreter.

Examples:

@example
"--where=user='jimf'"
"-wuserid>1"
"-wuserid<1"
@end example

@item --xml, -X
Write dump output as well-formed XML.

@end table

You can also set the following variables by using @code{--var_name=value}
options:

@table @code

@item max_allowed_packet
The maximum size of the buffer for client/server communication.
The value of the variable can be up to 16MB before MySQL 4.0, and
up to 1GB from MySQL 4.0 on.
When creating multiple-row-insert statements (as with option
@code{--extended-insert} or @code{--opt}), @code{mysqldump} will create
rows up to @code{max_allowed_packet} length. If you increase this
variable, you should also ensure that the @code{max_allowed_packet}
variable in the MySQL server is at least this large.

@item net_buffer_length
The initial size of the buffer for client/server communication.

@end table

It is also possible to set variables by using
@code{--set-variable=var_name=value} or @code{-O var_name=value}
syntax. However, this syntax is deprecated as of MySQL 4.0.

The most common use of @code{mysqldump} is probably for making a backup of
entire databases.

@example
shell> mysqldump --opt db_name > backup-file.sql
@end example

You can read the dump file back into the server with:

@example
shell> mysql db_name < backup-file.sql
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> mysql -e "source /path-to-backup/backup-file.sql" db_name
@end example

@code{mysqldump} is also very useful for populating databases by copying
data from one MySQL server to another:

@example
shell> mysqldump --opt db_name | mysql --host=remote-host -C db_name
@end example

It is possible to dump several databases with one command:

@example
shell> mysqldump --databases db_name1 [db_name2 ...] > my_databases.sql
@end example

If you want to dump all databases, use the @code{--all-databases} option:

@example
shell> mysqldump --all-databases > all_databases.sql
@end example

@item --flushlog
Flush logs after all tables are locked.

@item --keepold
Don't delete previous (now renamed) target when done.

@item --method=#
Method for copy (@code{cp} or @code{scp}).

@item --noindices
Don't include full index files in the backup. This makes the backup smaller
and faster.  The indexes can be reconstructed later with @code{myisamchk -rq}.

@item --password=password, -ppassword
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that the password
value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MySQL clients.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num
The TCP/IP port number to use when connecting to the local server.

@item --quiet, -q

The @code{mysqlimport} client provides a command-line interface to the
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} SQL statement.  Most options to @code{mysqlimport}
correspond directly to clauses of @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
@xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

Invoke @code{mysqlimport} like this:

@example
shell> mysqlimport [options] db_name textfile1 [textfile2 ...]
@end example

For each text file named on the command line, @code{mysqlimport} strips any
extension from the filename and uses the result to determine the name of the
table into which to import the file's contents.  For example, files named
@file{patient.txt}, @file{patient.text}, and @file{patient} all would be
imported into a table named @code{patient}.

@code{mysqlimport} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --columns=column_list, -c column_list
This option takes a comma-separated list of column names as its value. The
order of the column names indicates how to match up data file columns with
table columns.

@item --compress, -C
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both
support compression.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --delete, -D
Empty the table before importing the text file.

@item --fields-terminated-by=...
@itemx --fields-enclosed-by=...
@itemx --fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...
@itemx --fields-escaped-by=...
@itemx --lines-terminated-by=...
These options have the same meaning as the corresponding clauses for
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE}. @xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

@item --force, -f
Ignore errors.  For example, if a table for a text file doesn't exist,
continue processing any remaining files.  Without @code{--force},
@code{mysqlimport} exits if a table doesn't exist.

@item --host=host_name, -h host_name
Import data to the MySQL server on the given host. The default host
is @code{localhost}.

@item --ignore, -i
See the description for the @code{--replace} option.

@item --ignore-lines=n
Ignore the first @code{n} lines of the data file.

@item --local, -L
Read input files from the client host.  By default, text files are assumed to be on
the server host if you connect to @code{localhost} (which is the default host).

@item --lock-tables, -l
Lock @emph{all} tables for writing before processing any text files. This
ensures that all tables are synchronized on the server.

@item --password[=password], -p[password]
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that if you use the
short option form (@code{-p}), you @emph{cannot} have a space between the
option and the password.  If no password is given on the command line,
you will be prompted for one.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num

The @code{--replace} and @code{--ignore} options control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
@code{--replace}, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify @code{--ignore}, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text

@cindex showing, database information

The @code{mysqlshow} client can be used to quickly look at which databases
exist, their tables, and a table's columns or indexes.

@code{mysqlshow} provides a command-line interface to several SQL
@code{SHOW} statements.  The same information can be obtained by using those
statements directly.  For example, you can issue them from the @code{mysql}
client program.
@xref{SHOW,  , @code{SHOW}}.

Invoke @code{mysqlshow} like this:

@example
shell> mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]
@end example

@itemize @bullet
@item
If no database is given, all matching databases are shown.
@item
If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are shown.
@item
If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the table
are shown.
@end itemize

Note that in newer MySQL versions, you see only those
database, tables, or columns for which you have some privileges.

If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters (@samp{*},
@samp{?}, @samp{%}, or @samp{_}), only those names that are matched by the
wildcard are shown.  If a database name contains any underscores, those
should be escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells will require two) in
order to get a list of the proper tables or columns. @samp{*} and @samp{?}
characters are converted into SQL @samp{%} and @samp{_} wildcard characters.
This might cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for a
table with a @samp{_} in the name, because in this case @code{mysqlshow}
shows you only the table names that match the pattern.  This is easily fixed
by adding an extra @samp{%} last on the command line as a separate
argument.

@code{mysqlshow} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --help, -?
Display a help message and exit.

@item --character-sets-dir=path
The directory where character sets are installed.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --compress, -C
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both
support compression.

@item --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
Write a debugging log. The @code{debug_options} string often is
@code{'d:t:o,file_name'}.

@item --default-character-set=charset
Use @code{charset} as the default character set.  @xref{Character sets}.

@item --host=host_name, -h host_name
Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

@item --keys, -k
Show table indexes.

@item --password[=password], -p[password]
The password to use when connecting to the server.  Note that if you use the
short option form (@code{-p}), you @emph{cannot} have a space between the
option and the password.  If no password is given on the command line,
you will be prompted for one.

@item --port=port_num, -P port_num
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

@item --protocol=@{TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY@}
The connection protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

@section @code{perror}, Explaining Error Codes

@cindex error messages, displaying
@cindex perror

@cindex errno
@cindex Errcode

For most system errors, MySQL displays, in addition to an internal text
message, the system error code in one of the following styles:

@example
message ... (errno: #)
message ... (Errcode: #)
@end example

You can find out what the error code means by either examining the
documentation for your system or by using the @code{perror} utility.

@code{perror} prints a description for a system error code or for a storage
engine (table handler) error code.

Invoke @code{perror} like this:

@example
shell> perror [options] errorcode ...
@end example

Example:

@example
shell> perror 13 64
Error code  13:  Permission denied
Error code  64:  Machine is not on the network
@end example

Note that the meaning of system error messages may be dependent on your
operating system. A given error code may mean different things on different
operating systems.

@section The @code{replace} String-replacement Utility

@cindex string replacement, replace utility
@cindex replace utility

The @code{replace} utility program changes strings in place in files or on
the standard input. It uses a finite state machine to match longer strings
first. It can be used to swap strings. For example, the following command
swaps @code{a} and @code{b} in the given files, @file{file1} and @file{file2}:

@example
shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...
@end example

Use the @code{--} option to indicate where the string-replacement list
ends and the filenames begin.

Any file named on the command line is modified in place, so you may want to
make a copy of the original before converting it.

If no files are named on the command line, @code{replace} reads the standard
input and writes to the standard output.  In this case, no @code{--} option is
needed.

The @code{replace} program is used by @code{msql2mysql}.
@xref{msql2mysql}.

@code{replace} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item -?, -I

@subsection Strings

A string is a sequence of characters, surrounded by either single quote
(@samp{'}) or double quote (@samp{"}) characters.  Examples:

@example
'a string'
"another string"
@end example

If the server SQL mode has @code{ANSI_QUOTES} enabled, string literals can be
quoted only with single quotes. A string quoted with double quotes will be
interpreted as an identifier.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, string literals may have an optional character set
introducer and @code{COLLATE} clause:

@cindex introducer, string literal
@cindex string literal introducer

@example
[_character_set_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
@end example

Examples:
@example
SELECT _latin1'string';
SELECT _latin1'string' COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
@end example

For more information about these forms of string syntax, see
@ref{Charset-literal}.

Within a string, certain sequences have special meaning.  Each of these
sequences begins with a backslash (@samp{\}), known as the @emph{escape
character}.  MySQL recognizes the following escape sequences:

@c these aren't really functions, but that's probably the most reasonable index

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .90
@item @code{\0}
@findex \0 (ASCII 0)
@findex NUL
@tab An ASCII 0 (@code{NUL}) character.

@item @code{\'}
@findex \' (single quote)
@findex single quote (\')
@tab A single quote (@samp{'}) character.

@item @code{\"}
@findex \" (double quote)
@findex double quote (\")
@tab A double quote (@samp{"}) character.

@item @code{\b}
@findex \b (backspace)
@findex backspace (\b)
@tab A backspace character.

@item @code{\n}
@findex \n (newline)
@findex newline (\n)
@findex \n (linefeed)
@findex linefeed (\n)
@tab A newline (linefeed) character.

@item @code{\r}
@findex \r (carriage return)
@findex return (\r)
@findex carriage return (\r)
@tab A carriage return character.

@item @code{\t}
@findex \t (tab)
@findex tab (\t)
@tab A tab character.

@item @code{\z}
@findex \z (Control-Z) ASCII 26
@findex (Control-Z) \z
@tab ASCII 26 (Control-Z).  This character can be encoded as @samp{\z}
to allow you to
work around the problem that ASCII 26 stands for END-OF-FILE on Windows.
(ASCII 26 will cause problems if you try to use
@code{mysql db_name < file_name}.)

@item @code{\\}
@findex \\ (escape)
@findex escape (\\)
@tab A backslash (@samp{\}) character.

@item @code{\%}
@findex % (wildcard character)
@findex Wildcard character (%)
@tab A @samp{%} character. See note following table.

@item @code{\_}
@findex _ (wildcard character)
@findex Wildcard character (_)
@tab A @samp{_} character. See note following table.

@end multitable

These sequences are case sensitive. For example, @samp{\b} is interpreted as
a backslash, but @samp{\B} is interpreted as @samp{B}.

The @samp{\%} and @samp{\_} sequences are used to search for literal
instances of @samp{%} and @samp{_} in pattern-matching contexts where
they would otherwise be interpreted as wildcard characters. @xref{String
comparison functions}.
Note that if you use @samp{\%} or @samp{\_} in other contexts, they
return the strings @samp{\%} and @samp{\_} and not @samp{%} and
@samp{_}.

In all other escape sequences, backslash is ignored.  That is,
the escaped character is interpreted as if it was not escaped.

@cindex quotes, in strings
@noindent
There are several ways to include quotes within a string:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A @samp{'} inside a string quoted with @samp{'} may be written as @samp{''}.

@item
A @samp{"} inside a string quoted with @samp{"} may be written as @samp{""}.

@item
You can precede the quote character with an escape character (@samp{\}).

@item
A @samp{'} inside a string quoted with @samp{"} needs no special treatment
and need not be doubled or escaped.  In the same way, @samp{"} inside a
string quoted with @samp{'} needs no special treatment.
@end itemize

The following @code{SELECT} statements demonstrate how quoting and
escaping work:

@example
mysql> SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
| hello | "hello" | ""hello"" | hel'lo | 'hello |
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql> SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+
| hello | 'hello' | ''hello'' | hel"lo | "hello |
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql> SELECT 'This\nIs\nFour\nLines';
+--------------------+
| This
Is
Four
Lines |
+--------------------+

mysql> SELECT 'disappearing\ backslash';
+------------------------+
| disappearing backslash |
+------------------------+
@end example

@cindex quoting binary data

If you want to insert binary data into a string column (such as a
@code{BLOB}), the following characters must be represented by escape
sequences:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .90


@item @code{NUL}
@tab @code{NUL} byte (ASCII 0).
Represent this character by @samp{\0} (a backslash followed by an ASCII @samp{0} character).

@item @code{\}
@tab Backslash (ASCII 92).  Represent this character by @samp{\\}.

@item @code{'}
@tab Single quote (ASCII 39).  Represent this character by @samp{\'}.

@item @code{"}
@tab Double quote (ASCII 34).  Represent this character by @samp{\"}.

@end multitable

@cindex quoting
@cindex @code{BLOB}, inserting binary data
@findex mysql_real_escape_string()
@findex DBI->quote
When writing application programs, any string that might contain any of these
special characters
must be properly escaped before the string is used as a data value in an SQL
statement that is sent to the MySQL server.
You can do this in two ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Process the string with a function that escapes the special characters.
For example, in a C program, you can use the C API function
@code{mysql_real_escape_string()} to escape characters.
@xref{mysql_real_escape_string,  , @code{mysql_real_escape_string()}}.
The Perl DBI interface provides a
@code{quote} method to convert special characters to the proper escape
sequences.  @xref{Perl}.

@item
As an alternative to explicitly escaping special characters,
many MySQL APIs provide a placeholder capability
that allows you to insert special markers into a query string, and then bind
data values to them when you issue the query.  In this case, the API takes
care of escaping special characters in the values for you.

@subsection Numbers

@cindex numbers
@cindex valid numbers, examples
@cindex integers
@cindex floats

Integers are represented as a sequence of digits. Floats use @samp{.} as a
decimal separator.  Either type of number may be preceded by @samp{-} to
indicate a negative value.

Examples of valid integers:

@example
1221

-32
@end example

Examples of valid floating-point numbers:

@example
294.42
-32032.6809e+10
148.00
@end example

An integer may be used in a floating-point context; it is interpreted
as the equivalent floating-point number.


@node Hexadecimal values, Boolean values, Number syntax, Literals
@subsection Hexadecimal Values

@tindex hexadecimal values

MySQL supports hexadecimal values.  In numeric contexts, these act
like integers (64-bit precision). In string contexts, these act like binary
strings, where each pair of hex digits is converted to a character:

@example
mysql> SELECT x'4D7953514C';
        -> 'MySQL'
mysql> SELECT 0xa+0;
        -> 10
mysql> SELECT 0x5061756c;
        -> 'Paul'
@end example

In MySQL 4.1 (and in MySQL 4.0 when using the @code{--new} option), the default
type of of a hexadecimal value is a string.  If you want to ensure that
the value is treated as a number, you can use @code{CAST(... AS UNSIGNED)}:

@example
mysql> SELECT 0x41, CAST(0x41 AS UNSIGNED);
        -> 'A', 65
@end example

The @code{0x} syntax is based on ODBC.  Hexadecimal strings are often used by
ODBC to supply values for @code{BLOB} columns.
The @code{x'hexstring'} syntax is new in 4.0 and is based on standard SQL.

Beginning with MySQL 4.0.1, you can convert a string or a number to a string
in hexadecimal format with the @code{HEX()} function:

@example
mysql> SELECT HEX('cat');
        -> '636174'
mysql> SELECT 0x636174;
        -> 'cat'
@end example

@node Boolean values, NULL values, Hexadecimal values, Literals
@subsection Boolean Values

Beginning with MySQL 4.1, the constant @code{TRUE} evaluates to @code{1} and
the constant @code{FALSE} evaluates to @code{0}. The constant names can be
written in any lettercase.

@example
mysql> SELECT TRUE, true, FALSE, false;
        -> 1, 1, 0, 0
@end example


@node NULL values,  , Boolean values, Literals
@subsection @code{NULL} Values

@tindex NULL value

The @code{NULL} value means ``no data.''
@code{NULL} can be written in any lettercase.

Be aware that the @code{NULL} value is different than values such
as @code{0} for numeric types or the empty string for string types.
@xref{Problems with NULL, , Problems with @code{NULL}}.

For text file import or export operations performed with @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} or @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}, @code{NULL} is represented by
the @code{\N} sequence.

@cindex legal names
@cindex databases, names
@cindex tables, names
@cindex indexes, names
@cindex columns, names
@cindex aliases, names

Database, table, index, column, and alias names are identifiers.
This section describes the allowable syntax for identifiers in MySQL.

The following table describes the maximum length and allowable characters for
each type of identifier.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .70
@item @strong{Identifier} @tab @strong{Maximum Length (bytes)} @tab @strong{Allowed Characters}
@item Database @tab 64 @tab Any character that is allowed in a directory name except @samp{/}, @samp{\}, or @samp{.}
@item Table @tab 64 @tab Any character that is allowed in a filename, except @samp{/}, @samp{\}, or @samp{.}
@item Column @tab 64 @tab All characters
@item Index @tab 64 @tab All characters
@item Alias @tab 255 @tab All characters
@end multitable

In addition to the restrictions noted in the table, no identifier can contain
ASCII 0 or a byte with a value of 255. Before MySQL 4.1, identifier quote
characters should not be used in identifiers.

Beginning with MySQL 4.1, identifiers are stored using Unicode (UTF8).
This applies to identifiers in table definitions that stored in @file{.frm}
files and to identifiers stored in the grant tables in the @code{mysql}
database. Although Unicode identifiers can include multi-byte characters, note
that the maximum lengths shown in the table are byte counts. If an identifier
does contain multi-byte characters, the number of @emph{characters} allowed in
the identifier is less than the value shown in the table.

@tindex identifiers, quoting
@tindex quoting of identifiers
@tindex `
@tindex "

An identifier may be quoted or unquoted.  If an identifier is a reserved
word or contains special characters, you @emph{must} quote it whenever you
refer to it.  For a list of reserved words, see @ref{Reserved words}.
Special characters are those outside the set of alphanumeric characters from
the current character set, @samp{_}, and @samp{$}.

The quote character is the backtick (@samp{`}):

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM `select` WHERE `select`.id > 100;
@end example

If the server SQL mode includes the @code{ANSI_QUOTES} mode option,
it is also allowable to quote identifiers with double quotes:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
ERROR 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax. (...)
mysql> SET sql_mode='ANSI_QUOTES';
mysql> CREATE TABLE "test" (col INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
@end example

@xref{SQL mode}.

As of MySQL 4.1, identifier quote characters can be included within an
identifier by quoting the identifier. If the character to be included within
the identifier is the same as that used to quote the identifier itself,
double the character. The following statement creates a table named @code{a`b}
that contains a column named @code{c"d}:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE `a``b` (`c"d` INT);
@end example

Identifier quoting was introduced in MySQL 3.23.6 to allow use of
identifiers that are reserved words or that contain special characters.
Before 3.23.6, you cannot use identifiers that require quotes, so the rules for
legal identifiers are more restrictive:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A name may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current character set,
@samp{_}, and @samp{$}. The default character set is ISO-8859-1
(Latin1). This may be changed with the @code{--default-character-set} option
to @code{mysqld}.
@xref{Character sets}.

@item
A name may start with any character that is legal in a name.  In particular,
a name may start with a digit; this differs from many other database
systems!  However, an unquoted name cannot consist @emph{only} of digits.

@item
You cannot use the @samp{.} character in names because it is used to extend the
format by which you can refer to columns (@pxref{Identifier qualifiers}).
@end itemize

It is recommended that you do not use names like @code{1e}, because
an expression like @code{1e+1} is ambiguous. It might be interpreted as the
expression @code{1e + 1} or as the number @code{1e+1}, depending on context.


@node Identifier qualifiers, Name case sensitivity, Legal names, Legal names
@subsection Identifier Qualifiers

MySQL allows names that consist of a single identifier or
multiple identifiers. The components of a multiple-part name should be
separated by period (@samp{.}) characters. The initial parts of a
multiple-part name act as qualifiers that affect the context within which
the final identifier is interpreted.

In MySQL you can refer to a column using any of the following forms:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .70
@item @strong{Column Reference} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{col_name} @tab The column @code{col_name}
from whichever table used in the query contains a column of that name.
@item @code{tbl_name.col_name} @tab The column @code{col_name} from table
@code{tbl_name} of the default database.
@item @code{db_name.tbl_name.col_name} @tab The column @code{col_name} from table
@code{tbl_name} of the database @code{db_name}.  This syntax is unavailable
before MySQL 3.22.
@end multitable

If any components of a multiple-part name require quoting, quote them
individually rather than quoting the name as a whole. For example,
@code{`my-table`.`my-column`} is legal, whereas @code{`my-table.my-column`} is
not.

You need not specify a @code{tbl_name} or @code{db_name.tbl_name} prefix for
a column reference in a statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.
Suppose that tables @code{t1} and @code{t2} each contain a column
@code{c}, and you retrieve @code{c} in a @code{SELECT} statement that uses
both @code{t1} and @code{t2}.  In this case, @code{c} is ambiguous because it
is not unique among the tables used in the statement. You must qualify it
with a table name as @code{t1.c} or @code{t2.c} to indicate which table you
mean.  Similarly, to retrieve from a table @code{t} in database @code{db1}
and from a table @code{t} in database @code{db2} in the same statement,
you must refer to columns in those tables as @code{db1.t.col_name}
and @code{db2.t.col_name}.

@cindex ODBC compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with ODBC
The syntax @code{.tbl_name} means the table @code{tbl_name} in the current
database.  This syntax is accepted for ODBC compatibility because some ODBC

In MySQL, databases correspond to directories within the data directory.
Tables within a database correspond to at least one file within the database
directory (and possibly more, depending on the storage engine).
Consequently, the case sensitivity of the
underlying operating system determines the case sensitivity of database and
table names.  This means database and table names are not case sensitive in
Windows, and case sensitive in most varieties of Unix. One notable
exception is Mac OS X, which is Unix-based but uses a default filesystem type
(HFS+) that is not
case sensitive.  However, Mac OS X also supports UFS volumes, which are case
sensitive just as on any Unix.
@xref{Extensions to ANSI}.

@strong{Note:} Although database and table names are not case sensitive on
some platforms, you should not refer to a given database or table using
different
cases within the same query.  The following query would not work because it
refers to a table both as @code{my_table} and as @code{MY_TABLE}:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
@end example

Column names, index names,
and column aliases are not case sensitive on any platform.

Table aliases are case sensitive before MySQL 4.1.1.  The following
query would not work because it refers to the alias both as @code{a} and
as @code{A}:

@example
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
    -> WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
@end example

If you have trouble remembering the allowable lettercase for database
and table names, adopt a consistent convention, such as always creating
databases and tables using lowercase names.

How table names are stored on disk and used in MySQL is defined by the
@code{lower_case_table_names} system variable, which you can set when
starting @code{mysqld}.  @code{lower_case_table_names} can take one of
the following values:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .90

@item @strong{Value} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{0} @tab Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the @code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{CREATE DATABASE} statement. Name comparisons are case sensitive.  This is the default on Unix systems. Note that if you force this to 0 with @code{--lower-case-table-names=0} on a case-insensitive filesystem and access @code{MyISAM} tablenames using different lettercases, this may lead to index corruption.

@item @code{1} @tab Table names are stored in lowercase on disk and name comparisons are not case sensitive. MySQL converts all table names to lowercase on storage and lookup.  This behavior also applies to database names as of MySQL 4.0.2, and to table aliases as of 4.1.1. This value is the default on Windows and Mac OS X systems.

@item @code{2} @tab Table and database names are stored on disk using the lettercase specified in the @code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{CREATE DATABASE} statement, but MySQL converts them to lowercase on lookup.  Name comparisons are not case sensitive.  @strong{Note:} This works @emph{only} on filesystems that are not case sensitive! @code{InnoDB} table names are stored in lowercase, as for @code{lower_case_table_names=1}. Setting @code{lower_case_table_names} to @code{2} can be done as of MySQL 4.0.18.

@end multitable

If you are using MySQL on only one platform, you don't normally have to
change the @code{lower_case_table_names} variable. However, you may
encounter difficulties if you want to transfer tables between platforms
that differ in filesystem case sensitivity. For example, on Unix, you
can have two different tables named @code{my_table} and @code{MY_TABLE},
but on Windows those names are considered the same.  To avoid data
transfer problems stemming from database or table name lettercase, you
have two options:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use @code{lower_case_table_names=1} on all systems. The main disadvantage
with this is that when you use @code{SHOW TABLES} or @code{SHOW DATABASES},
you don't see the names in their original lettercase.

@item
Use @code{lower_case_table_names=0} on Unix and @code{lower_case_table_names=2}
on Windows. This preserves the lettercase of database and table names.
The disadvantage of this is that you must ensure that your queries always refer
to your database and table names with the correct lettercase on Windows. If
you transfer your queries to Unix, where lettercase is significant, they will
not work if the lettercase is incorrect.
@end itemize

Note that before setting @code{lower_case_table_names} to 1 on Unix, you must
first convert your old database and table names to lowercase before restarting
@code{mysqld}.

@node Variables, System Variables, Legal names, Language Structure
@section User Variables

@cindex variables, user
@cindex user variables
@cindex names, variables

MySQL supports user variables as of version 3.23.6. You can store a value in
a user variable and refer to it later, which allows you to pass values from
one statement to another. User variables are connection-specific. That is,
a variable defined by one client cannot be seen or used by other clients.
All variables for a client connection are automatically freed when the
client exits.

User variables are written as @code{@@var_name}, where the variable name
@code{var_name} may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current
character set, @samp{.}, @samp{_}, and @samp{$}. The default character set
is ISO-8859-1 (Latin1). This may be changed with the
@code{--default-character-set} option to @code{mysqld}. @xref{Character
sets}. User variable names are not case insensitive beginning with MySQL 5.0.
Before that, they are case sensitive.

One way to set a user variable is by issuing a @code{SET} statement:

@example
SET @@var_name = expression [,@@var_name = expression] ...
@end example

For @code{SET}, either @code{=} or @code{:=} can be used as the assignment
operator.  The @code{expression} assigned to each variable can evaluate
to an integer, real, string, or @code{NULL} value.

You can also assign a value to a user variable in statements other than
@code{SET}.  In this case, the assignment operator must be @code{:=} and not
@code{=} because @code{=} is treated as a comparison operator
in non-@code{SET} statements:

@example
mysql> SET @@t1=0, @@t2=0, @@t3=0;
mysql> SELECT @@t1:=(@@t2:=1)+@@t3:=4,@@t1,@@t2,@@t3;
+----------------------+------+------+------+
| @@t1:=(@@t2:=1)+@@t3:=4 | @@t1  | @@t2  | @@t3  |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
|                    5 |    5 |    1 |    4 |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
@end example

User variables may be used where expressions are allowed.  This
does not currently include contexts that explicitly require a number, such
as in the @code{LIMIT} clause of a @code{SELECT} statement, or the
@code{IGNORE number LINES} clause of a @code{LOAD DATA} statement.

If you refer to a variable that has not been initialized, its value
is @code{NULL}.

@strong{Note:} In a @code{SELECT} statement, each expression is evaluated
only when sent to the client.  This means that in a @code{HAVING},
@code{GROUP BY}, or @code{ORDER BY} clause, you cannot refer to an expression
that involves variables that are set in the @code{SELECT} list. For example,
the following statement will @emph{not} work as expected:

@example
mysql> SELECT (@@aa:=id) AS a, (@@aa+3) AS b FROM tbl_name HAVING b=5;
@end example

The reference to @code{b} in the @code{HAVING} clause refers to an alias
for an expression in the @code{SELECT} list that uses @code{@@aa}. This
does not work as expected: @code{@@aa} will not contain the value of the
current row, but the value of @code{id} from the previous selected row.

The general rule is to never assign @emph{and} use the same variable in
the same statement.

Another issue with setting a variable and using it in the same statement
is that the default result type of a variable is based on the type of
the variable at the start of the statement.  The following example
illustrates this:

@example
mysql> SET @@a='test';
mysql> SELECT @@a,(@@a:=20) FROM tbl_name;
@end example

For this @code{SELECT} statement, MySQL will report to the client that
column one is a string and convert all accesses of @code{@@a} to strings,
even though @@a is set to a number for the second row.  After the
@code{SELECT} statement executes, @code{@@a} will be regarded as a
number for the next statement.

To avoid problems with this behavior, either do not set and use the same
variable within a single statement, or else set the variable to @code{0},
@code{0.0}, or @code{''} to define its type before you use it.

An unassigned variable has a value of @code{NULL} with a type of string.

* Structured System Variables::  Structured System Variables
@end menu

Starting from MySQL 4.0.3, we provide better access to a lot of system
and connection variables. Many variables can be changed dynamically while
the server is running. This allows you to modify server operation without
having to stop and restart it.

@c NOTE: next few paragraphs also appear in @node Server system variables.
@c If you make changes one place, change them both.

The @code{mysqld} server maintains two kinds of variables.
Global variables affect the overall operation of the server.
Session variables affect its operation for individual client connections.

When the server starts, it initializes all global variables to their default
values. These defaults may be changed by options specified in option files
or on the command line.  After the server starts, those global variables
that are dynamic can be changed by connecting to the server and issuing
a @code{SET GLOBAL var_name} statement. To change a global variable,
you must have the @code{SUPER} privilege.

The server also maintains a set of session variables for each client
that connects. The client's session variables are initialized at connect
time using the current values of the corresponding global variables. For
those session variables that are dynamic, the client can change them
by issuing a @code{SET SESSION var_name} statement. Setting a session
variable requires no special privilege, but a client can change only its
own session variables, not those of any other client.

A change to a global variable is visible to any client that accesses that
global variable. However, it affects the corresponding session variable
that is intialized from the global variable only for clients that connect
after the change.  It does not affect the session variable for any client
that is already connected (not even that of the client that issues the
@code{SET GLOBAL} statement).

Global or session variables may be set or retrieved using several syntax
forms.  The following examples use @code{sort_buffer_size} as a sample variable
name.

To set the value of a @code{GLOBAL} variable, use one
of the following syntaxes:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size=value;
mysql> SET @@@@global.sort_buffer_size=value;
@end example

To set the value of a @code{SESSION} variable, use one of the
following syntaxes:

@example
mysql> SET SESSION sort_buffer_size=value;
mysql> SET @@@@session.sort_buffer_size=value;
mysql> SET sort_buffer_size=value;
@end example

@code{LOCAL} is a synonym for @code{SESSION}.

If you don't specify @code{GLOBAL}, @code{SESSION}, or @code{LOCAL} when
setting a variable, @code{SESSION} is the default.
@xref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET OPTION}}.

To retrieve the value of a @code{GLOBAL} variable, use one of the
following statements:

@example
mysql> SELECT @@@@global.sort_buffer_size;
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
@end example

To retrieve the value of a @code{SESSION} variable, use one of the
following statements:

@example
mysql> SELECT @@@@sort_buffer_size;
mysql> SELECT @@@@session.sort_buffer_size;
mysql> SHOW SESSION VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
@end example

Here, too, @code{LOCAL} is a synonym for @code{SESSION}.

When you retrieve a variable with @code{SELECT @@@@var_name} (that is, you
do not specify @code{global.}, @code{session.}, or @code{local.}, MySQL returns
the @code{SESSION} value if it exists and the @code{GLOBAL} value otherwise.

For @code{SHOW VARIABLES}, if you do not specify @code{GLOBAL},
@code{SESSION}, or @code{LOCAL}, MySQL returns the @code{SESSION} value.

The reason for requiring the @code{GLOBAL} keyword when setting
@code{GLOBAL}-only variables but not when retrieving them is to prevent
problems in the future.  If we remove a @code{SESSION}
variable with the same name as a @code{GLOBAL} variable, a client with the
@code{SUPER} privilege might accidentally change the @code{GLOBAL} variable
rather than just the @code{SESSION} variable for its own connection.  If we
add a @code{SESSION} variable with the same name as a @code{GLOBAL}
variable, a client that intends to change the @code{GLOBAL} variable might
find only its own @code{SESSION} variable changed.

Further information about system startup options and system
variables can be found in @ref{Server options} and
@ref{Server system variables}.
A list of the variables that can be set at runtime is given in
@ref{Dynamic System Variables}.


@node Structured System Variables,  , System Variables, System Variables
@subsection Structured System Variables

Structured system variables are supported beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.
A structured variable differs from a regular system variable in two
respects:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Its value is a structure with components that specify
server parameters considered to be closely related.
@item
There might be several instances of a given type of structured variable.
Each one has a different name and refers to a different resource
maintained by the server.
@end itemize

Currently, MySQL supports one structured variable type. It specifies
parameters that govern the operation of key caches. A key cache structured
variable has these components:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{key_buffer_size}
@item
@code{key_cache_block_size}
@item
@code{key_cache_division_limit}
@item
@code{key_cache_age_threshold}
@end itemize

The purpose of this section is to describe the syntax for referring to
structured variables. Key cache variables are used for syntax examples,
but specific details about how key caches operate are found elsewhere, in
@ref{MyISAM key cache,  , @code{MyISAM} key cache}.

To refer to a component of a structured variable instance, you can use a
compound name in @code{instance_name.component_name} format. Examples:

@example
hot_cache.key_buffer_size
hot_cache.key_cache_block_size
cold_cache.key_cache_block_size
@end example

For each structured system variable, an instance with the name of
@code{default} is always predefined.  If you refer to a component of a
structured variable without any instance name, the @code{default} instance
is used.  Thus, @code{default.key_buffer_size} and @code{key_buffer_size}
both refer to the same system variable.

The naming rules for structured variable instances and components are as
follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For a given type of structured variable, each instance must have a name
that is unique @emph{within} variables of that type. However, instance names
need not be unique @emph{across} structured variable types. For example,
each structured variable will have an instance named @code{default},
so @code{default} is not unique across variable types.

@item
The names of the components of each structured variable type must be
unique across all system variable names.  If this were not true (that is, if
two different types of structured variables could share component
member names), it would not be clear which default structured variable
to use for references to member names that are not qualified by an
instance name.

@item
If a structured variable instance name is not legal as an unquoted identifier,
refer to it as a quoted identifier using backticks. For example,
@code{hot-cache} is not legal, but @code{`hot-cache`} is.

@item
@code{global}, @code{session}, and @code{local} are not legal instance
names. This avoids a conflict with notation such as @code{@@@@global.var_name}
for referring to non-structured system variables.

@end itemize

At the moment, the first two rules have no possibility of being violated
because the only structured variable type is the one for key caches.
These rules will assume greater significance if some other type of structured
variable is created in the future.

With one exception, it is allowable to refer to structured variable
components using compound names in any context where simple variable
names can occur.  For example, you can assign a value to a structured
variable using a command-line option:

@example
shell> mysqld --hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
@end example

In an option file, do this:

@example
[mysqld]
hot_cache.key_buffer_size=64K
@end example

If you start the server with such an option, it creates a key cache
named @code{hot_cache} with a size of 64KB in addition to the default
key cache that has a default size of 8MB.

Suppose that you start the server as follows:

@example
shell> mysqld --key_buffer_size=256K \
         --extra_cache.key_buffer_size=128K \
         --extra_cache.key_cache_block_size=2096
@end example

In this case, the server sets the size of the default key cache to 256KB.
(You could also have written @code{--default.key_buffer_size=256K}.)
In addition, the server creates a second key cache named @code{extra_cache}
that has a size of 128KB, with the size of block buffers for caching
table index blocks set to 2096 bytes.

The following example starts the server with three different key caches
having sizes in a 3:1:1 ratio:

@example
shell> mysqld --key_buffer_size=6M \
         --hot_cache.key_buffer_size=2M \
         --cold_cache.key_buffer_size=2M
@end example

Structured variable values may be set and retrieved at runtime as well.
For example, to set a key cache named @code{hot_cache} to a size of 10MB,
use either of these statements:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
mysql> SET @@@@global.hot_cache.key_buffer_size = 10*1024*1024;
@end example

To retrieve the cache size, do this:

@example
mysql> SELECT @@@@global.hot_cache.key_buffer_size;
@end example

However, the following statement does not work. The variable is not
interpreted as a compound name, but as a simple string for a @code{LIKE}
pattern-matching operation:

@example
mysql> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'hot_cache.key_buffer_size';
@end example

This is the exception to being able to use structured variable names anywhere
a simple variable name may occur.


@node Comments, Reserved words, System Variables, Language Structure
@section Comment Syntax

@findex Comment syntax

@cindex comments, adding

@c TODO: this is really the place to describe /*!...*/ and /*!nnnnn ... */
@c comment syntax.

The MySQL server supports three comment styles:

@itemize @bullet
@item
From a @samp{#} character to the end of the line.

@item
From a @samp{--@ } sequence to the end of the line.
This style is supported as of MySQL 3.23.3.
Note that the @samp{--@ } (double-dash) comment style requires the second dash
to be followed by at least one space (or by a control character such as a
newline). This syntax differs slightly from standard SQL comment syntax, as discussed in
@ref{ANSI diff comments}.

@item
From a @samp{/*} sequence to the following @samp{*/} sequence.
The closing sequence need not be on the same line, so this
syntax allows a comment to extend over multiple lines.

@end itemize

The following example demonstrates all three comment styles:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql> SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql> SELECT 1+
/*
this is a
multiple-line comment
*/
1;
@end example

The comment syntax just described applies to how the @code{mysqld} server
parses SQL statements. The @code{mysql} client program also performs some
parsing of statements before sending them to the server. (For example, it
does this to determine statement boundaries within a multiple-statement input
line.) However, there are some limitations on the way that @code{mysql}
parses @code{/* ... */} comments:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A single-quote, double-quote, or backtick character is taken to indicate the beginning
of a quoted string or identifier, even within a comment.  If the quote is not matched by a
second quote within the comment, the parser doesn't realize the comment has
ended.  If you are running @code{mysql} interactively, you can tell that it
has gotten confused like this because the prompt changes from @code{mysql>}
to @code{'>}, @code{">}, or @code{`>}.
This problem was fixed in MySQL 4.1.1.

@item
A semicolon within the comment is taken to indicate the end of the current
SQL statement and anything following it to indicate the beginning of the
next statement.  This problem was fixed in MySQL 4.0.13.
@end itemize

For affected versions of MySQL,
these limitations apply both when you run @code{mysql} interactively
and when you put commands in a file and use @code{mysql} in batch mode to
process the file with @code{mysql < file_name}.


@node Reserved words,  , Comments, Language Structure
@section Treatment of Reserved Words in MySQL

@cindex keywords
@cindex reserved words, exceptions

A common problem stems from trying to use an identifier such as a table or
column name that is the name of a built-in MySQL data type or function,
such as @code{TIMESTAMP} or @code{GROUP}.  You're allowed
to do this (for example, @code{ABS} is allowed as a column name). However,
by default, no whitespace is allowed in function invocations between the
function name and the following @samp{(} character. This requirement allows
a function call to be distinguished from a reference to a column name.

A side effect of this behavior is that omitting a space in some contexts
causes an identifier to be interpreted as a function name. For example, this
statement is legal:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE abs (val INT);
@end example

But omitting the space after @code{abs} causes a syntax error because the
statement then appears to invoke the @code{ABS()} function:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE abs(val INT);
@end example

If the server SQL mode includes the @code{IGNORE_SPACE} mode value, the
server allows function invocations to have whitespace between a function
name and the following @samp{(} character. This causes function names to be
treated as reserved words. As a result, identifiers that are the same as
function names must be quoted as described in @ref{Legal names}.  The server
SQL mode is controlled as described in @ref{SQL mode}.

The words in the following table are explicitly reserved in MySQL. Most of
them are forbidden by standard SQL as column and/or table names (for example,
@code{GROUP}).  A few are reserved because MySQL needs them and (currently)
uses a @code{yacc} parser.  A reserved word can be used as an identifier by
quoting it.

@include reservedwords.texi

The following keywords are allowed by MySQL as column/table names. This
is because they are very natural names and a lot of people have already
used them.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{ACTION}
@item @code{BIT}

Improved support for character set handling was added to MySQL in Version
4.1.  The features described here are as implemented in MySQL 4.1.1.
(MySQL 4.1.0 has some but not all of these features, and some of them are
implemented differently.)

This chapter discusses the following topics:

@itemize @bullet
@item What are character sets and collations?
@item The multiple-level default system
@item New syntax in MySQL 4.1
@item Affected functions and operations
@item Unicode support
@item The meaning of each individual character set and collation

Character set support currently is included in the @code{MySISAM},
@code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}), and (as of MySQL 4.1.2) @code{InnoDB} storage
engines.  The @code{ISAM} storage engine does not include character set
support; there are no plans to change this, because @code{ISAM} is
deprecated.


@node Charset-general, Charset-MySQL, Charset, Charset
@section Character Sets and Collations in General


A @strong{character set} is a set of symbols and encodings. A @strong{collation} is a set of rules for comparing characters in a
character set. Let's make the distinction clear with an example of
an imaginary character set.


Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters: @samp{A}, @samp{B}, @samp{a},
@samp{b}. We give each letter a number: @samp{A} = 0, @samp{B} = 1, @samp{a} =
2, @samp{c} =
3. The letter @samp{A} is a symbol, the number 0 is the @strong{encoding}
for @samp{A}, and the combination of all four letters and their
encodings is a @strong{character set}.


Now, suppose that we want to compare two string values, @samp{A} and @samp{B}.
The simplest way to do this is to look at the encodings: 0 for
@samp{A} and 1 for @samp{B}. Because 0 is less than 1, we say @samp{A} is less
than @samp{B}. Now, what we've just done is apply a collation to our
character set. The collation is a set of rules (only one rule in
this case): ``compare the encodings.'' We call this simplest of all
possible collations a @strong{binary} collation.


But what if we want to say that the lowercase and uppercase
letters are equivalent? Then we would have at least two rules: (1)
treat the lowercase letters @samp{a} and @samp{b} as equivalent to @samp{A} and
@samp{B}; (2) then compare the encodings. We call this a
@strong{case-insensitive} collation. It's a little more complex than a
binary collation.


In real life, most character sets have many characters: not just
@samp{A} and @samp{B} but whole alphabets, sometimes multiple alphabets or
eastern writing systems with thousands of characters, along with
many special symbols and punctuation marks. Also in real life, most
collations have many rules: not just case insensitivity but also
accent insensitivity (an ``accent'' is a mark attached to a character
as in German @samp{@"O}) and multiple-character mappings (such as the
rule that @samp{@"O} = @samp{OE} in one of the two German collations).

MySQL 4.1 can do these things for you:

@itemize @bullet
@item Store strings using a variety of character sets
@item Compare strings using a variety of collations
@item Mix strings with different character sets or collations in the
same server, the same database, or even the same table
@item Allow specification of character set and collation at any
level

@end itemize

In these respects, not only is MySQL 4.1 far more flexible than
MySQL 4.0, it also is far ahead of other DBMSs. However, to use the
new features effectively, you will need to learn what character
sets and collations are available, how to change their defaults,
and what the various string operators do with them.

@c NOTE: If you rerun the following command, trim off the Maxlen column.
@c Otherwise, the lines are too long to fit nicely on the page.

@example
mysql> SHOW CHARACTER SET;
+----------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
| Charset  | Description                 | Default collation   |
+----------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
| big5     | Big5 Traditional Chinese    | big5_chinese_ci     |
| dec8     | DEC West European           | dec8_swedish_ci     |
| cp850    | DOS West European           | cp850_general_ci    |
| hp8      | HP West European            | hp8_english_ci      |
| koi8r    | KOI8-R Relcom Russian       | koi8r_general_ci    |
| latin1   | ISO 8859-1 West European    | latin1_swedish_ci   |
| latin2   | ISO 8859-2 Central European | latin2_general_ci   |
...
@end example

The output actually includes another column that is not shown so that the
example fits better on the page.

Any given character set always has at least one collation. It may have
several collations.

To list the collations for a character set, use the @code{SHOW COLLATION}
statement. For example, to see the collations for the @code{latin1}
(``ISO-8859-1 West European'') character set, use this statement to find
those collation names that begin with @code{latin1}:

@example
mysql> SHOW COLLATION LIKE 'latin1%';
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| Collation         | Charset | Id | Default | Compiled | Sortlen |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| latin1_german1_ci | latin1  |  5 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_swedish_ci | latin1  |  8 | Yes     | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_danish_ci  | latin1  | 15 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_german2_ci | latin1  | 31 |         | Yes      |       2 |
| latin1_bin        | latin1  | 47 |         | Yes      |       1 |
| latin1_general_ci | latin1  | 48 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_general_cs | latin1  | 49 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_spanish_ci | latin1  | 94 |         |          |       0 |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
@end example

The @code{latin1} collations have the following meanings:

@multitable @columnfractions .4 .6

@item @strong{Collation} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{latin1_bin} @tab Binary according to @code{latin1} encoding
@item @code{latin1_danish_ci} @tab Danish/Norwegian
@item @code{latin1_general_ci} @tab Multilingual
@item @code{latin1_general_cs} @tab Multilingual, case sensitive
@item @code{latin1_german1_ci} @tab German DIN-1
@item @code{latin1_german2_ci} @tab German DIN-2
@item @code{latin1_spanish_ci} @tab Modern Spanish
@item @code{latin1_swedish_ci} @tab Swedish/Finnish

@end multitable

Collations have these general characteristics:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Two different character sets cannot have the same collation.

@item
Each character set has one collation that is the @emph{default
collation}. For example, the default collation for @code{latin1} is
@code{latin1_swedish_ci}.

@item
There is a convention for collation names: They start
with the name of the character set with which they are associated, they
usually include a language name, and they end with @code{_ci} (case
insensitive), @code{_cs} (case sensitive), @code{_bin} (binary), or
@code{_uca}

There are default settings for character sets and collations at
four levels: server, database, table, and connection. The following
description may appear complex, but it has been found in practice
that multiple-level defaulting leads to natural and obvious
results.


@node Charset-server, Charset-database, Charset-defaults, Charset-defaults
@subsection Server Character Set and Collation

The MySQL Server has a server character set and a server collation,
which may not be null.

MySQL determines the server character set and server collation
thus:

@itemize @bullet

@item
According to the option settings in effect when the server starts
@item
According to the values set at runtime

@end itemize

At the server level, the decision is simple. The server
character set and collation depend initially on the
options that you use when you start @code{mysqld}. You can use
@code{--default-character-set} for the character set, and
along with it you can add @code{--default-collation} for the
collation. If you don't specify a character set, that is the same as saying
@code{--default-character-set=latin1}. If you specify only a character set
(for example, @code{latin1}) but not a collation, that is the same as saying
@code{--default-charset=latin1} @code{--default-collation=latin1_swedish_ci}
because @code{latin1_swedish_ci} is the default collation for @code{latin1}.
Therefore, the following three commands all have the same effect:

@example
shell> mysqld
shell> mysqld --default-character-set=latin1
shell> mysqld --default-character-set=latin1 \
           --default-collation=latin1_swedish_ci
@end example


One way to change the settings is by recompiling. If you want to
change the default server character set and collation when building
from sources, use: @code{--with-charset} and @code{--with-collation}
as arguments for @code{configure}. For example:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-charset=latin1
@end example

Or:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-charset=latin1 \
           --with-collation=latin1_german1_ci
@end example

Both @code{mysqld} and @code{configure} verify that the character
set/collation combination is valid. If not, each program displays an error
message and terminates.

The current server character set and collation are available as the values of
the @code{character_set_server} and @code{collation_server} system variables.
These variables can be changed at runtime.


@node Charset-database, Charset-table, Charset-server, Charset-defaults
@subsection Database Character Set and Collation

Every database has a database character set and a database
collation, which may not be null. The @code{CREATE DATABASE} and @code{ALTER
DATABASE} statements have optional clauses for specifying the
database character set and collation:

@example
CREATE DATABASE db_name
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET character_set_name]
    [[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]

ALTER DATABASE db_name
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET character_set_name]
    [[DEFAULT] COLLATE collation_name]
@end example

Example:

@example
CREATE DATABASE db_name
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci;
@end example

MySQL chooses the database character set and database collation
thus:

@itemize @bullet
@item If both @code{CHARACTER SET X} and @code{COLLATE Y} were specified, then
character set @code{X} and collation @code{Y}.
@item If @code{CHARACTER SET X} was specified without @code{COLLATE}, then
character set @code{X} and its default collation.
@item Otherwise, the server character set and server collation.

@end itemize


MySQL's @code{CREATE DATABASE ... DEFAULT CHARACTER SET ...} syntax is
analogous to the standard SQL @code{CREATE SCHEMA ... CHARACTER SET ...}
syntax. Because of this, it is possible to create databases with
different character sets and collations on the same MySQL
server.


The database character set and collation are used as default
values if the table character set and collation are not specified
in @code{CREATE TABLE} statements. They have no other purpose.

The character set and collation for the default database are available as
the values of the @code{character_set_database} and
@code{collation_database} system variables.  The server sets these variables
whenever the default database changes.  If there is no default database, the
variables have the same value as the corresponding server-level variables,
@code{character_set_server} and @code{collation_server}.


@node Charset-table, Charset-column, Charset-database, Charset-defaults
@subsection Table Character Set and Collation

Every table has a table character set and a table collation, which
may not be null. The @code{CREATE TABLE} and @code{ALTER TABLE} statements
have optional clauses for specifying the table character set and
collation:

@example
CREATE TABLE tbl_name ( column_list )
    [DEFAULT CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]

ALTER TABLE tbl_name
    [DEFAULT CHARACTER SET character_set_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
@end example

Example:

@example
CREATE TABLE t1 ( ... )
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
@end example


MySQL chooses the table character set and collation thus:

@itemize @bullet
@item If both @code{CHARACTER SET X} and @code{COLLATE Y} were specified, then
character set @code{X} and collation @code{Y}.
@item If @code{CHARACTER SET X} was specified without @code{COLLATE}, then
character set @code{X} and its default collation.
@item Otherwise, the database character set and collation.

@end itemize



The table character set and collation are used as default
values if the column character set and collation are not specified
in individual column definitions. The table character set and
collation are MySQL extensions; there are no such things in
standard SQL.


@node Charset-column, Charset-examples, Charset-table, Charset-defaults
@subsection Column Character Set and Collation

Every ``character'' column (that is, a column of type @code{CHAR},
@code{VARCHAR}, or @code{TEXT}) has a column character set and a column
collation, which may not be null. Column definition syntax has optional
clauses for specifying the column character set and collation:

@example
col_name @{CHAR | VARCHAR | TEXT@} (col_length)
    [CHARACTER SET character_set_name [COLLATE collation_name]]
@end example

Example:

@example
CREATE TABLE Table1
(
    column1 VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
);
@end example


MySQL chooses the column character set and collation thus:

@itemize @bullet
@item If both @code{CHARACTER SET X} and @code{COLLATE Y} were specified, then
character set @code{X} and collation @code{Y}.
@item If @code{CHARACTER SET X} was specified without @code{COLLATE}, then
character set @code{X} and its default collation.
@item Otherwise, the table character set and collation.

@end itemize

The @code{CHARACTER SET} and @code{COLLATE} clauses are standard SQL.


@node Charset-examples, Charset-connection, Charset-column, Charset-defaults
@subsection Examples of Character Set and Collation Assignment

The following examples show how MySQL determines default character set and
collation values.

@subsubheading Example 1: Table + Column Definition

@example
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_bin;
@end example

Here we have a column with a @code{latin1} character set
and a @code{latin1_german1_ci} collation. The definition is explicit, so
that's straightforward. Notice that there's no problem storing a
@code{latin1} column in a @code{latin2} table.

@subsubheading Example 2: Table + Column Definition

@example
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET latin1
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
@end example

This time we have a column with a @code{latin1} character
set and a default collation. Now, although it might seem natural,
the default collation is not taken from the table level. Instead,
because the default collation for @code{latin1} is always
@code{latin1_swedish_ci},
column @code{c1} will have a collation of @code{latin1_swedish_ci} (not
@code{latin1_danish_ci}).

@subsubheading Example 3: Table + Column Definition


@example
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
@end example

We have a column with a default character set and
a default collation. In this circumstance, MySQL looks up to the
table level for inspiration in determining the column character set and
collation. So, the character set for column @code{c1} is
@code{latin1} and its collation is @code{latin1_danish_ci}.

@subsubheading Example 4: Database + Table + Column Definition

@example
CREATE DATABASE d1
    DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin2 COLLATE latin2_czech_ci;
USE d1;
CREATE TABLE t1
(
    c1 CHAR(10)
);
@end example

We create a column without specifying its
character set and collation. We're also not specifying a character
set and a collation at the table level. In this circumstance, MySQL
looks up to the database level for inspiration. (The database's
settings become the table's settings, and thereafter become the
column's setting.) So, the character set for column @code{c1} is @code{latin2}
and its collation is @code{latin2_czech_ci}.


@node Charset-connection, Charset-literal, Charset-examples, Charset-defaults
@subsection Connection Character Sets and Collations

Several character set and collation system variables relate to a client's
interaction with the server. Some of these have already been mentioned in
earlier sections:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The server character set and collation are available as the values of the
@code{character_set_server} and @code{collation_server} variables.

@item
The character set and collation of the default database are available as the
values of the @code{character_set_database} and @code{collation_database}
variables.

@end itemize

Additional character set and collation variables are involved in handling
traffic for the connection between a client and the server.  Every client has
connection-related character set and collation variables.

Consider what a ``connection'' is: It's what you make when you connect to
the server. The client sends SQL statements, such as queries, over the
connection to the server. The server sends responses, such as result sets,
over the connection back to the client. This leads to several questions
about character set and collation handling for client connections, each of
which can be answered in terms of system variables:

@itemize @bullet

@item
What character set is the query in when it leaves the client?

The server takes the @code{character_set_client} variable to be the
character set in which queries are sent by the client.

@item
What character set should the server translate a query to after receiving it?

For this, @code{character_set_connection} and @code{collation_connection}
are used by the server.  It converts queries sent by the client from
@code{character_set_client} to @code{character_set_connection}
(except for string literals that have an introducer such as @code{_latin1} or
@code{_utf8}).
@code{collation_connection} is important for comparisons of literal strings.
For comparisons of strings with column values, it does not matter because
columns have a higher collation precedence.

@item
What character set should the server translate to before shipping result
sets or error messages back to the client?

The @code{character_set_results} variable indicates the character set in
which the server returns query results to the client. This includes result
data such as column values, and result metadata such as column names.

@end itemize

You can fine-tune the settings for these variables, or you can depend on the
defaults (in which case, you can skip this section).

There are two statements that affect the connection character sets:

@example
SET NAMES 'character_set_name'
SET CHARACTER SET character_set_name
@end example

@code{SET NAMES} indicates what is in the SQL statement that the client
sends. Thus, @code{SET NAMES 'cp1251'} tells the server ``future incoming
messages from this client will be in character set @code{cp1251}.'' It
also specifies the character set for results that the server sends back to
the client.  (For example, it indicates what character set column values
will have if you use a @code{SELECT} statement.)

A @code{SET NAMES 'x'} statement
is equivalent to these three statements:

@example
mysql> SET character_set_client = x;
mysql> SET character_set_results = x;
mysql> SET character_set_connection = x;
@end example

@code{SET CHARACTER SET} is similar but sets the connection character set
and collation to be those of the default database.  A @code{SET CHARACTER SET
x} statement is equivalent to these three statements:

@example
mysql> SET character_set_client = x;
mysql> SET character_set_results = x;
mysql> SET collation_connection = @@@@collation_database;
@end example

When a client connects, it sends to the server the name of the character set
that it wants to use. The server sets the @code{character_set_client},
@code{character_set_results}, and @code{character_set_connection} variables
to that character set. (In effect, the server performs a @code{SET NAMES}
operation using the character set.)

With the @code{mysql} client, it is not necessary to execute @code{SET NAMES}
every time you start up if you want to use a character set different from
the default. You can add the @code{--default-character-set}  option setting
to your @code{mysql} statement line, or in your option file.  For example,
the following option file setting changes the three character set variables
set to @code{koi8r} each time you run @code{mysql}:

@example
[mysql]
default-character-set=koi8r
@end example

Example: Suppose that @code{column1} is defined as @code{CHAR(5) CHARACTER
SET latin2}.  If you do not say @code{SET NAMES} or @code{SET CHARACTER SET},
then for @code{SELECT column1 FROM t}, the server will send back all the
values for @code{column1} using the character set that the client specified
when it connected. On the other hand, if you say @code{SET NAMES 'latin1'}
or @code{SET CHARACTER SET latin1}, then just before sending results back,
the server will convert the @code{latin2} values to @code{latin1}.
Conversion may be lossy if there are characters that are not in both
character sets.

If you do not want the server to perform any conversion, set
@code{character_set_results} to @code{NULL}:

@example
mysql> SET character_set_results = NULL;
@end example

@node Charset-literal, Charset-collate, Charset-connection, Charset-defaults
@subsection Character String Literal Character Set and Collation

Every character string literal has a character set and a collation,
which may not be null.

A character string literal may have an optional character set
introducer and @code{COLLATE} clause:

@cindex introducer, string literal
@cindex string literal introducer

@example
[_character_set_name]'string' [COLLATE collation_name]
@end example

Examples:
@example
SELECT 'string';
SELECT _latin1'string';
SELECT _latin1'string' COLLATE latin1_danish_ci;
@end example

For the simple statement @code{SELECT 'string'}, the string has the character
set and collation defined by the @code{character_set_connection} and
@code{collation_connection} system variables.

The @code{_character_set_name} expression is formally called
an @emph{introducer}. It tells the parser,
``the string that is about to follow is in character set @code{X}.''
Because this has confused people in the past, we emphasize
that an introducer does not cause any conversion, it is strictly a
signal that does not change the string's value. An introducer is
also legal before standard hex literal and numeric hex literal notation
(@code{x'literal'} and @code{0xnnnn}), and before @code{?} (parameter
substitution when using prepared statements within a programming language
interface).

Examples:

@example
SELECT _latin1 x'AABBCC';
SELECT _latin1 0xAABBCC;
SELECT _latin1 ?;
@end example

MySQL determines a literal's character set and collation thus:

@itemize @bullet
@item If both @code{_X} and @code{COLLATE Y} were specified, then
character set @code{X} and collation @code{Y}
@item If @code{_X} is specified but @code{COLLATE} is not specified, then
character set @code{X} and its default collation
@item Otherwise, the character set and collation given by the
@code{character_set_connection} and @code{collation_connection} system
variables

@end itemize

Examples:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A string with @code{latin1} character set and @code{latin1_german1_ci}
collation:

@example
SELECT _latin1'M@"uller' COLLATE latin1_german1_ci;
@end example

@item
A string with @code{latin1} character set and its default collation (that is,
@code{latin1_swedish_ci}):

@example
SELECT _latin1'M@"uller';
@end example

@item
A string with the connection default character set and collation:

@example
SELECT 'M@"uller';
@end example

@end itemize

Character set introducers and the @code{COLLATE} clause are implemented
according to standard SQL specifications.

@node Charset-collate, Charset-collate-precedence, Charset-literal, Charset-defaults
@subsection Using @code{COLLATE} in SQL Statements

With the @code{COLLATE} clause, you can override whatever the default
collation is for a comparison. @code{COLLATE} may be used in
various parts of SQL statements.  Here are some examples:

@itemize @bullet

@item With @code{ORDER BY}:

@example
SELECT k
FROM t1
ORDER BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
@end example

@item With @code{AS}:

@example
SELECT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci AS k1
FROM t1
ORDER BY k1;
@end example

@item With @code{GROUP BY}:

@example
SELECT k
FROM t1
GROUP BY k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
@end example

@item With aggregate functions:

@example
SELECT MAX(k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci)
FROM t1;
@end example

@item With @code{DISTINCT}:

@example
SELECT DISTINCT k COLLATE latin1_german2_ci
FROM t1;
@end example

@item With @code{WHERE}:

@example
SELECT *
FROM t1
WHERE _latin1 'M@"uller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci = k;
@end example

@item With @code{HAVING}:

@example
SELECT k
FROM t1
GROUP BY k
HAVING k = _latin1 'M@"uller' COLLATE latin1_german2_ci;
@end example

@end itemize

@node Charset-collate-precedence, Charset-binary-op, Charset-collate, Charset-defaults
@subsection @code{COLLATE} Clause Precedence

The @code{COLLATE} clause has high precedence (higher than @code{||}),
so the following two expressions are equivalent:

@example
x || y COLLATE z
x || (y COLLATE z)
@end example


@node Charset-binary-op, Charset-collate-tricky, Charset-collate-precedence, Charset-defaults
@subsection @code{BINARY} Operator

The @code{BINARY} operator is a shorthand for a @code{COLLATE} clause.
@code{BINARY 'x'} is equivalent to @code{'x' COLLATE y}, where @code{y} is
the name of the binary collation for the character set of @code{'x'}.  Every
character set has a binary collation.  For example, the binary collation for
the @code{latin1} character set is @code{latin1_bin}, so if the column
@code{a} is of character set @code{latin1}, the following two statements have
the same effect:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY BINARY a;
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a COLLATE latin1_bin;
@end example

@node Charset-collate-tricky, Charset-collation-charset, Charset-binary-op, Charset-defaults
@subsection Some Special Cases Where the Collation Determination Is Tricky

In the great majority of queries, it is obvious what collation
MySQL uses to resolve a comparison operation. For example, in the
following cases, it should be clear that the collation will be ``the
column collation of column @code{x}'':

@example
SELECT x FROM T ORDER BY x;
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = x;
SELECT DISTINCT x FROM T;
@end example

However, when multiple operands are involved, there can be
ambiguity. For example:

@example
SELECT x FROM T WHERE x = 'Y';
@end example

Should this query use the collation of the column @code{x}, or of the
string literal @code{'Y'}?

Standard SQL resolves such questions using what used to be
called ``coercibility'' rules. The essence is: Because @code{x} and @code{'Y'}
both have collations, whose collation takes precedence? It's complex,
but the following rules take care of most situations:

@itemize @bullet

@item An explicit @code{COLLATE} clause has a coercibility of 0.
(Not coercible at all.)

@item A concatenation of two strings with different collations has
a coercibility of 1.

@item A column's collation has a coercibility of 2.

@item A literal's collation has a coercibility of 3.

@end itemize

Those rules resolve ambiguities thus:

@itemize @bullet

@item Use the collation with the lowest coercibility value.

@item If both sides have the same coercibility, then it is an error if
the collations aren't the same.

@end itemize

Examples:

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5

@item @code{column1 = 'A'} @tab Use collation of @code{column1}
@item @code{column1 = 'A' COLLATE x} @tab Use collation of @code{'A'}
@item @code{column1 COLLATE x = 'A' COLLATE y} @tab Error

@end multitable

The @code{COERCIBILITY()} function can be used to determine the coercibility
of a string expression:

@example
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY('A' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci);
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY('A');
        -> 3
@end example

@xref{Information functions}.


@node Charset-collation-charset, Charset-collation-effect, Charset-collate-tricky, Charset-defaults
@subsection Collations Must Be for the Right Character Set

Recall that each character set has one or more
collations, and each collation is associated with one and only one
character set. Therefore, the following statement
causes an error message because the @code{latin2_bin} collation is not
legal with the @code{latin1} character set:

@example
mysql> SELECT _latin1 'x' COLLATE latin2_bin;
ERROR 1251: COLLATION 'latin2_bin' is not valid
for CHARACTER SET 'latin1'
@end example

In some cases, expressions that worked before MySQL 4.1 fail as of MySQL 4.1
if you do not take character set and collation into account. For example,
before 4.1, this statement works as is:

@example
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),'@@',1);
+-------------------------------+
| SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),'@@',1) |
+-------------------------------+
| root                          |
+-------------------------------+
@end example

After an upgrade to MySQL 4.1, the statement fails:

@example
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),'@@',1);
ERROR 1267 (HY000): Illegal mix of collations
(utf8_general_ci,IMPLICIT) and (latin1_swedish_ci,COERCIBLE)
for operation 'substr_index'
@end example

The reason this occurs is that usernames are stored using UTF8
(@pxref{Charset-metadata}). As a result, the @code{USER()} function and
the literal string @code{'@@'} have different character sets (and thus
different collations):

@example
mysql> SELECT COLLATION(USER()), COLLATION('@@');
+-------------------+-------------------+
| COLLATION(USER()) | COLLATION('@@')    |
+-------------------+-------------------+
| utf8_general_ci   | latin1_swedish_ci |
+-------------------+-------------------+
@end example

One way to deal with this is to tell MySQL to interpret the literal
string as @code{utf8}:

@example
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),_utf8'@@',1);
+------------------------------------+
| SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),_utf8'@@',1) |
+------------------------------------+
| root                               |
+------------------------------------+
@end example

Another way is to change the connection character set and collation to
@code{utf8}. You can do that with @code{SET NAMES 'utf8'} or by setting
the @code{character_set_connection} and @code{collation_connection} system
variables directly.


@node Charset-collation-effect,  , Charset-collation-charset, Charset-defaults
@subsection An Example of the Effect of Collation

Suppose that column @code{X} in table @code{T} has these @code{latin1} column values:

@example
Muffler
M@"uller
MX Systems
MySQL
@end example

And suppose that the column values are retrieved using the following
statement:

@example
SELECT X FROM T ORDER BY X COLLATE collation_name;
@end example

The resulting order of the values for different collations is shown in this
table:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .30 .30
@item @code{latin1_swedish_ci} @tab @code{latin1_german1_ci} @tab @code{latin1_german2_ci}
@item Muffler @tab Muffler @tab M@"uller
@item MX Systems @tab M@"uller @tab Muffler
@item M@"uller @tab MX Systems @tab MX Systems
@item MySQL @tab MySQL @tab MySQL
@end multitable

The table is an example that shows what the effect would
be if we used different collations in an @code{ORDER BY} clause. The
character that causes the different sort orders in this example is the U with
two dots over it, which the Germans call U-umlaut, but we'll call
it U-diaeresis.

@itemize @bullet

@item
The first column shows the result of the @code{SELECT} using the
Swedish/Finnish collating rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts
with Y.

@item
The second column shows the result of the @code{SELECT} using the
German DIN-1 rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts with U.

@item
The third column shows the result of the @code{SELECT} using the German
DIN-2 rule, which says that U-diaeresis sorts with UE.

@end itemize

Three different collations, three different results. That's what
MySQL is here to handle. By using the appropriate collation, you can choose
the sort order you want.

This section describes operations that take character set information
into account as of MySQL 4.1.

@node Charset-result, Charset-CONVERT, Charset-operations, Charset-operations
@subsection Result Strings

MySQL has many operators and functions that return a string.
This section answers the question: What is the character set
and collation of such a string?

For simple functions that take string input and return a string result as
output, the output's character set and collation are the same as those of
the principal input value. For example, @code{UPPER(X)} returns a string
whose character string and collation are the same as that of @code{X}.
The same applies for
@code{INSTR()},
@code{LCASE()},
@code{LOWER()},
@code{LTRIM()},
@code{MID()},
@code{REPEAT()},
@code{REPLACE()},
@code{REVERSE()},
@code{RIGHT()},
@code{RPAD()},
@code{RTRIM()},
@code{SOUNDEX()},
@code{SUBSTRING()},
@code{TRIM()},
@code{UCASE()}, and
@code{UPPER()}.
(Also note: The @code{REPLACE()} function, unlike all other functions,
ignores the collation of the string input and performs a
case-insensitive comparison every time.)

For operations that combine multiple string inputs and return a
single string output, the ``aggregation rules'' of standard SQL apply:

@itemize @bullet
@item If an explicit @code{COLLATE X} occurs, then use @code{X}
@item If an explicit @code{COLLATE X} and @code{COLLATE Y} occur, then error
@item Otherwise, if all collations are @code{X}, then use @code{X}
@item Otherwise, the result has no collation

@end itemize

For example, with @code{CASE ... WHEN a THEN b WHEN b THEN c COLLATE X
END}, the resultant collation is @code{X}. The same applies for
@code{CASE},
@code{UNION},
@code{||},
@code{CONCAT()},
@code{ELT()},
@code{GREATEST()},
@code{IF()}, and
@code{LEAST()}.

For operations that convert to character data, the character set and
collation of the strings that result from the operations are defined by the
@code{character_set_connection} and @code{collation_connection} system
variables.  This applies for
@code{CAST()},
@code{CHAR()},
@code{CONV()},
@code{FORMAT()},
@code{HEX()}, and
@code{SPACE()}.

@node Charset-CONVERT, Charset-CAST, Charset-result, Charset-operations
@subsection @code{CONVERT()}

@code{CONVERT()} provides a way to convert data between different
character sets. The syntax is:

@example
CONVERT(expression USING transcoding_name)
@end example

In MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the
corresponding character set names.

Examples:

@example
SELECT CONVERT(_latin1'M@"uller' USING utf8);
INSERT INTO utf8table (utf8column)
    SELECT CONVERT(latin1field USING utf8) FROM latin1table;
@end example

@code{CONVERT(... USING ...)} is implemented according to the standard SQL
specification.

@node Charset-CAST, Charset-SHOW, Charset-CONVERT, Charset-operations
@subsection @code{CAST()}

You may also use @code{CAST()} to convert a string to a different character
set. The syntax is:

@example
CAST( character_string AS character_data_type
    CHARACTER SET character_set_name )
@end example

Example:

@example
SELECT CAST(_latin1'test' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8);
@end example

If you use @code{CAST()} without specifying @code{CHARACTER SET},
the resulting character set and collation are defined by the
@code{character_set_connection} and @code{collation_connection} system
variables.  If you use @code{CAST()} with @code{CHARACTER SET X}, then
the resulting character set and collation are @code{X} and the default
collation of @code{X}.

You may not use a @code{COLLATE} clause inside a @code{CAST()}, but you may use
it outside. That is, @code{CAST(... COLLATE ...)} is illegal, but
@code{CAST(...) COLLATE ...} is legal.

Example:

@example
SELECT CAST(_latin1'test' AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8) COLLATE utf8_bin;
@end example


@node Charset-SHOW,  , Charset-CAST, Charset-operations
@subsection @code{SHOW} Statements

Several @code{SHOW} statements are new or modified in MySQL 4.1 to provide
additional character set information.
@code{SHOW CHARACTER SET},
@code{SHOW COLLATION}, and
@code{SHOW CREATE DATABASE} are new.
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} and
@code{SHOW COLUMNS} are modified.

The @code{SHOW CHARACTER SET} command shows all available character sets.
It takes an optional @code{LIKE} clause that indicates which character set
names to match.  For example:

@example
mysql> SHOW CHARACTER SET LIKE 'latin%';
+---------+-----------------------------+-------------------+--------+
| Charset | Description                 | Default collation | Maxlen |
+---------+-----------------------------+-------------------+--------+
| latin1  | ISO 8859-1 West European    | latin1_swedish_ci |      1 |
| latin2  | ISO 8859-2 Central European | latin2_general_ci |      1 |
| latin5  | ISO 8859-9 Turkish          | latin5_turkish_ci |      1 |
| latin7  | ISO 8859-13 Baltic          | latin7_general_ci |      1 |
+---------+-----------------------------+-------------------+--------+
@end example

@xref{SHOW CHARACTER SET,  , @code{SHOW CHARACTER SET}}.

The output from @code{SHOW COLLATION} includes all available character
sets.
It takes an optional @code{LIKE} clause that indicates which collation
names to match.  For example:

@example
mysql> SHOW COLLATION LIKE 'latin1%';
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| Collation         | Charset | Id | Default | Compiled | Sortlen |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
| latin1_german1_ci | latin1  |  5 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_swedish_ci | latin1  |  8 | Yes     | Yes      |       0 |
| latin1_danish_ci  | latin1  | 15 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_german2_ci | latin1  | 31 |         | Yes      |       2 |
| latin1_bin        | latin1  | 47 |         | Yes      |       0 |
| latin1_general_ci | latin1  | 48 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_general_cs | latin1  | 49 |         |          |       0 |
| latin1_spanish_ci | latin1  | 94 |         |          |       0 |
+-------------------+---------+----+---------+----------+---------+
@end example

@xref{SHOW COLLATION,  , @code{SHOW COLLATION}}.

@code{SHOW CREATE DATABASE} displays the @code{CREATE DATABASE} statement
that will create a given database. The result includes all database
options. @code{DEFAULT CHARACTER SET} and @code{COLLATE} are supported. All
database options are stored in a text file named @file{db.opt} that can
be found in the database directory.

@example
mysql> SHOW CREATE DATABASE a\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Database: a
Create Database: CREATE DATABASE `a`
                 /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET macce */
@end example

@xref{SHOW CREATE DATABASE,  , @code{SHOW CREATE DATABASE}}.

@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} is similar, but displays the @code{CREATE TABLE}
statement to create a given table. The column definitions now indicate any
character set specifications, and the table options include character set
information.

@xref{SHOW CREATE TABLE,  , @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}}.

The @code{SHOW COLUMNS} statement displays the collations of a table's
columns when invoked as @code{SHOW FULL COLUMNS}.
Columns with @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, or @code{TEXT} data types have
non-@code{NULL} collations. Numeric and other non-character types have
@code{NULL} collations. For example:

@example
mysql> SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM t;
+-------+---------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type    | Collation  | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+---------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| a     | char(1) | latin1_bin | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| b     | int(11) | NULL       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+---------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
@end example

The character set is not part of the display. (The character set name is implied by
the collation name.)

@xref{SHOW COLUMNS,  , @code{SHOW COLUMNS}}.

@node Charset-Unicode, Charset-metadata, Charset-operations, Charset
@section Unicode Support

There are two new (as of MySQL version 4.1) character sets for storing 
Unicode data:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{ucs2}, the UCS-2 Unicode character set.
@item
@code{utf8}, the UTF8 encoding of the Unicode character set.
@end itemize

In UCS-2 (binary Unicode representation), every character is
represented by a two-byte Unicode code with the most significant
byte first. For example: "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" has the code
0x0041 and it's stored as a two-byte sequence: 0x00 0x41. "CYRILLIC
SMALL LETTER YERU" (Unicode 0x044B) is stored as a two-byte
sequence: 0x04 0x4B. For Unicode characters and their codes, please
refer to the @uref{http://www.unicode.org/,Unicode Home Page}.

A temporary restriction is that UCS-2 cannot yet be used as a client
character set. That means that @code{SET NAMES 'ucs2'} will not work.

The UTF8 character set (transform Unicode representation) is an
alternative way to store Unicode data. It is implemented according
to RFC2279. The idea of the UTF8 character set is that various
Unicode characters fit into byte sequences of different
lengths:

@itemize @bullet
@item Basic Latin letters, digits, and punctuation signs use one
byte.
@item Most European and Middle East script letters fit into a two-byte
sequence: extended Latin letters (with tilde, macron, acute,
grave and other accents), Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, Hebrew,
Arabic, Syriac, and others.
@item Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs use three-byte
sequences.

@end itemize

Currently, MySQL UTF8 support does not include four-byte sequences.

Tip: To save space with UTF8, use @code{VARCHAR} instead of @code{CHAR}.
Otherwise, MySQL has to reserve 30 bytes for a @code{CHAR(10) CHARACTER
SET utf8} column, because that's the maximum possible length.


@node Charset-metadata, Charset-compatibility, Charset-Unicode, Charset
@section UTF8 for Metadata

The metadata is the data about the data. Anything that
describes the database, as opposed to being the contents of the
database, is metadata. Thus column names, database names,
usernames, version names, and most of the string results from @code{SHOW} are
metadata.

Representation of metadata must satisfy these requirements:

@itemize @bullet

@item
All metadata must be in the same character set. Otherwise, @code{SHOW}
wouldn't work properly because different rows in the same column would be
in different character sets.

@item
Metadata must include all characters in all languages. Otherwise, users
wouldn't be able to name columns and tables in their own languages.

@end itemize

In order to satisfy both requirements, MySQL stores metadata in a Unicode
character set, namely UTF8. This will not cause any disruption if you never
use accented characters. But if you do, you should be aware that metadata
is in UTF8.

This means that the @code{USER()}, @code{CURRENT_USER()}, and @code{VERSION()}
functions will have the UTF8 character set by default.  So will any
synonyms, such the @code{SESSION_USER()} and @code{SYSTEM_USER()} synonyms
for @code{USER()}.

The server sets the @code{character_set_system} system variable to the
name of the metadata character set:

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_system';
+----------------------+-------+
| Variable_name        | Value |
+----------------------+-------+
| character_set_system | utf8  |
+----------------------+-------+
@end example

Storage of metadata using Unicode does @emph{not} mean that the headers
of columns and the results of @code{DESCRIBE} functions will be in the
@code{character_set_system} character set by default.  When you say
@code{SELECT column1 FROM t}, the name @code{column1} itself will be
returned from the server to the client in the character set as determined
by the @code{SET NAMES} statement. More specifically, the character
set used is determined by the value of the @code{character_set_results}
system variable. If this variable is set to @code{NULL}, no conversion is
performed and the server returns metadata using its original character set
(the set indicated by @code{character_set_system}).

If you want the server to pass metadata results back in a
non-UTF8 character set, then use @code{SET NAMES} to force the
server to perform character set conversion (@pxref{Charset-connection}),
or else set the client to do the conversion. It is
always more efficient to set the client to do the conversion, but
this option will not be available for many clients until late in
the MySQL 4.x product cycle.

If you are just using, for example, the @code{USER()} function for
comparison or assignment within a single statement, don't worry.
MySQL will do some automatic conversion for you.

@example
SELECT * FROM Table1 WHERE USER() = latin1_column;
@end example

This will work because the contents of @code{latin1_column} are
automatically converted to UTF8 before the comparison.

@example
INSERT INTO Table1 (latin1_column) SELECT USER();
@end example

This will work because the contents of @code{USER()} are automatically
converted to @code{latin1} before the assignment.
Automatic conversion is not fully implemented yet, but should work
correctly in a later version.


Although automatic conversion is not in the SQL standard, the
SQL standard document does say that every character set is (in
terms of supported characters) a ``subset'' of Unicode. Since it is a
well-known principle that ``what applies to a superset can apply to
a subset,'' we believe that a collation for Unicode can apply for
comparisons with non-Unicode strings.


@c VERSION 4.1.1 NOTE: The @file{errmsg.txt} files will all be in UTF8
@c after this point. Conversion to the client character set will be
@c automatic, as for metadata. Also: We may change the default
@c behavior for passing back result set metadata in the near
@c future.

@section Compatibility with Other DBMSs

For SAP DB compatibility these two statements are the same:

@node Charset-config-file, Charset-national, Charset-compatibility, Charset
@section New Character Set Configuration File Format

In MySQL 4.1, character set configuration is stored in XML
files, one file per character set. In previous versions, this information
was stored in @file{.conf} files.

@node Charset-national, Charset-upgrading, Charset-config-file, Charset
@section National Character Set

Before MySQL 4.1, @code{NCHAR} and @code{CHAR} were synonymous. ANSI
defines @code{NCHAR} or @code{NATIONAL CHAR} as a way to define that a
@code{CHAR}
column should use some predefined character set. MySQL 4.1 and up uses @code{utf8} as
that predefined character set. For example, these column type declarations
are equivalent:

@example
CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL CHARACTER(10)
NCHAR(10)
@end example

As are these:

@example
VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL VARCHAR(10)
NCHAR VARCHAR(10)
NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(10)
NATIONAL CHAR VARYING(10)
@end example

You can use @code{N'literal'} to create a string in
the national character set.
These two statements are equivalent:

@example
SELECT N'some text';
SELECT _utf8'some text';
@end example

* Charset-conversion::          Converting 4.0 Character Columns to 4.1 Format
@end menu

Now, what about upgrading from older versions of MySQL? MySQL 4.1
is almost upward compatible with MySQL 4.0 and earlier for the
simple reason that almost all the features are new, so there's
nothing in earlier versions to conflict with. However, there are
some differences and a few things to be aware of.

Most important: The ``MySQL 4.0 character set'' has the properties
of both ``MySQL 4.1 character sets'' and ``MySQL 4.1 collations.'' You
will have to unlearn this. Henceforth, we will not bundle character
set/collation properties in the same conglomerate object.

There is a special treatment of national character sets in MySQL
4.1. @code{NCHAR} is not the same as @code{CHAR}, and @code{N'...'} literals
are not the same as @code{'...'} literals.

Finally, there is a different file format for storing information
about character sets and collations. Make sure that you have reinstalled the
@file{/share/mysql/charsets/} directory containing the new configuration files.

If you want to start @code{mysqld} from a 4.1.x distribution with data
created by MySQL 4.0, you should start the server with the same
character set and collation. In this case you won't need to reindex
your data.

There are two ways to do so:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-charset=... --with-collation=...
shell> ./mysqld --default-character-set=... --default-collation=...
@end example

If you used @code{mysqld} with, for example, the MySQL 4.0 @code{danish}
character set, you should now use the @code{latin1} character set and
the @code{latin1_danish_ci} collation:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-charset=latin1 \
           --with-collation=latin1_danish_ci
shell> ./mysqld --default-character-set=latin1 \
           --default-collation=latin1_danish_ci
@end example

Use the table shown in @ref{Charset-map} to find old 4.0 character set
names and their 4.1 character set/collation pair equivalents.

If you have non-@code{latin1} data stored in a 4.0 @code{latin1} table
and want to convert the table column definitions to reflect the actual
character set of the data, use the instructions in @ref{Charset-conversion}.

@subsection Converting 4.0 Character Columns to 4.1 Format

Normally, the server runs using the @code{latin1} character set by default.
If you have been storing column data that actually is in some other
character set that the 4.1 server now supports directly, you can convert the
column.  However, you should avoid trying to convert directly from
@code{latin1} to the "real" character set. This may result in data loss.
Instead, convert the column to a binary column type, and then from the
binary type to a non-binary type with the desired character set.  Conversion
to and from binary involves no attempt at character value conversion and
preserves your data intact.  For example, suppose that you have a 4.0 table with
three columns that are used to store values represented in @code{latin1},
@code{latin2}, and @code{utf8}:

@example
CREATE TABLE t
(
    latin1_col CHAR(50),
    latin2_col CHAR(100),
    utf8_col CHAR(150)
);
@end example

After upgrading to MySQL 4.1, you want to convert this table to leave
@code{latin1_col} alone but change the @code{latin2_col} and @code{utf8_col}
columns to have character sets of @code{latin2} and @code{utf8}.  First,
back up your table, then convert the columns as follows:

@example
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY latin2_col BINARY(100);
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY utf8_col BINARY(150);
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY latin2_col CHAR(100) CHARACTER SET latin2;
ALTER TABLE t MODIFY utf8_col CHAR(150) CHARACTER SET utf8;
@end example

The first two statements ``remove'' the character set information from the
@code{latin2_col} and @code{utf8_col} columns.  The second two statements
assign the proper character sets to the two columns.

If you like, you can combine the to-binary conversions and from-binary
conversions into single statements:

@example
ALTER TABLE t
    MODIFY latin2_col BINARY(100),
    MODIFY utf8_col BINARY(150);
ALTER TABLE t
    MODIFY latin2_col CHAR(100) CHARACTER SET latin2,
    MODIFY utf8_col CHAR(150) CHARACTER SET utf8;

Here is an annotated list of character sets and collations that
MySQL supports. Because options and installation settings differ,
some sites might not have all items listed, and some sites might
have items not listed.

MySQL supports 70+ collations for 30+ character sets. The character sets and
their default collations are displayed by the
@code{SHOW CHARACTER SET STATEMENT}.
(The output actually includes another column that is not shown so that the
example fits better on the page.)

@c NOTE: If you rerun the following command, trim off the Maxlen column.
@c Otherwise, the lines are too long to fit nicely on the page.

@subsection Unicode Character Sets

MySQL has two Unicode character sets. You can store
texts in about 650 languages using these character sets. We have
not added a large number of collations for these two new sets yet,
but that will be happening soon. Currently, they have default
case-insensitive accent-insensitive collations, plus the binary
collation.

Currently, the @code{ucs2_general_uca} collation has only partial support
for the Unicode Collation Algorithm. Some characters are not supported yet.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{ucs2} (UCS-2 Unicode) collations:
@itemize

@subsection West European Character Sets

West European Character Sets cover most West European languages,
such as French, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Italian,
Albanian, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish,
Faroese, Icelandic, Irish, Scottish, and English.

@item @code{latin1_german2_ci}
@item @code{latin1_spanish_ci}
@item @code{latin1_swedish_ci} (default)
@end itemize

The @code{latin1} is the default character set.
The @code{latin1_swedish_ci} collation is the default that probably is
used by the majority of MySQL customers. It is constantly stated
that this is based on the Swedish/Finnish collation rules, but you
will find Swedes and Finns who disagree with that statement.

The @code{latin1_german1_ci} and @code{latin1_german2_ci}
collations are based on the DIN-1 and DIN-2 standards,
where DIN stands for Deutsches Institut f@"ur Normung (that is,
the German answer to ANSI).
DIN-1 is called the dictionary collation and DIN-2 is called the
phone-book collation.

@itemize @bullet

@item @code{latin1_german1_ci} (dictionary) rules:

@samp{@"A} = @samp{A}, @samp{@"O} = @samp{O}, @samp{@"U} = @samp{U}, @samp{@ss{}} = @samp{s}

@c help_category Column Types

MySQL supports a number of column types that may be grouped into
several categories: numeric types, date and time types, and string (character)
types.  This chapter first gives an overview of these column types,
and then provides a
more detailed description of the properties of the types in each category.
The overview is intentionally brief.  The more detailed descriptions should
be consulted for additional information about particular column types, such
as the allowable formats in which you can specify values.

In addition, MySQL 4.1 and up supports extensions for handing spatial
data.  Information about spatial types is provided in
@ref{Spatial extensions in MySQL}.

@cindex data types
@cindex types, data
@cindex columns, types
@cindex types, columns

The column types supported by MySQL follow.
Several of the type descriptions use these conventions:

@table @code
@item M
@cindex display size
@cindex sizes, display
Indicates the maximum display size.  The maximum legal display size is 255.

@item D
@cindex digits
@cindex decimal point
Applies to floating-point and fixed-point types and indicates the number of
digits following the decimal point.  The maximum possible value is 30, but
should be no greater than @code{M}-2.

@end table

@cindex brackets, square
@cindex square brackets
Square brackets (@samp{[} and @samp{]}) indicate parts of type specifiers
that are optional.

@tindex Types

@c The @w{-number} stuff keeps a linebreak from occurring between
@c the - and number.

Note that if you specify @code{ZEROFILL} for a column, MySQL
automatically adds the @code{UNSIGNED} attribute to the column.

@strong{Warning:} You should be aware that when you use subtraction
between integer values where one is of type @code{UNSIGNED}, the result
will be unsigned! @xref{Cast Functions}.

@c end_description_for_help_topic
Some things you should be aware of with respect to @code{BIGINT} columns:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@cindex rounding errors
All arithmetic is done using signed @code{BIGINT} or @code{DOUBLE}
values, so you shouldn't use unsigned big integers larger than
@code{9223372036854775807} (63 bits) except with bit functions! If you
do that, some of the last digits in the result may be wrong because of
rounding errors when converting a @code{BIGINT} value to a @code{DOUBLE}.

MySQL 4.0 can handle @code{BIGINT} in the following cases:

@itemize @bullet
@item
When using integers to store big unsigned values in a @code{BIGINT} column.
@item
In @code{MIN(col_name)} and @code{MAX(col_name)}, where @code{col_name} refers
to a @code{BIGINT} column.
@item
When using operators (@code{+}, @code{-}, @code{*}, and so on) where
both operands are integers.
@end itemize

@item
You can always store an exact integer value in a @code{BIGINT} column by
storing it using a string.  In this case, MySQL performs a string-to-number
conversion that involves no intermediate double representation.
@item
@samp{-}, @samp{+}, and @samp{*} will use @code{BIGINT} arithmetic when
both arguments are integer values!  This means that if you
multiply two big integers (or results from functions that return
integers) you may get unexpected results when the result is larger than
@code{9223372036854775807}.
@end itemize

@cindex floating-point number
@tindex FLOAT
@tindex FLOAT(precision)
@c description_for_help_topic FLOAT  UNSIGNED ZEROFILL FLOAT4
@item FLOAT(precision) [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]

A floating-point number.  @code{precision} can be from 0 to
24 for a single-precision floating-point number and from 25
to 53 for a double-precision floating-point number. These types are like
the @code{FLOAT} and @code{DOUBLE} types described immediately following.
@code{FLOAT(precision)} has the same range as the corresponding @code{FLOAT} and
@code{DOUBLE} types, but the display size and number of decimals are undefined.

As of MySQL Version 3.23, this is a true floating-point value.  In
earlier MySQL versions, @code{FLOAT(precision)} always has 2 decimals.

Note that using @code{FLOAT} might give you some unexpected problems because
all calculations in MySQL are done with double precision.
@xref{No matching rows}.

@cindex ODBC compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with ODBC
This syntax is provided for ODBC compatibility.

@tindex FLOAT

A small (single-precision) floating-point number.  Allowable values are
@code{@w{-3.402823466E+38}} to @code{@w{-1.175494351E-38}}, @code{0},

using one character for each digit of the value.  The decimal point and
(for negative numbers) the @samp{-} sign are not counted in @code{M}, although
space for them is reserved. If @code{D} is 0, values have no decimal
point or fractional part.  The maximum range of @code{DECIMAL} values is
the same as for @code{DOUBLE}, but the actual range for a given
@code{DECIMAL} column may be constrained by the choice of @code{M} and
@code{D}.  If @code{UNSIGNED} is specified, negative values are disallowed.  

If @code{D} is omitted, the default is 0.  If @code{M} is omitted, the

A timestamp.  The range is @code{'1970-01-01 00:00:00'} to sometime in the
year @code{2037}.

A @code{TIMESTAMP} column is useful for recording the date and time of an
@code{INSERT} or @code{UPDATE} operation. The first @code{TIMESTAMP} column
in a table is automatically set to the date and time of the most recent
operation if you don't assign it a value yourself.  You can also set any
@code{TIMESTAMP} column to the current date and time by assigning it a
@code{NULL} value.
@xref{Date and time types}.

From MySQL 4.1 on, @code{TIMESTAMP} is returned as a string with the format
@code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'}. If you want to obtain the value as a number, you
should add +0 to the timestamp column. Different timestamp display widths are
not supported.

In MySQL 4.0 and earlier, @code{TIMESTAMP} values are displayed in
@code{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}, @code{YYMMDDHHMMSS}, @code{YYYYMMDD}, or @code{YYMMDD}
format, depending on whether @code{M} is 14 (or missing), 12,
8, or 6, but allows you to assign values to @code{TIMESTAMP}
columns using either strings or numbers.
The @code{M} argument affects only how a @code{TIMESTAMP} column is displayed,
not storage.  its values always are stored using 4 bytes each.
From version 4.0.12, the @code{--new} option can be used
to make the server behave as in version 4.1.

Note that @code{TIMESTAMP(M)} columns where @code{M} is 8 or 14 are reported to
be numbers, whereas other @code{TIMESTAMP(M)} columns are reported to be
strings.  This is just to ensure that you can reliably dump and restore

A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to the

From version 4.1.0, a @code{CHAR} column with a length specification greater
than 255 is converted to the smallest @code{TEXT} type that can hold values
of the given length.  For example, @code{CHAR(500)} is converted to
@code{TEXT}, and @code{CHAR(200000)} is converted to @code{MEDIUMTEXT}.
This is a compatibility feature.  Note that this conversion causes the
column to become a variable-length column.

@code{CHAR} is shorthand for @code{CHARACTER}.
@code{NATIONAL CHAR} (or its equivalent short form, @code{NCHAR}) is the
standard SQL way to define that a @code{CHAR} column should use the default
character set.  This is the default in MySQL.

From version 4.1.0 on, the @code{ASCII} attribute can be specified. It
assigns the @code{latin1} character set to a @code{CHAR} column.

From version 4.1.1, the @code{UNICODE} attribute can be specified. It
assigns the @code{ucs2} character set to a @code{CHAR} column.

MySQL allows you to create a column of type @code{CHAR(0)}. This is mainly
useful when you have to be compliant with some old applications that depend
on the existence of a column but that do not actually use the value.  This
is also quite nice when you need a column that can take only two values: A
@code{CHAR(0)} column that is not defined as @code{NOT NULL} occupies only
one bit and can take only the values @code{NULL} and @code{''} (the empty

MySQL supports all of the standard SQL numeric data types.  These
types include the exact numeric data types (@code{INTEGER},
@code{SMALLINT}, @code{DECIMAL}, and @code{NUMERIC}), as well as the
approximate numeric data types (@code{FLOAT}, @code{REAL}, and
@code{DOUBLE PRECISION}). The keyword @code{INT} is a synonym for
@code{INTEGER}, and the keyword @code{DEC} is a synonym for
@code{DECIMAL}.

As an extension to the SQL standard, MySQL also supports the integer
types @code{TINYINT}, @code{MEDIUMINT}, and @code{BIGINT} as listed in
the following table.

@end multitable

Another extension is supported by MySQL for optionally
specifying the display width of an integer value in parentheses following
the base keyword for the type (for example, @code{INT(4)}).  This optional
display width specification is used to left-pad the display of values
having a width less than the width specified for the column. However, the
display width does not constrain the range of values that can be stored
in the column, or the number of digits that will be displayed for values
having a width exceeding that specified for the column.

When used in conjunction with the optional extension attribute
@code{ZEROFILL}, the default padding of spaces is replaced with zeros.
For example, for a column declared as @code{INT(5) ZEROFILL}, a value
of @code{4} is retrieved as @code{00004}.  Note that if you store larger
values than the display width in an integer column, you may experience
problems when MySQL generates temporary tables for some
complicated joins, as in these cases MySQL trusts that the
data did fit into the original column width.

All integer types can have an optional (non-standard) attribute
@code{UNSIGNED}.  Unsigned values can be used when you want to allow only
non-negative numbers in a column and you need a little bigger upper numeric
range for the column.

As of MySQL 4.0.2, floating-point and fixed-point types also can be
@code{UNSIGNED}.  As with integer types, this attribute prevents negative
values from being stored in the column.  However, unlike the integer types,
the upper range of column values remains the same.

The @code{DECIMAL} and @code{NUMERIC} types are implemented as the same
type by MySQL.  They are
used to store values for which it is important to preserve exact precision,
for example with monetary data.  When declaring a column of one of these
types the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified; for
example:

@example
salary DECIMAL(5,2)
@end example

In this example, @code{5} is the precision and @code{2} is the scale.  The
precision represents the number of significant decimal digits that will be
stored for values, and the scale represents the number of digits that will
be stored following the decimal point.

MySQL stores @code{DECIMAL} and @code{NUMERIC} values as strings, rather
than as binary floating-point numbers, in order to preserve the decimal
precision of those values.  One character is used for each digit of the
value, the decimal point (if the scale is greater than 0), and the @samp{-} sign
(for negative numbers).  If the scale is 0, @code{DECIMAL} and
@code{NUMERIC} values contain no decimal point or fractional part.

Standard SQL requires that the @code{salary} column
be able to store any value with 5 digits and 2 decimals. In this case,
therefore, the range of values that can be stored in the @code{salary}
column is from @code{-999.99} to @code{999.99}.  MySQL varies from this in
two ways:

@itemize @bullet

@item
On the positive end of the range, MySQL actually can store numbers up to
@code{9999.99} in this column. For positive numbers, it uses the
byte reserved for the sign to extend the upper end of the range.

@item
@code{DECIMAL} columns in MySQL before 3.23 are stored differently and
cannot represent all the values required by standard SQL. This is because
for a type of @code{DECIMAL(M,D)}, the value of @code{M} includes the bytes
for the sign and the decimal point.  The range of the @code{salary} column
before MySQL 3.23 would be @code{-9.99} to @code{99.99}.

@end itemize

In standard SQL, the syntax @code{DECIMAL(p)} is equivalent to
@code{DECIMAL(p,0)}.  Similarly, the syntax @code{DECIMAL} is equivalent
to @code{DECIMAL(p,0)}, where the implementation is allowed to decide
the value of @code{p}.  As of MySQL 3.23.6, both of these variant forms of
the @code{DECIMAL}/@code{NUMERIC} data types are supported.  Before 3.23.6,
the precision and scale both must be specified explicitly.

The maximum range of @code{DECIMAL} and @code{NUMERIC} values is the
same as for @code{DOUBLE}, but the actual range for a given
@code{DECIMAL} or @code{NUMERIC} column can be constrained by the
precision or scale for a given column.  When such a column
is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than
are allowed by the specified scale, the value is converted to that
scale.  (The precise behavior is operating system-specific, but
generally the effect is truncation to the allowable number of digits.)
When a @code{DECIMAL} or @code{NUMERIC} column is
assigned a value that exceeds the range implied by the
specified (or default) precision and scale,
MySQL stores the value representing the corresponding end
point of that range.

For floating-point column types, MySQL uses four bytes for single-precision
values and eight bytes for double-precision values.

The @code{FLOAT} type is used to represent approximate numeric data types.
The SQL standard allows an optional specification of the precision
(but not the range of the exponent) in bits following the keyword
@code{FLOAT} in parentheses.  The MySQL implementation also supports this
optional precision specification, but the precision value is used only to
determine storage size.  A precision from 0 to 23 results in four-byte
single-precision @code{FLOAT} column. A precision from 24 to 53 results
in eight-byte double-precision @code{DOUBLE} column.

When the keyword
@code{FLOAT} is used for a column type without a precision specification,
MySQL uses four bytes to store the values.  MySQL also supports variant
syntax with two numbers given in parentheses following the @code{FLOAT}
keyword.  The first number represents the display width
and the second number specifies the number of digits to be stored and
displayed following the decimal point (as with @code{DECIMAL} and
@code{NUMERIC}).  When MySQL is asked to store a number for
such a column with more decimal digits following the decimal point than
specified for the column, the value is rounded to eliminate the extra
digits when the value is stored.

In standard SQL, the @code{REAL} and @code{DOUBLE PRECISION} types do not accept
precision specifications.  MySQL supports a variant syntax with two numbers
given in parentheses following the type name.  The first number represents
the display width and the second number specifies the number of digits to
be stored and displayed following the decimal point.
As an extension to the SQL standard, MySQL recognizes @code{DOUBLE}
as a synonym for the @code{DOUBLE PRECISION} type.  In contrast with the
standard's requirement that the precision for @code{REAL} be smaller than
that used for @code{DOUBLE PRECISION}, MySQL implements both as 8-byte
double-precision floating-point values (when the server SQL mode does not
include the @code{REAL_AS_FLOAT} option).

For maximum portability, code requiring storage of approximate numeric
data values should use @code{FLOAT} or @code{DOUBLE PRECISION} with no
specification of precision or number of decimal points.

When asked to store a value in a numeric column that is outside the column
type's allowable range, MySQL clips the value to the appropriate
endpoint of the range and stores the resulting value instead.

For example, the range of an @code{INT} column is @code{-2147483648}
to @code{2147483647}.  If you try to insert @code{-9999999999} into an
@code{INT} column, MySQL clips the value to the lower endpoint of the
range and stores @code{-2147483648} instead. Similarly, if you try to
insert @code{9999999999}, MySQL clips the value to the upper endpoint of
the range and stores @code{2147483647} instead.

If the @code{INT} column is @code{UNSIGNED}, the size of the column's
range is the same but its endpoints shift up to @code{0} and @code{4294967295}.
If you try to store @code{-9999999999} and @code{9999999999},
the values stored in the column are @code{0} and @code{4294967296}.

Conversions that occur due to clipping are reported as ``warnings'' for
@code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}, @code{UPDATE}, and
multiple-row @code{INSERT} statements.

The date and time types for representing temporal values are @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE},
@code{TIMESTAMP}, @code{TIME}, and @code{YEAR}.  Each temporal type has a
range of legal values, as well as a ``zero'' value that is used when you
specify an illegal value that MySQL cannot represent.

MySQL allows you to store certain ``not strictly legal'' date values,
such as @code{'1999-11-31'}.  The reason for this is that we consider date
checking to be the responsibility of the application, not the SQL server.
To make date checking faster, MySQL verifies only that the month is in the
range from 0 to 12 and that the day is in the range from 0 to 31. These ranges
are defined to include zero because MySQL allows you to store dates where the
day or month and day are zero in a @code{DATE} or @code{DATETIME} column.
This is extremely useful for applications that need to store a birthdate
for which you don't know the exact date. In this case, you simply store
the date like @code{'1999-00-00'} or @code{'1999-01-00'}.  Note that if you
store dates like these, you should not expect to get correct results for
such as @code{DATE_SUB()} or @code{DATE_ADD} that require complete dates.

Here are some general considerations to keep in mind when working
with date and time types:

@itemize @bullet
@item
MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a standard output
format, but it attempts to interpret a variety of formats for input values
that you supply (for example, when you specify a value to be assigned to
or compared to a date or time type).  Only the formats described in the
following sections are supported.  It is expected that you will supply
legal values, and unpredictable results may occur if you use values in
other formats.

@item
Dates containing two-digit year values are ambiguous because the century is
unknown.  MySQL interprets two-digit year values using the following
rules:

@itemize @minus
@item
Year values in the range @code{00-69} are converted to @code{2000-2069}.

@item
Year values in the range @code{70-99} are converted to @code{1970-1999}.
@end itemize

@item
Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats, 
dates always must be
given in year-month-day order (for example, @code{'98-09-04'}), rather than
in the month-day-year or day-month-year orders commonly used elsewhere (for
example, @code{'09-04-98'}, @code{'04-09-98'}).

@item
MySQL automatically converts a date or time type value to a number
if the value is used in a numeric context, and vice versa.

@item
When MySQL encounters a value for a date or time type that is out of
range or otherwise illegal for the type (as described at the beginning of
this section), it converts the value to the ``zero'' value for that type.
The exception is that out-of-range @code{TIME} values are clipped to the
appropriate endpoint of the @code{TIME} range.

The following table shows the format of the ``zero'' value for each type:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .55
@item @strong{Column Type} @tab @strong{``Zero'' Value}
@item @code{DATETIME}      @tab @code{'0000-00-00 00:00:00'}

@item @code{YEAR}          @tab @code{0000}
@end multitable

@item
The ``zero'' values are special, but you can store or refer to them
explicitly using the values shown in the table.  You can also do this
using the values @code{'0'} or @code{0}, which are easier to write.

@item
``Zero'' date or time values used through Connector/ODBC are converted
automatically to @code{NULL} in Connector/ODBC 2.50.12 and above,
because ODBC can't handle such values.

The @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} types are related.
This section describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ.

The @code{DATETIME} type is used when you need values that contain both date
and time information.  MySQL retrieves and displays @code{DATETIME}
values in @code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'} format.  The supported range is
@code{'1000-01-01 00:00:00'} to @code{'9999-12-31 23:59:59'}.  (``Supported''
means that although earlier values might work, there is no guarantee that
they will.)

The @code{DATE} type is used when you need only a date value, without a time
part.  MySQL retrieves and displays @code{DATE} values in
@code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} format.  The supported range is @code{'1000-01-01'} to
@code{'9999-12-31'}.

@c INSERT START
The @code{TIMESTAMP} column type has varying properties,
depending on the MySQL version and the SQL mode the server is running in.
These properties are described later in this section.

You can specify @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} values using
any of a common set of formats:

@itemize @bullet
@item
As a string in either @code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'} or @code{'YY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS'} format.  A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed---any punctuation
character may be used as the delimiter between date parts or time parts.
For example, @code{'98-12-31 11:30:45'}, @code{'98.12.31 11+30+45'},
@code{'98/12/31 11*30*45'}, and @code{'98@@12@@31 11^30^45'} are
equivalent.

@item
As a string in either @code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} or @code{'YY-MM-DD'} format.
A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed here, too.  For example, @code{'98-12-31'},
@code{'98.12.31'}, @code{'98/12/31'}, and @code{'98@@12@@31'} are
equivalent.

@item
As a string with no delimiters in either @code{'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'} or
@code{'YYMMDDHHMMSS'} format, provided that the string makes sense as a
date.  For example, @code{'19970523091528'} and @code{'970523091528'} are
interpreted as @code{'1997-05-23 09:15:28'}, but @code{'971122129015'} is
illegal (it has a nonsensical minute part) and becomes @code{'0000-00-00
00:00:00'}.

@item
As a string with no delimiters in either @code{'YYYYMMDD'} or @code{'YYMMDD'}
format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.  For example,
@code{'19970523'} and @code{'970523'} are interpreted as
@code{'1997-05-23'}, but @code{'971332'} is illegal (it has nonsensical month
and day parts) and becomes @code{'0000-00-00'}.

@item
As a number in either @code{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS} or @code{YYMMDDHHMMSS}
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
@code{19830905132800} and @code{830905132800} are interpreted as
@code{'1983-09-05 13:28:00'}.

@item
As a number in either @code{YYYYMMDD} or @code{YYMMDD}
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
@code{19830905} and @code{830905} are interpreted as @code{'1983-09-05'}.

@item
As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, or @code{TIMESTAMP} context, such as
@code{NOW()} or @code{CURRENT_DATE}.
@end itemize

Illegal @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, or @code{TIMESTAMP} values are converted
to the ``zero'' value of the appropriate type (@code{'0000-00-00 00:00:00'},
@code{'0000-00-00'}, or @code{00000000000000}).

For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for month or day values that are less than
@code{10}.  @code{'1979-6-9'} is the same as @code{'1979-06-09'}.  Similarly,
for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for hour, minute, or second values that are
less than @code{10}.  @code{'1979-10-30 1:2:3'} is the same as
@code{'1979-10-30 01:02:03'}.

Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits long.  If a
number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in @code{YYYYMMDD} or
@code{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS} format and that the year is given by the first 4
digits.  If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in
@code{YYMMDD} or @code{YYMMDDHHMMSS} format and that the year is given by the
first 2 digits.  Numbers that are not one of these lengths are interpreted
as though padded with leading zeros to the closest length.

@cindex non-delimited strings
@cindex strings, non-delimited
Values specified as non-delimited strings are interpreted using their length
as given.  If the string is 8 or 14 characters long, the year is assumed to
be given by the first 4 characters.  Otherwise, the year is assumed to be
given by the first 2 characters.  The string is interpreted from left to
right to find year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, for as many
parts as are present in the string.  This means you should not use strings
that have fewer than 6 characters.  For example, if you specify @code{'9903'},
thinking that will represent March, 1999, you will find that MySQL
inserts a ``zero'' date into your table.  This is because the year and month
values are @code{99} and @code{03}, but the day part is completely missing, so
the value is not a legal date.  However, as of MySQL 3.23, you can explicitly
specify a value of zero to represent missing month or day parts.  For example,
you can use @code{'990300'} to insert the value @code{'1999-03-00'}.

You can to some extent assign values of one date type to an object
of a different date type.  However, there may be some alteration
of the value or loss of information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you assign a @code{DATE} value to a @code{DATETIME} or @code{TIMESTAMP}
object, the time part of the resulting value is set to @code{'00:00:00'}
because the @code{DATE} value contains no time information.

@item
If you assign a @code{DATETIME} or @code{TIMESTAMP} value to a @code{DATE}
object, the time part of the resulting value is deleted because the
@code{DATE} type stores no time information.

@item
Remember that although @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, and @code{TIMESTAMP}
values all can be specified using the same set of formats, the types do not
all have the same range of values.  For example, @code{TIMESTAMP} values
cannot be earlier than @code{1970} or later than @code{2037}.  This means
that a date such as @code{'1968-01-01'}, while legal as a @code{DATETIME} or
@code{DATE} value, is not a valid @code{TIMESTAMP} value and will be
converted to @code{0} if assigned to such an object.
@end itemize

@cindex problems, date values
@cindex date values, problems
Be aware of certain pitfalls when specifying date values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The relaxed format allowed for values specified as strings can be deceiving.
For example, a value such as @code{'10:11:12'} might look like a time value
because of the @samp{:} delimiter, but if used in a date context will be
interpreted as the year @code{'2010-11-12'}.  The value @code{'10:45:15'}
will be converted to @code{'0000-00-00'} because @code{'45'} is not a legal
month.

@item
The MySQL server performs only basic checking on the validity of a date:
The ranges for year, month, and day are 1000 to 9999, 00 to 12, and 00
to 31.  Any date containing parts not within these ranges is subject to
conversion
to @code{'0000-00-00'}.  Please note that this still allows you to store
invalid dates such as @code{'2002-04-31'}.  To ensure a date is valid,
perform a check in your application.

@item
Dates containing two-digit year values are ambiguous because the century is
unknown.  MySQL interprets two-digit year values using the following
rules:

@itemize @minus
@item
Year values in the range @code{00-69} are converted to @code{2000-2069}.

@item
Year values in the range @code{70-99} are converted to @code{1970-1999}.

@node TIMESTAMP pre-4.1, TIMESTAMP 4.1, DATETIME, DATETIME
@subsubsection @code{TIMESTAMP} Properties Prior to MySQL 4.1

The @code{TIMESTAMP} column type provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark @code{INSERT} or @code{UPDATE} operations with the current
date and time.  If you have multiple @code{TIMESTAMP} columns in a table,
only the first one is updated automatically.

Automatic updating of the first @code{TIMESTAMP} column in a table occurs
under any of the following conditions:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You explicitly set the column to @code{NULL}.

@item
The column is not specified explicitly in an @code{INSERT} or
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement.

@item
The column is not specified explicitly in an @code{UPDATE} statement and some
other column changes value.  An @code{UPDATE} that sets a column
to the value it already has does not cause the @code{TIMESTAMP} column to be
updated; if you set a column to its current value, MySQL
ignores the update for efficiency.

@end itemize

@code{TIMESTAMP} columns other than the first can also be set to the current
date and time.  Just set the column to @code{NULL} or to @code{NOW()}.

You can set any @code{TIMESTAMP} column to a value different from the current
date and time by setting it explicitly to the desired value.  This is true
even for the first @code{TIMESTAMP} column.  You can use this property if,
for example, you want a @code{TIMESTAMP} to be set to the current date and
time when you create a row, but not to be changed whenever the row is updated
later:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Let MySQL set the column when the row is created.
This initializes it to the current date and time.

@item
When you perform subsequent updates to other columns in the row, set
the @code{TIMESTAMP} column explicitly to its current value:

@example
UPDATE tbl_name
SET timestamp_col = timestamp_col,
	other_col1 = new_value1,
	other_col2 = new_value2, ...
@end example

@end itemize

Another way to maintain a column that records row-creation time is to use
a @code{DATETIME} column that you initialize to @code{NOW()} when the row
is created and leave alone for subsequent updates.

@code{TIMESTAMP} values may range from the beginning of 1970 to sometime in
the year 2037, with a resolution of one second.  Values are displayed as
numbers.

The format in which MySQL retrieves and displays @code{TIMESTAMP}
values depends on the display size, as illustrated by the following table.  The
``full'' @code{TIMESTAMP} format is 14 digits, but @code{TIMESTAMP} columns may
be created with shorter display sizes:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .25
@item @strong{Column Type}  @tab @strong{Display Format}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(14)}  @tab @code{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(12)}  @tab @code{YYMMDDHHMMSS}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(10)}  @tab @code{YYMMDDHHMM}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(8)}   @tab @code{YYYYMMDD}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(6)}   @tab @code{YYMMDD}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(4)}   @tab @code{YYMM}
@item @code{TIMESTAMP(2)}   @tab @code{YY}
@end multitable

All @code{TIMESTAMP} columns have the same storage size, regardless of
display size.  The most common display sizes are 6, 8, 12, and 14.  You can
specify an arbitrary display size at table creation time, but values of 0 or
greater than 14 are coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to
13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

@code{TIMESTAMP} columns store legal values using the full precision with
which the value was specified, regardless of the display size.  This has
several implications:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Always specify year, month, and day, even if your column types are
@code{TIMESTAMP(4)} or @code{TIMESTAMP(2)}.  Otherwise, the value will not
be a legal date and @code{0} will be stored.

@item
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} to widen a narrow @code{TIMESTAMP} column,
information will be displayed that previously was ``hidden.''

@item
Similarly, narrowing a @code{TIMESTAMP} column does not cause information to
be lost, except in the sense that less information is shown when the values
are displayed.

@item
Although @code{TIMESTAMP} values are stored to full precision, the only
function that operates directly on the underlying stored value is
@code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()}.  Other functions operate on the formatted retrieved
value.  This means you cannot use functions such as @code{HOUR()} or
@code{SECOND()} unless the relevant part of the @code{TIMESTAMP} value is
included in the formatted value.  For example, the @code{HH} part of a
@code{TIMESTAMP} column is not displayed unless the display size is at least
10, so trying to use @code{HOUR()} on shorter @code{TIMESTAMP} values
produces a meaningless result.
@end itemize

@node TIMESTAMP 4.1,  , TIMESTAMP pre-4.1, DATETIME
@subsubsection @code{TIMESTAMP} Properties as of MySQL 4.1

From MySQL 4.1.0 on, @code{TIMESTAMP} properties differ from those of earlier
MySQL releases:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{TIMESTAMP} columns are displayed in the same format as @code{DATETIME}
columns.

@item
Display widths are not supported in the ways described in the preceding
section. In other words, you cannot use @code{TIMESTAMP(2)},
@code{TIMESTAMP(4)}, and so on.

@end itemize

In addition, if the MySQL server is running in @code{MAXDB} mode,
@code{TIMESTAMP} is identical with @code{DATETIME}. That is, if the server
is running in @code{MAXDB} mode at the time that a table is created, any
@code{TIMESTAMP} columns are created as @code{DATETIME} columns.  As a
result, such columns use @code{DATETIME} display format, have the same range
of values, and no automatic updating occurs.

MySQL can be run in @code{MAXDB} mode as of version 4.1.1.  To enable this
mode, set the server SQL mode to @code{MAXDB} at startup using the
@code{--sql-mode=MAXDB} server option or by setting the global
@code{sql_mode} variable at runtime:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_mode=MAXDB;
@end example

A client can cause the server to run in @code{MAXDB} mode for its own
connection as follows:

@example
mysql> SET SESSION sql_mode=MAXDB;
@end example


@node TIME, YEAR, DATETIME, Date and time types
@subsection The @code{TIME} Type

@tindex TIME

MySQL retrieves and displays @code{TIME} values in @code{'HH:MM:SS'}
format (or @code{'HHH:MM:SS'} format for large hours values).  @code{TIME}
values may range from @code{'-838:59:59'} to @code{'838:59:59'}.  The reason
the hours part may be so large is that the @code{TIME} type may be used not
only to represent a time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also
elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater
than 24 hours, or even negative).

You can specify @code{TIME} values in a variety of formats:

@itemize @bullet
@item
As a string in @code{'D HH:MM:SS.fraction'} format.
You can also use one of the following ``relaxed'' syntaxes:
@code{'HH:MM:SS.fraction'}, @code{'HH:MM:SS'}, @code{'HH:MM'}, @code{'D
HH:MM:SS'}, @code{'D HH:MM'}, @code{'D HH'}, or @code{'SS'}.  Here @code{D}
represents days and can have a value from 0 to 33.
Note that MySQL doesn't yet store the fraction part.

@item
As a string with no delimiters in @code{'HHMMSS'} format, provided that
it makes sense as a time.  For example, @code{'101112'} is understood as
@code{'10:11:12'}, but @code{'109712'} is illegal (it has a nonsensical
minute part) and becomes @code{'00:00:00'}.

@item
As a number in @code{HHMMSS} format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
For example, @code{101112} is understood as @code{'10:11:12'}.  The following
alternative formats are also understood: @code{SS}, @code{MMSS}, @code{HHMMSS},
@code{HHMMSS.fraction}.  Note that MySQL doesn't yet store the
fraction part.

@item
As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a @code{TIME} context, such as @code{CURRENT_TIME}.
@end itemize

For @code{TIME} values specified as strings that include a time part
delimiter, it is not necessary to specify two digits for hours, minutes, or
seconds values that are less than @code{10}.  @code{'8:3:2'} is the same as
@code{'08:03:02'}.

Be careful about assigning ``short'' @code{TIME} values to a @code{TIME}
column. Without colons, MySQL interprets values using the
assumption that the rightmost digits represent seconds. (MySQL
interprets @code{TIME} values as elapsed time rather than as time of
day.) For example, you might think of @code{'1112'} and @code{1112} as
meaning @code{'11:12:00'} (12 minutes after 11 o'clock), but
MySQL interprets them as @code{'00:11:12'} (11 minutes, 12 seconds).
Similarly, @code{'12'} and @code{12} are interpreted as @code{'00:00:12'}.
@code{TIME} values with colons, by contrast, are always treated as
time of the day. That is @code{'11:12'} will mean @code{'11:12:00'},
not @code{'00:11:12'}.

Values that lie outside the @code{TIME} range
but are otherwise legal are clipped to the closest
endpoint of the range.  For example, @code{'-850:00:00'} and
@code{'850:00:00'} are converted to @code{'-838:59:59'} and
@code{'838:59:59'}.

Illegal @code{TIME} values are converted to @code{'00:00:00'}.  Note that
because @code{'00:00:00'} is itself a legal @code{TIME} value, there is no way
to tell, from a value of @code{'00:00:00'} stored in a table, whether the
original value was specified as @code{'00:00:00'} or whether it was illegal.


@node YEAR, Y2K issues, TIME, Date and time types
@subsection The @code{YEAR} Type

@tindex YEAR

The @code{YEAR} type is a 1-byte type used for representing years.

@c TODO: fix to account for YEAR(2), which is different

MySQL retrieves and displays @code{YEAR} values in @code{YYYY}
format.  The range is @code{1901} to @code{2155}.

You can specify @code{YEAR} values in a variety of formats:

@itemize @bullet
@item
As a four-digit string in the range @code{'1901'} to @code{'2155'}.

@item
As a four-digit number in the range @code{1901} to @code{2155}.

@item
As a two-digit string in the range @code{'00'} to @code{'99'}.  Values in the
ranges @code{'00'} to @code{'69'} and @code{'70'} to @code{'99'} are
converted to @code{YEAR} values in the ranges @code{2000} to @code{2069} and
@code{1970} to @code{1999}.

@item
As a two-digit number in the range @code{1} to @code{99}.  Values in the
ranges @code{1} to @code{69} and @code{70} to @code{99} are converted to
@code{YEAR} values in the ranges @code{2001} to @code{2069} and @code{1970}
to @code{1999}.  Note that the range for two-digit numbers is slightly
different from the range for two-digit strings, because you cannot specify zero
directly as a number and have it be interpreted as @code{2000}.  You
must specify it as a string @code{'0'} or @code{'00'} or it will be
interpreted as @code{0000}.

@item
As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a @code{YEAR} context, such as @code{NOW()}.
@end itemize

Illegal @code{YEAR} values are converted to @code{0000}.


@node Y2K issues,  , YEAR, Date and time types
@subsection Y2K Issues and Date Types

@cindex Year 2000 issues
@cindex date types, Y2K issues

MySQL itself is year 2000 (Y2K) safe (@pxref{Year 2000 compliance}),
but input values presented to MySQL may not be.  Any input
containing two-digit year values is ambiguous, because the century is unknown.
Such values must be interpreted into four-digit form because MySQL stores
years internally using four digits.

For @code{DATETIME}, @code{DATE}, @code{TIMESTAMP}, and @code{YEAR} types,
MySQL interprets dates with ambiguous year values using the
following rules:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Year values in the range @code{00-69} are converted to @code{2000-2069}.

@item
Year values in the range @code{70-99} are converted to @code{1970-1999}.
@end itemize

Remember that these rules provide only reasonable guesses as to what your
data mean.  If the heuristics used by MySQL don't produce the
correct values, you should provide unambiguous input containing four-digit
year values.

@code{ORDER BY} sorts two-digit @code{YEAR/DATE/DATETIME} types properly.

Note also that some functions like @code{MIN()} and @code{MAX()} will convert a
@code{TIMESTAMP/DATE} to a number. This means that a timestamp with a
two-digit year will not work properly with these functions.  The fix in this
case is to convert the @code{TIMESTAMP/DATE} to four-digit year format or
use something like @code{MIN(DATE_ADD(timestamp,INTERVAL 0 DAYS))}.

The string types are @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, @code{BLOB}, @code{TEXT},
@code{ENUM}, and @code{SET}.  This section describes how these types work,
their storage requirements, and how to use them in your queries.


@node CHAR, BLOB, String types, String types
@subsection The @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} Types

The @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} types are similar, but differ in the
way they are stored and retrieved.

The length of a @code{CHAR} column is fixed to the length that you declare
when you create the table.  The length can be any value from 0 to 255.
(Before MySQL 3.23, the length of @code{CHAR} may be from 1 to 255.)
When @code{CHAR} values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length.  When @code{CHAR} values are retrieved, trailing spaces are
removed.

Values in @code{VARCHAR} columns are variable-length strings.  You can
declare a @code{VARCHAR} column to be any length from 0 to 255, just as
for @code{CHAR} columns.  (Before MySQL 4.0.2, the length of @code{VARCHAR}
may be from 1 to 255.) However, in contrast to @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}
values are stored using only as many characters as are needed, plus one byte
to record the length.  Values are not padded; instead, trailing spaces are
removed when values are stored.  (This space removal differs from the standard
SQL 
specification.) No case conversion takes place during storage or retrieval.

If you assign a value to a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} column that
exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

If you need a column for which trailing spaces are not removed, consider using
a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} type.

The following table illustrates the differences between the two types of columns
by showing the result of storing various string values into @code{CHAR(4)}
and @code{VARCHAR(4)} columns:

@c Need to use @(space) to make sure second column values retain spacing
@c in output for table below.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .20 .15 .20
@item @strong{Value}  @tab @code{CHAR(4)}     @tab @strong{Storage Required} @tab @code{VARCHAR(4)} @tab @strong{Storage Required}
@item @code{''}       @tab @code{'@ @ @ @ '} @tab 4 bytes @tab @code{''} @tab 1 byte
@item @code{'ab'}     @tab @code{'ab@ @ '}   @tab 4 bytes @tab @code{'ab'} @tab 3 bytes
@item @code{'abcd'}   @tab @code{'abcd'}     @tab 4 bytes @tab @code{'abcd'} @tab 5 bytes
@item @code{'abcdefgh'} @tab @code{'abcd'}     @tab 4 bytes @tab @code{'abcd'} @tab 5 bytes
@end multitable

The values retrieved from the @code{CHAR(4)} and @code{VARCHAR(4)} columns
will be the same in each case, because trailing spaces are removed from
@code{CHAR} columns upon retrieval.

Values in @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} columns are sorted and compared
in case-insensitive fashion, unless the @code{BINARY} attribute was
specified when the table was created.  The @code{BINARY} attribute means
that column values are sorted and compared in case-sensitive fashion using
the underlying character code values rather then a lexical ordering.
@code{BINARY} doesn't affect how the column is stored or retrieved.

From version 4.1.0, column type @code{CHAR BYTE} is an alias for
@code{CHAR BINARY}. This is a compatibility feature.

The @code{BINARY} attribute is sticky.  This means that if a column marked
@code{BINARY} is used in an expression, the whole expression is treated as a
@code{BINARY} value.

MySQL may silently change the type of a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR}
column at table creation time.

@xref{Storage requirements}.

The four @code{TEXT} types @code{TINYTEXT}, @code{TEXT}, @code{MEDIUMTEXT},
and @code{LONGTEXT} correspond to the four @code{BLOB} types and have the
same maximum lengths and storage requirements.  The only difference between
@code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} types is that sorting and comparison is performed
in case-sensitive fashion for @code{BLOB} values and case-insensitive fashion
for @code{TEXT} values.  In other words, a @code{TEXT} is a case-insensitive
@code{BLOB}. No case conversion takes place during storage or retrieval.

If you assign a value to a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} column that exceeds
the column type's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

In most respects, you can regard a @code{TEXT} column as a @code{VARCHAR}
column that can be as big as you like.  Similarly, you can regard a
@code{BLOB} column as a @code{VARCHAR BINARY} column.  The differences are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can have indexes on @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns only as of
MySQL 3.23.2. Older versions of MySQL did not support indexing these column
types.

@item
For indexes on @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns, you must specify an index
prefix length.

@item
There is no trailing-space removal for @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT}
columns when values are stored or retrieved. This differs from @code{CHAR}
columns (trailing spaces are removed when values are retrieved) and from
@code{VARCHAR} columns (trailing spaces are removed when values are stored).

@item
@cindex default values, @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns
@cindex @code{BLOB} columns, default values
@cindex @code{TEXT} columns, default values
@code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns cannot have @code{DEFAULT} values.
@end itemize

From version 4.1.0, @code{LONG} and @code{LONG VARCHAR} map to the
@code{MEDIUMTEXT} data type. This is a compatibility feature.

Connector/ODBC defines @code{BLOB} values as @code{LONGVARBINARY} and
@code{TEXT} values as @code{LONGVARCHAR}.

Because @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} values may be extremely long, you
may encounter some constraints in using them:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you want to use @code{GROUP BY} or @code{ORDER BY} on a @code{BLOB} or
@code{TEXT} column, you must convert the column value into a fixed-length
object. The standard way to do this is with the @code{SUBSTRING}
function.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT comment FROM tbl_name,SUBSTRING(comment,20) AS substr
    ->                 ORDER BY substr;
@end example

If you don't do this, only the first @code{max_sort_length} bytes of the
column are used when sorting.  The default value of @code{max_sort_length}
is 1024; this value can be changed using the @code{--max_sort_length}
option when starting the @code{mysqld} server.
@xref{Server system variables}.

You can group on an expression involving @code{BLOB} or
@code{TEXT} values by specifying the column position or by using an alias:

@example
mysql> SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100)
    -> FROM tbl_name GROUP BY 2;
mysql> SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100) AS b
    -> FROM tbl_name GROUP BY b;
@end example

@item
The maximum size of a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} object is determined by its
type, but the largest value you can actually transmit between the client and
server is determined by the amount of available memory and the size of the
communications buffers.  You can change the message buffer size by changing
the value of the
@code{max_allowed_packet} variable, but you must
do so for both the server and your client program.
For example, @code{mysql} and @code{mysqldump} each allow you to change the
client-side
@code{max_allowed_packet} value.
See
@ref{Server parameters},
@ref{mysql,  , @code{mysql}},
and
@ref{mysqldump,  , @code{mysqldump}}.
@end itemize

Note that each @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} value is represented
internally by a separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all
other column types, for which storage is allocated once per column when
the table is opened.


@node ENUM, SET, BLOB, String types
@subsection The @code{ENUM} Type

@tindex ENUM

An @code{ENUM} is a string object with a value normally chosen from a list
of allowed values that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification
at table creation time.

The value may also be the empty string (@code{''}) or @code{NULL} under
certain circumstances:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you insert an invalid value into an @code{ENUM} (that is, a string not
present in the list of allowed values), the empty string is inserted
instead as a special error value. This string can be distinguished from a
'normal' empty string by the fact that this string has the numerical value
0. More about this later.

@item
If an @code{ENUM} column is declared to allow @code{NULL}, the @code{NULL}
value is a legal value for the column, and the default value is @code{NULL}.
If an @code{ENUM} column is declared @code{NOT NULL}, its default value
is the first element of the list of allowed values.
@end itemize

Each enumeration value has an index:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Values from the list of allowable elements in the column specification are
numbered beginning with 1.

@item
The index value of the empty string error value is 0.  This means that you
can use the following @code{SELECT} statement to find rows into which invalid
@code{ENUM} values were assigned:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;
@end example

@item
The index of the @code{NULL} value is @code{NULL}.
@end itemize

For example, a column specified as @code{ENUM('one', 'two', 'three')} can
have any of the values shown here.  The index of each value is also shown:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .10
@item @strong{Value} @tab @strong{Index}
@item @code{NULL}    @tab @code{NULL}
@item @code{''}      @tab 0
@item @code{'one'}   @tab 1
@item @code{'two'}   @tab 2
@item @code{'three'} @tab 3
@end multitable

An enumeration can have a maximum of 65,535 elements.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.51, trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
@code{ENUM} values when the table is created.

Lettercase is irrelevant when you assign values to an @code{ENUM} column.
However, values retrieved from the column later are displayed using the
lettercase that was used in the column definition.

If you retrieve an @code{ENUM} value in a numeric context, the column value's
index is returned.  For example, you can retrieve numeric values from
an @code{ENUM} column like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
@end example

If you store a number into an @code{ENUM} column, the number is treated as an
index, and the value stored is the enumeration member with that index.
(However, this will not work with @code{LOAD DATA}, which treats all
input as strings.)
It's not advisable to define an @code{ENUM} column with enumeration values
that look like numbers, because this can easily become confusing. For example,
the following column has enumeration members with string values of
@code{'0'}, @code{'1'}, and @code{'2'},
but numeric index values of
@code{1}, @code{2}, and @code{3}:

@example
numbers ENUM('0','1','2')
@end example

@code{ENUM} values are sorted according to the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification.  (In other words,
@code{ENUM} values are sorted according to their index numbers.)  For
example, @code{'a'} sorts before @code{'b'} for @code{ENUM('a', 'b')}, but
@code{'b'} sorts before @code{'a'} for @code{ENUM('b', 'a')}.  The empty
string sorts before non-empty strings, and @code{NULL} values sort before
all other enumeration values.
To prevent unexpected results, specify the @code{ENUM} list in alphabetical
order. You can also use @code{GROUP BY CAST(col AS VARCHAR)} or
@code{GROUP BY CONCAT(col)} to make sure that the column
is sorted lexically rather than by index number.

If you want to get all possible values for an @code{ENUM} column, you should
use @code{SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name LIKE enum_col_name} and parse
the @code{ENUM} definition in the second column of the output.


@node SET,  , ENUM, String types
@subsection The @code{SET} Type

@tindex SET

A @code{SET} is a string object that can have zero or more values, each of
which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the table
is created.  @code{SET} column values that consist of multiple set members
are specified with members separated by commas (@samp{,}).  A consequence of
this is that @code{SET} member values cannot themselves contain commas.

For example, a column specified as @code{SET('one', 'two') NOT NULL} can have
any of these values:

@example
''
'one'
'two'
'one,two'
@end example


A @code{SET} can have a maximum of 64 different members.

Starting from 3.23.51 trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
@code{SET} values when the table is created.

MySQL stores @code{SET} values numerically, with the low-order bit
of the stored value corresponding to the first set member.  If you retrieve a
@code{SET} value in a numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set
corresponding to the set members that make up the column value.  For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from a @code{SET} column like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
@end example

If a number is stored into a @code{SET} column, the bits that
are set in the binary representation of the number determine the
set members in the column value.  For a column specified as
@code{SET('a','b','c','d')}, the the members have the following decimal and
binary values:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .20 .20
@item @code{SET} @strong{Member} @tab @strong{Decimal Value} @tab @strong{Binary Value}
@item @code{'a'} @tab @code{1} @tab @code{0001}
@item @code{'b'} @tab @code{2} @tab @code{0010}
@item @code{'c'} @tab @code{4} @tab @code{0100}
@item @code{'d'} @tab @code{8} @tab @code{1000}
@end multitable

If you assign a value of @code{9} to this column, that is @code{1001} in
binary, so the first and fourth @code{SET} value members @code{'a'} and
@code{'d'} are selected and the resulting value is @code{'a,d'}.

For a value containing more than one @code{SET} element, it does not matter
what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value.  It also
does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the value.
When the value is retrieved later, each element in the value will appear
once, with elements listed according to the order in which they were
specified at table creation time.  If a column is specified as
@code{SET('a','b','c','d')}, then @code{'a,d'}, @code{'d,a'}, and
@code{'d,a,a,d,d'} all will appear as @code{'a,d'} when retrieved.

If you set a @code{SET} column to an unsupported value, the value will
be ignored.

@code{SET} values are sorted numerically.  @code{NULL} values sort before
non-@code{NULL} @code{SET} values.

Normally, you perform a @code{SELECT} on a @code{SET} column using
the @code{LIKE} operator or the @code{FIND_IN_SET()} function:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)>0;
@end example

But the following will also work:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col & 1;
@end example

The first of these statements looks for an exact match.  The second looks
for values containing the first set member.

If you want to get all possible values for a @code{SET} column, you should
use @code{SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name LIKE set_col_name} and parse
the @code{SET} definition in the second column of the output.

@code{VARCHAR} and the @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} types are variable-length

column values (represented by @code{L} in the preceding table), rather than
on the type's maximum possible size.  For example, a @code{VARCHAR(10)}
column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters.  The actual
storage required is the length of the string (@code{L}), plus 1 byte to
record the length of the string.  For the string @code{'abcd'}, @code{L} is 4
and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

The @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} types require 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes to record
the length of the column value, depending on the maximum possible length of
the type.  @xref{BLOB,  , @code{BLOB}}.

@cindex ENUM, size
The size of an @code{ENUM} object is determined by the number of
different enumeration values.  One byte is used for enumerations with up
to 255 possible values.  Two bytes are used for enumerations with up to
65535 values. @xref{ENUM,  , @code{ENUM}}.

@cindex SET, size
The size of a @code{SET} object is determined by the number of different
set members.  If the set size is @code{N}, the object occupies @code{(N+7)/8}
bytes, rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes.  A @code{SET} can have a maximum
of 64 members. @xref{SET,  , @code{SET}}.

@section Choosing the Right Type for a Column

@cindex types, columns
@cindex choosing types

For the most efficient use of storage, try to use the most precise type in
all cases. For example, if an integer column will be used for values in the
range from @code{1} to @code{99999}, @code{MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED} is the
best type.  Of the types that represent all the required values, it uses
the least amount of storage.

Accurate representation of monetary values is a common problem. In
MySQL, you should use the @code{DECIMAL} type. This is stored as
a string, so no loss of accuracy should occur. If accuracy is not
too important, the @code{DOUBLE} type may also be good enough.

For high precision, you can always convert to a fixed-point type stored
in a @code{BIGINT}. This allows you to do all calculations with integers
and convert results back to floating-point values only when necessary.


@node Other-vendor column types,  , Choosing types, Column types
@section Using Column Types from Other Database Engines

@cindex types, portability
@cindex portability, types
@cindex columns, other types

To make it easier to use code written for SQL implementations from other
vendors, MySQL maps column types as shown in the following table.  These
mappings make it easier to import table definitions from other database engines
into MySQL:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .30
@item @strong{Other Vendor Type}        @tab @strong{MySQL Type}
@item @code{BINARY(NUM)}                @tab @code{CHAR(NUM) BINARY}
@item @code{CHAR VARYING(NUM)}          @tab @code{VARCHAR(NUM)}
@item @code{FLOAT4}                     @tab @code{FLOAT}
@item @code{FLOAT8}                     @tab @code{DOUBLE}
@item @code{INT1}                       @tab @code{TINYINT}
@item @code{INT2}                       @tab @code{SMALLINT}
@item @code{INT3}                       @tab @code{MEDIUMINT}
@item @code{INT4}                       @tab @code{INT}
@item @code{INT8}                       @tab @code{BIGINT}
@item @code{LONG VARBINARY}             @tab @code{MEDIUMBLOB}
@item @code{LONG VARCHAR}               @tab @code{MEDIUMTEXT}
@item @code{LONG}                       @tab @code{MEDIUMTEXT} (MySQL 4.1.0 on)
@item @code{MIDDLEINT}                  @tab @code{MEDIUMINT}
@item @code{VARBINARY(NUM)}             @tab @code{VARCHAR(NUM) BINARY}
@end multitable

Column type mapping occurs at table creation time.  If you create a table
with types used by other vendors and then issue a @code{DESCRIBE tbl_name}
statement, MySQL reports the table structure using the equivalent
MySQL types.

@c help_category Functions

Expressions can be used at several points in SQL statements, such as in the
@code{ORDER BY} or @code{HAVING} clauses of @code{SELECT} statements, in the
@code{WHERE} clause of a @code{SELECT}, @code{DELETE}, or @code{UPDATE}
statement, or in @code{SET} statements.  Expressions can be written using
literal values, column values, @code{NULL}, functions, and operators.
This chapter describes the functions and operators that are allowed for
writing expressions in MySQL.

An expression that contains @code{NULL} always produces a @code{NULL} value
unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for a particular function or
operator.

@strong{Note:} By default, there must be no whitespace between a function
name and the parenthesis following it. This helps the MySQL parser
distinguish between function calls and references to tables or columns that
happen to have the same name as a function.  Spaces around function
arguments are permitted, though.

You can tell the MySQL server to accept spaces after function names by
starting it with the @code{--sql-mode=IGNORE_SPACE} option. Individual client
programs can request this behavior by using the
@code{CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE} option for @code{mysql_real_connect()}.
In either case, all function names will become reserved words.

Comparison operations result in a value of @code{1} (TRUE), @code{0} (FALSE),
or @code{NULL}. These operations work for both numbers and strings.  Strings
are automatically converted to numbers and numbers to strings as necessary.

MySQL performs comparisons using the following
rules:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If one or both arguments are @code{NULL}, the result of the comparison is
@code{NULL}, except for the @code{NULL}-safe @code{<=>} equality comparison
operator.

@item
If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they are compared as
strings.

@item
If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.

@item
Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not compared to a number.

@item
@cindex ODBC compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with ODBC
If one of the arguments is a @code{TIMESTAMP} or @code{DATETIME} column and
the other argument is a constant, the constant is converted
to a timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to be more
ODBC-friendly. Note that the is not done for arguments in @code{IN()}!
To be safe, always use complete datetime/date/time string when doing
comparisons.

@item
In all other cases, the arguments are compared as floating-point (real)
numbers.
@end itemize

By default, string comparisons are not case sensitive and use the
current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default, which also works
excellently for English).

The following examples illustrate conversion of strings to numbers for comparison
operations:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1 > '6x';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 7 > '6x';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 0 > 'x6';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 0 = 'x6';
        -> 1
@end example

Note that when you are comparing a string column with a number, MySQL can't
use an index on the column to quickly look up the value.  If @code{str_col}
is an indexed string column, the index cannot be used when performing the
lookup in the following statement:

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE str_col=1;
@end example

The reason for this is that there are many different strings that may
convert to the value @code{1}:  @code{'1'}, @code{' 1'}, @code{'1a'} ...

@cindex ODBC compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with ODBC
To be able to work well with ODBC programs, MySQL supports the following
extra features when using @code{IS NULL}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You can find the row that contains the most recent @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value
by issuing a statement of the following form immediately after generating the
value:

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
@end example

This behavior can be disabled by setting @code{SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL=0}.
@xref{SET OPTION}.

@item
For @code{DATE} and @code{DATETIME} columns that are declared as @code{NOT
NULL}, you can find the special date @code{'0000-00-00'} by using a statement
like this:

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date_column IS NULL
@end example

This is needed to get some ODBC applications to work because ODBC doesn't
support a @code{'0000-00-00'} date value.

@end example
Before MySQL 3.22.5, you can use @code{MAX()}
instead of @code{GREATEST()}.

@c description_for_help_topic IN
@item expr IN (value,...)
@findex IN
Returns @code{1} if @code{expr} is any of the values in the @code{IN} list,
else returns @code{0}.  If all values are constants, they are
evaluated according to the type of @code{expr} and sorted. The search for the
item then is done using a binary search. This means @code{IN} is very quick
if the @code{IN} value list consists entirely of constants.  If @code{expr}
is a case-sensitive string expression, the string comparison is performed in
case-sensitive fashion.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic IN
@example
mysql> SELECT 2 IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'wefwf' IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -> 1
@end example

The number of values in the @code{IN} list is only limited by the
@code{max_allowed_packet} value.

To comply with the SQL standard,
from MySQL 4.1 on
@code{IN} returns @code{NULL} 
not only if the expression on the left hand side is @code{NULL}, but also if
no match is found in the list and one of the expressions in the list is 
@code{NULL}.

From MySQL 4.1 on, @code{IN()} syntax also is used to write certain types of
subqueries.
@xref{ANY IN SOME subqueries}.

@c description_for_help_topic NOT IN

@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic ISNULL

Note that a comparison of @code{NULL} values using @code{=} will always be
false!

@c description_for_help_topic INTERVAL
@item INTERVAL(N,N1,N2,N3,...)

Returns @code{0} if @code{N} < @code{N1}, @code{1} if @code{N} < @code{N2}
and so on or @code{-1} if @code{N} is @code{NULL}. All arguments are treated
as integers.  It is required that @code{N1} < @code{N2} < @code{N3} < 
@code{...} < @code{Nn} for this function to work correctly. This is because
a binary search is used (very fast).

@c description_for_help_topic LEAST
@item LEAST(value1,value2,...)
@findex LEAST()
With two or more arguments, returns the smallest (minimum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the following rules.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the return value is used in an @code{INTEGER} context or all arguments
are integer-valued, they are compared as integers.

@item
If the return value is used in a @code{REAL} context or all arguments are
real-valued, they are compared as reals.

@item
If any argument is a case-sensitive string, the arguments are compared
as case-sensitive strings.

@item
In other cases, the arguments are compared as case-insensitive strings.
@end itemize
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic LEAST
@example
mysql> SELECT LEAST(2,0);

        -> 3.0
mysql> SELECT LEAST('B','A','C');
        -> 'A'
@end example
Before MySQL 3.22.5, you can use @code{MIN()}
instead of @code{LEAST()}.

Note that the preceding conversion rules can produce strange results in some
borderline cases:

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST(LEAST(3600, 9223372036854775808.0) as SIGNED);
        -> -9223372036854775808
@end example

This happens because MySQL reads @code{9223372036854775808.0} in an
integer context. The integer representation is not good enough to
hold the value, so it wraps to a signed integer.

In SQL, all logical operators evaluate to TRUE, FALSE, or @code{NULL} (UNKNOWN).

Please note that MySQL versions prior to 4.0.5 stop evaluation when
a @code{NULL} is encountered, rather than continuing the process to
check for possible @code{0} values. This means that in these versions,
@code{SELECT (NULL AND 0)} returns @code{NULL} instead of @code{0}.

@findex BINARY
The @code{BINARY} operator casts the string following it to a binary string.
This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be case sensitive even
if the column isn't defined as @code{BINARY} or @code{BLOB}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{BINARY} was added in MySQL 3.23.0. As of MySQL 4.0.2,
@code{BINARY str} is a shorthand for @code{CAST(str AS BINARY)}.
@xref{Cast Functions}.

Note that in some contexts, if you cast an indexed column to @code{BINARY},
MySQL will not be able to use the index efficiently.

@end table

If you want to compare a @code{BLOB} value in case-insensitive fashion, you
can do so as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Before MySQL 4.1.1, use the @code{UPPER()} function to convert the @code{BLOB}
value to uppercase before performing the comparison:

@example
SELECT 'A' LIKE UPPER(blob_col) FROM tbl_name;
@end example

If the comparison value is lowercase, convert the @code{BLOB} value using
@code{LOWER()} instead.

@item
For MySQL 4.1.1 and up, @code{BLOB} columns have a character set of
@code{binary}, which has no concept of lettercase. To perform a
case-insensitive comparison, use the @code{CONVERT()} function to
convert the @code{BLOB} value to a character set that
is not case sensitive. The result is a non-binary string, so the
@code{LIKE} operation is not case sensitive:

@example
SELECT 'A' LIKE CONVERT(blob_col USING latin1) FROM tbl_name;
@end example

To use a different character set, substitute its name for @code{latin1}
in the preceding statement.

@end itemize

@code{CONVERT()} can be used more generally for comparing strings that
are represented in different character sets.

@findex CASE

The first version returns the @code{result} where

@c description_for_help_topic IF
@item IF(expr1,expr2,expr3)
@findex IF()
If @code{expr1} is TRUE (@code{expr1 <> 0} and @code{expr1 <> NULL}) then
@code{IF()} returns @code{expr2}, else it returns @code{expr3}.
@code{IF()} returns a numeric or string value, depending on the context
in which it is used.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic IF
@example
mysql> SELECT IF(1>2,2,3);

        -> 'yes'
mysql> SELECT IF(STRCMP('test','test1'),'no','yes');
        -> 'no'
@end example

If only one of @code{expr2} or @code{expr3} is explicitly @code{NULL}, the
result type of the @code{IF()} function is the type of non-@code{NULL}
expression.  (This behavior is new in MySQL 4.0.3.)

@code{expr1} is evaluated as an integer value, which means that if you are
testing floating-point or string values, you should do so using a comparison
operation.

@example
mysql> SELECT IF(0.1,1,0);
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT IF(0.1<>0,1,0);
        -> 1
@end example

In the first case shown, @code{IF(0.1)} returns @code{0} because @code{0.1}
is converted to an integer value, resulting in a test of @code{IF(0)}.  This
may not be what you expect.  In the second case, the comparison tests the
original floating-point value to see whether it is non-zero.  The result
of the comparison is used as an integer.

The default return type of @code{IF()} (which may matter when it is
stored into a temporary table) is calculated in MySQL
3.23 as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .50 .20
@item @strong{Expression} @tab @strong{Return Value}
@item @code{expr2} or @code{expr3} returns a string @tab string
@item @code{expr2} or @code{expr3} returns a floating-point value @tab floating-point
@item @code{expr2} or @code{expr3} returns an integer @tab integer
@end multitable

If @code{expr2} and @code{expr3} are strings, the result is case
sensitive if either string is case sensitive (starting from MySQL
3.23.51).

@c description_for_help_topic IFNULL
@item IFNULL(expr1,expr2)
@cindex @code{NULL}, testing for null
@findex IFNULL()
If @code{expr1} is not @code{NULL}, @code{IFNULL()} returns @code{expr1},

        -> 10
mysql> SELECT IFNULL(1/0,'yes');
        -> 'yes'
@end example

In MySQL 4.0.6 and above, the default result value of
@code{IFNULL(expr1,expr2)} is the more ``general'' of the two expressions,
in the order @code{STRING}, @code{REAL}, or @code{INTEGER}. The difference
from earlier MySQL versions is mostly notable when you create a table
based on expressions or MySQL has to internally store a value from
@code{IFNULL()} in a temporary table.

@example
CREATE TABLE tmp SELECT IFNULL(1,'test') AS test;
@end example

As of MySQL 4.0.6, the type for the @code{test} column is @code{CHAR(4)},
whereas in earlier versions the type would be @code{BIGINT}.

@c description_for_help_topic NULLIF

This means that for a string containing five two-byte characters,
@code{LENGTH()} returns @code{10}, whereas @code{CHAR_LENGTH()} returns
@code{5}.

@code{CHARACTER_LENGTH()} is a synonym for @code{CHAR_LENGTH()}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic COMPRESS
@item COMPRESS(string_to_compress)
@findex COMPRESS()
Compresses a string. This function requires MySQL to have been compiled
with a compression library such as @code{zlib}. Otherwise, the return
value is always @code{NULL}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic COMPRESS
@example
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(REPEAT('a',1000)));
        -> 21
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(''));
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS('a'));
        -> 13
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(COMPRESS(REPEAT('a',16)));
        -> 15
@end example

The compressed string contents are stored the following way:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Empty strings are stored as empty strings.
@item
Non-empty strings are stored as a four-byte length of the uncompressed string
(low byte first), followed by the compressed string.  If the
string ends with space, an extra @samp{.} character is added to avoid
problems with endspace trimming should the result be stored in a @code{CHAR}
or @code{VARCHAR} column.  (Use of @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} to store
compressed strings is not recommended. It is better to use a @code{BLOB}
column instead.)
@end itemize

@code{COMPRESS()} was added in MySQL 4.1.1.


@c description_for_help_topic CONCAT
@item CONCAT(str1,str2,...)
@findex CONCAT()
Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments.  Returns
@code{NULL} if any argument is @code{NULL}.  May have one or more arguments.
A numeric argument is converted to its equivalent string form.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CONCAT
@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');
        -> 'MySQL'
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL');
        -> NULL
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(14.3);
        -> '14.3'
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic CONCAT_WS
@item CONCAT_WS(separator,str1,str2,...)
@findex CONCAT_WS()

@code{CONCAT_WS()} stands for CONCAT With Separator and is a special form of
@code{CONCAT()}.  The first argument is the separator for the rest of the
arguments.
The separator is added between the strings to be concatenated.
The separator can be a string as can the rest of the
arguments. If the separator is @code{NULL}, the result is @code{NULL}.
The function skips any @code{NULL} values after the
separator argument.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CONCAT_WS
@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT_WS(',','First name','Second name','Last Name');
        -> 'First name,Second name,Last Name'
mysql> SELECT CONCAT_WS(',','First name',NULL,'Last Name');
        -> 'First name,Last Name'
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0.14, @code{CONCAT_WS()} skips empty strings as well as
@code{NULL} values.

@c description_for_help_topic CONV
@item CONV(N,from_base,to_base)
@findex CONV()
Converts numbers between different number bases.  Returns a string
representation of the number @code{N}, converted from base @code{from_base}
to base @code{to_base}.  Returns @code{NULL} if any argument is @code{NULL}.
The argument @code{N} is interpreted as an integer, but may be specified as
an integer or a string.  The minimum base is @code{2} and the maximum base is
@code{36}.  If @code{to_base} is a negative number, @code{N} is regarded as a
signed number.  Otherwise, @code{N} is treated as unsigned.  @code{CONV()} works
with 64-bit precision.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CONV
@example
mysql> SELECT CONV('a',16,2);
        -> '1010'

@c description_for_help_topic EXPORT_SET
@item EXPORT_SET(bits,on,off,[separator,[number_of_bits]])
@findex EXPORT_SET()
Returns a string in which for every bit set in @code{bits}, you get an @code{on} 
string and for every reset bit you get an @code{off} string. Each string is 
separated by @code{separator} (default @samp{,}), and only 
@code{number_of_bits} (default 64) of @code{bits} is used.

@end example

@c description_for_help_topic FIND_IN_SET
@item FIND_IN_SET(str,strlist)
@findex FIND_IN_SET()
Returns a value @code{1} to @code{N} if the string @code{str} is in the string list
@code{strlist} consisting of @code{N} substrings. A string list is a string
composed of substrings separated by @samp{,} characters. If the first
argument is a constant string and the second is a column of type @code{SET},
the @code{FIND_IN_SET()} function is optimized to use bit arithmetic.
Returns @code{0} if @code{str} is not in @code{strlist} or if @code{strlist}
is the empty string.  Returns @code{NULL} if either argument is @code{NULL}.
This function will not work properly if the first argument contains a comma
(@samp{,}) character.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic FIND_IN_SET

@findex HEX()

If @code{N_OR_S} is a number, returns a string representation of the hexadecimal
value of @code{N}, where @code{N} is a longlong (@code{BIGINT}) number.
This is equivalent to @code{CONV(N,10,16)}.

From MySQL 4.0.1 and up,
if @code{N_OR_S} is a string, returns a hexadecimal string of @code{N_OR_S}
where each character in @code{N_OR_S} is converted to two hexadecimal digits.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic HEX

@c description_for_help_topic LOAD_FILE
@item LOAD_FILE(file_name)
@findex FILE
@findex LOAD_FILE()
Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string.  The file
must be located on the server, you must specify the full pathname to the
file, and you must have the @code{FILE} privilege.  The file must
be readable by all and be smaller than @code{max_allowed_packet} bytes.

If the file doesn't exist or cannot be read because one of the preceding
conditions is not satisfied, the function returns @code{NULL}.

@findex UNHEX()

Does the opposite of @code{HEX(string)}. That is, it interprets each pair of
hexadecimal digits in the argument as a number and converts it to the
character represented by the number. The resulting characters are returned as
a binary string.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic UNHEX
@example
mysql> SELECT UNHEX('4D7953514C');
        -> 'MySQL'
mysql> SELECT 0x4D7953514C;
        -> 'MySQL'
mysql> SELECT UNHEX(HEX('string'));
        -> 'string'
mysql> SELECT HEX(UNHEX('1267'));
        -> '1267'
@end example

@code{UNHEX()} was added in MySQL 4.1.2.

@c description_for_help_topic UPPER
@item UPPER(str)
@findex UPPER()
Returns the string @code{str} with all characters changed to uppercase
according to the current character set mapping (the default is ISO-8859-1
Latin1).
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic UPPER
@example
mysql> SELECT UPPER('Hej');
        -> 'HEJ'
@end example

This function is multi-byte safe.

@subsection String Comparison Functions

@findex string comparison functions
@findex functions, string comparison

MySQL automatically converts numbers to strings as necessary, and
vice versa.

@example
mysql> SELECT 1+'1';
        -> 2
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');
        -> '2 test'
@end example

If you want to convert a number to a string explicitly, use the @code{CAST()}
or @code{CONCAT()} function:

@example
mysql> SELECT 38.8, CAST(38.8 AS CHAR);
        -> 38.8, '38.8'
mysql> SELECT 38.8, CONCAT(38.8);
        -> 38.8, '38.8'
@end example

@code{CAST()} is preferable, but it is unavailable before MySQL 4.0.2.

If a string function is given a binary string as an argument, the resulting
string is also a binary string.  A number converted to a string is treated as
a binary string.  This affects only comparisons.

@cindex case sensitivity, in string comparisons
@cindex string comparisons, case sensitivity

Normally, if any expression in a string comparison is case sensitive, the
comparison is performed in case-sensitive fashion.

@table @code

@c description_for_help_topic LIKE  ESCAPE
@item expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']
@findex LIKE
Pattern matching using
SQL simple regular expression comparison. Returns @code{1} (TRUE) or @code{0}
(FALSE).  If either @code{expr} or @code{pat} is @code{NULL}, the result is
@code{NULL}.

With @code{LIKE} you can use the following two wildcard characters
in the pattern:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{Character} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{%} @tab Matches any number of characters, even zero characters
@item @code{_} @tab Matches exactly one character
@end multitable
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic LIKE
@example
mysql> SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David_';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'David!' LIKE '%D%v%';
        -> 1
@end example

To test for literal instances of a wildcard character, precede the character
with the escape character.  If you don't specify the @code{ESCAPE} character,
@samp{\} is assumed.

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{String} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{\%} @tab Matches one @samp{%} character
@item @code{\_} @tab Matches one @samp{_} character
@end multitable

@example
mysql> SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David\_';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David\_';
        -> 1
@end example

To specify a different escape character, use the @code{ESCAPE} clause:

@example
mysql> SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David|_' ESCAPE '|';
        -> 1
@end example

The following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are
not case sensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string:

@example
mysql> SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'ABC';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'abc' LIKE BINARY 'ABC';
        -> 0
@end example

In MySQL, @code{LIKE} is allowed on numeric expressions. (This is an
extension to the standard SQL @code{LIKE}.)

@example
mysql> SELECT 10 LIKE '1%';
        -> 1
@end example

Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for example,
@samp{\n} to represent newline), you must double any @samp{\} that you use in your @code{LIKE}
strings.  For example, to search for @samp{\n}, specify it as @samp{\\n}.  To
search for @samp{\}, specify it as @samp{\\\\} (the backslashes are stripped
once by the parser and another time when the pattern match is done, leaving
a single backslash to be matched).

@strong{Note:} Currently @code{LIKE} is not multi-byte character safe.
Comparison is done character by character.

@c description_for_help_topic NOT LIKE
@item expr NOT LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']
@findex NOT LIKE

This is the same as @code{NOT (expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char'])}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic NOT REGEXP
@item expr NOT REGEXP pat
@itemx expr NOT RLIKE pat
@findex NOT REGEXP

This is the same as @code{NOT (expr REGEXP pat)}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@cindex mSQL compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with mSQL
@findex REGEXP
@findex RLIKE
@c description_for_help_topic RLIKE  REGEXP
@item expr REGEXP pat
@itemx expr RLIKE pat
Performs a pattern match of a string expression @code{expr} against a pattern
@code{pat}.  The pattern can be an extended regular expression.
The syntax for regular expressions is discussed in
@ref{Regexp}.  Returns @code{1} if @code{expr} matches @code{pat}, otherwise
returns @code{0}.  If either @code{expr} or @code{pat} is @code{NULL},
the result is @code{NULL}.  @code{RLIKE} is a synonym for @code{REGEXP},
provided for
@code{mSQL} compatibility. Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape
syntax in strings (for example, @samp{\n} to represent newline), you must double any @samp{\} that
you use in your @code{REGEXP} strings.  As of MySQL 3.23.4,
@code{REGEXP} is not case sensitive for normal (not binary) strings.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic RLIKE
@example
mysql> SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP 'm%y%%';
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP '.*';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'new*\n*line' REGEXP 'new\\*.\\*line';
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'a' REGEXP 'A', 'a' REGEXP BINARY 'A';
        -> 1  0
mysql> SELECT 'a' REGEXP '^[a-d]';
        -> 1
@end example

@code{REGEXP} and @code{RLIKE} use the current character set (ISO-8859-1
Latin1 by default) when deciding the type of a character.
However, these operators are not multi-byte safe.

@c description_for_help_topic STRCMP
@item STRCMP(expr1,expr2)
@findex STRCMP()
@code{STRCMP()}
returns @code{0} if the strings are the same, @code{-1} if the first
argument is smaller than the second according to the current sort order,
and @code{1} otherwise.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic STRCMP
@example
mysql> SELECT STRCMP('text', 'text2');
        -> -1
mysql> SELECT STRCMP('text2', 'text');
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT STRCMP('text', 'text');
        -> 0
@end example

As of MySQL 4.0,
@code{STRCMP()} uses the current character set when performing comparisons.
This makes the default comparison behavior case insensitive unless
one or both of the operands are binary strings.
Before MySQL 4.0, @code{STRCMP()} is case sensitive.

@end example

You can't use a column with @code{RAND()} values in an @code{ORDER BY}
clause, because @code{ORDER BY} would evaluate the column multiple times.
As of MySQL 3.23, you can retrieve rows in random order like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name ORDER BY RAND();
@end example

@code{ORDER BY RAND()} combined with @code{LIMIT} is useful for selecting
a random sample of a set of rows:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM table1, table2 WHERE a=b AND c<d
    -> ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000;
@end example

Note that @code{RAND()} in a @code{WHERE} clause is re-evaluated
every time the @code{WHERE} is executed.

@code{RAND()} is not meant to be a perfect random generator, but instead a
fast way to generate ad hoc random numbers that will be portable between
platforms for the same MySQL version.

@c description_for_help_topic ROUND
@item ROUND(X)
@itemx ROUND(X,D)
@findex ROUND()
Returns the argument @code{X}, rounded to the nearest integer.
With two arguments, returns @code{X} rounded to @code{D} decimals.
If @code{D} is negative, the integer part of the number is zeroed out.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Note that the behavior of @code{ROUND()} when the argument
is halfway between two integers depends on the C library
implementation.  Different implementations round to the nearest even number,
always up, always down, or always toward zero.  If you need
one kind of rounding, you should use a well-defined function
such as @code{TRUNCATE()} or @code{FLOOR()} instead.

@c description_for_help_topic SIGN

Starting from MySQL 3.23.51, all numbers are rounded toward zero.

Note that decimal numbers are normally not stored as exact numbers in
computers, but as double-precision values, so you may be surprised by the
following result:

This happens because @code{10.28} is actually stored as something like
@code{10.2799999999999999}.

@node Date and time functions, Fulltext Search, Numeric Functions, Functions
@section Date and Time Functions
@c help_category Date and Time Functions@Functions

@findex date and time functions
@findex functions, date and time

This section describes the functions that can be used to manipulate
temporal values.
See @ref{Date and time types} for a description of the range of values
each date and time type has and the valid formats in which values may be
specified.

Here is an example that uses date functions.  The following query selects
all records with a @code{date_col} value from within the last 30 days:

@example
mysql> SELECT something FROM tbl_name
    -> WHERE DATE_SUB(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 30 DAY) <= date_col;
@end example

Note that the query also will select records with dates that lie in the
future.

Functions that expect date values usually will accept datetime values
and ignore the time part. Functions that expect time values usually will
accept datetime values and ignore the date part.

Functions that return the current date or time each are evaluated only once
per query at the start of query execution. This means that multiple references
to a function such as @code{NOW()} within a single query will always produce
the same result.  This principle also applies to @code{CURDATE()},
@code{CURTIME()}, @code{UTC_DATE()}, @code{UTC_TIME()}, @code{UTC_TIMESTAMP()},
and to any of their synonyms.

The return value ranges in the following function descriptions apply for
complete dates. If a date is a ``zero'' value or an incomplete date such
as @code{'2001-11-00'}, functions that extract a part of a date may return
@code{0}. For example, @code{DAYOFMONTH('2001-11-00')} returns @code{0}.

@c description_for_help_topic ADDDATE
@item ADDDATE(date,INTERVAL expr type)
@itemx ADDDATE(expr,days)
@findex ADDDATE()

When invoked with the @code{INTERVAL} form of the second argument,
@code{ADDDATE()} is a synonym for @code{DATE_ADD()}.  The related
function @code{SUBDATE()} is a synonym for @code{DATE_SUB()}.
For information on the @code{INTERVAL} argument, see the
discussion for @code{DATE_ADD()}.

@example
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('1998-01-02', INTERVAL 31 DAY);
        -> '1998-02-02'
mysql> SELECT ADDDATE('1998-01-02', INTERVAL 31 DAY);
        -> '1998-02-02'
@end example

As of MySQL 4.1.1, the second syntax is allowed, where @code{expr} is a date
or datetime expression and @code{days} is the number of days to be added to
@code{expr}.

@item DATE_ADD(date,INTERVAL expr type)
@itemx DATE_SUB(date,INTERVAL expr type)
@findex DATE_ADD()
@findex DATE_SUB()

These functions perform date arithmetic.
@code{date} is a @code{DATETIME} or @code{DATE} value specifying the starting
date.  @code{expr} is an expression specifying the interval value to be added
or subtracted from the starting date.  @code{expr} is a string; it may start
with a @samp{-} for negative intervals.  @code{type} is a keyword indicating
how the expression should be interpreted.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The @code{INTERVAL} keyword and the @code{type} specifier are not case
sensitive.

The following table shows how the @code{type} and @code{expr} arguments
are related:

@end multitable

The @code{type} values @code{DAY_MICROSECOND}, @code{HOUR_MICROSECOND},
@code{MINUTE_MICROSECOND}, @code{SECOND_MICROSECOND},
and @code{MICROSECOND} are allowed as of MySQL 4.1.1.
The values @code{QUARTER} and @code{WEEK} are allowed as of MySQL 5.0.0.

MySQL allows any punctuation delimiter in the @code{expr} format.
Those shown in the table are the suggested delimiters.  If the @code{date}
argument is a @code{DATE} value and your calculations involve only
@code{YEAR}, @code{MONTH}, and @code{DAY} parts (that is, no time parts), the
result is a @code{DATE} value.  Otherwise, the result is a @code{DATETIME}
value.

As of MySQL 3.23, @code{INTERVAL expr type} is allowed on either
side of the @code{+} operator if the expression on the other side is a
date or datetime value.
For the @code{-} operator, @code{INTERVAL expr type} is allowed only on
the right side, because
it makes no sense to subtract a date or datetime value from an interval.
(See examples below.)

    ->            INTERVAL '1.999999' SECOND_MICROSECOND);
        -> '1993-01-01 00:00:01.000001'
@end example

If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not include all the
interval parts that would be expected from the @code{type} keyword),
MySQL assumes that you have left out the leftmost parts of the interval
value.  For example, if you specify a @code{type} of @code{DAY_SECOND}, the
value of @code{expr} is expected to have days, hours, minutes, and seconds
parts.  If you specify a value like @code{'1:10'}, MySQL assumes
that the days and hours parts are missing and the value represents minutes
and seconds.  In other words, @code{'1:10' DAY_SECOND} is interpreted in such
a way that it is equivalent to @code{'1:10' MINUTE_SECOND}.  This is
analogous to the way that MySQL interprets @code{TIME} values
as representing elapsed time rather than as time of day.

If you add to or subtract from a date value something that
contains a time part, the result is automatically converted to a
datetime value:

@example
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('1999-01-01', INTERVAL 1 DAY);
        -> '1999-01-02'
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('1999-01-01', INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
        -> '1999-01-01 01:00:00'
@end example

If you use really malformed dates, the result is @code{NULL}. If you add
@code{MONTH}, @code{YEAR_MONTH}, or @code{YEAR} and the resulting date
has a day that is larger than the maximum day for the new month, the day is
adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:

@example
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('1998-01-30', INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
        -> '1998-02-28'
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic DATE_FORMAT

All other characters are copied to the result without interpretation.

The @code{%v}, @code{%V}, @code{%x}, and @code{%X} format specifiers are
available as of MySQL 3.23.8.  @code{%f} is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

As of MySQL 3.23, the @samp{%} character is required before
format specifier characters.  In earlier versions of MySQL,
@samp{%} was optional.

The reason the ranges for the month and day specifiers begin with zero
is that MySQL allows incomplete dates such as @code{'2004-00-00'} to be
stored as of MySQL 3.23.

@code{'1970-01-01 00:00:00'} GMT) as an unsigned integer. If
@code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} is called with a @code{date} argument, it
returns the value of the argument as seconds since @code{'1970-01-01
00:00:00'} GMT.  @code{date} may be a @code{DATE} string, a
@code{DATETIME} string, a @code{TIMESTAMP}, or a number in the format
@code{YYMMDD} or @code{YYYYMMDD} in local time.

mysql> SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1997-10-04 22:23:00');
        -> 875996580
@end example

When @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP} is used on a @code{TIMESTAMP} column, the function
returns the internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit
``string-to-Unix-timestamp'' conversion.
If you pass an out-of-range date to @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()}, it
returns @code{0}, but please note that only basic range checking is performed
(year from @code{1970} to @code{2037}, month from @code{01} to @code{12}, day
from @code{01} from @code{31}).

If you want to subtract @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} columns, you might want to
cast the result to signed integers. @xref{Cast Functions}.

The function returns the week number for @code{date}.  The two-argument form
of @code{WEEK()} allows you to specify whether the week starts on Sunday or
Monday and whether the return value should be in the range from @code{0} to
@code{53} or from @code{1} to @code{52}. If the @code{mode} argument is
omitted, the value of the @code{default_week_format} system variable is
used (or @code{0} before MySQL 4.0.14).

@c example_for_help_topic WEEK
@example
mysql> SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20');
        -> 7
mysql> SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',0);
        -> 7
mysql> SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',1);
        -> 8
mysql> SELECT WEEK('1998-12-31',1);
        -> 53
@end example

Note: In MySQL 4.0, @code{WEEK(date,0)} was changed to match the
calendar in the USA.  Before that, @code{WEEK()} was calculated incorrectly
for dates in the USA. (In effect, @code{WEEK(date)} and @code{WEEK(date,0)} were
incorrect for all cases.)

Note that if a date falls in the last week of the previous year, MySQL
returns @code{0} if you don't use @code{2}, @code{3}, @code{6}, or @code{7}
as the optional @code{mode} argument:

@example
mysql> SELECT YEAR('2000-01-01'), WEEK('2000-01-01',0);
        -> 2000, 0
@end example

One might argue that MySQL should return @code{52} for the @code{WEEK()}
function, because the given date actually occurs in the 52nd week of 1999.  We
decided to return @code{0} instead because we want the function to return ``the week
number in the given year.''  This makes use of the @code{WEEK()}
function reliable when combined with other functions that extract a
date part from a date.

If you would prefer the result to be evaluated with respect to the year
that contains the first day of the week for the given date, you should use
@code{2}, @code{3}, @code{6}, or @code{7} as the optional @code{mode} argument.

@example
mysql> SELECT WEEK('2000-01-01',2);
        -> 52
@end example

Alternatively, use the @code{YEARWEEK()} function:

@example
mysql> SELECT YEARWEEK('2000-01-01');

As of MySQL 3.23.23, MySQL has support for full-text indexing
and searching.  A full-text index in MySQL is an index of type
@code{FULLTEXT}.  @code{FULLTEXT} indexes are used with @code{MyISAM} tables
only and can be created from @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR},
or @code{TEXT} columns at @code{CREATE TABLE} time or added later with
@code{ALTER TABLE} or @code{CREATE INDEX}.  For large datasets, it will be
much faster to load your data into a table that has no @code{FULLTEXT}
index, then create the index with @code{ALTER TABLE} (or
@code{CREATE INDEX}).  Loading data into a table that already has a
@code{FULLTEXT} index could be significantly slower.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Constraints on full-text searching are listed in @ref{Fulltext Restrictions}.

@end table

Full-text searching is performed with the @code{MATCH()} function.

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (

@end example

The @code{MATCH()} function performs a natural language search for a string
against a text collection. A collection is a set of one or more columns
included in a @code{FULLTEXT} index.  The search string is given as the
argument to @code{AGAINST()}.  The search is performed in case-insensitive
fashion.  For every row in the table, @code{MATCH()} returns a relevance
value, that is, a similarity measure between the search string and the text
in that row in the columns named in the @code{MATCH()} list.

When @code{MATCH()} is used in a @code{WHERE} clause, as in the preceding
example,
the rows returned are automatically sorted with the highest relevance first.
Relevance values are non-negative floating-point numbers.  Zero relevance
means no similarity.  Relevance is computed based on the number of words
in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the total number of
words in the collection, and the number of documents (rows) that contain
a particular word.

For natural-language full-text searches, it is a requirement that the
columns named in the @code{MATCH()} function be the same columns included in
some @code{FULLTEXT} index in your table.  For the preceding query, note
that the columns named in the @code{MATCH()} function (@code{title} and
@code{body}) are the same as those named in the definition of the
@code{article} table's @code{FULLTEXT} index.  If you wanted to search the
@code{title} or @code{body} separately, you would need to create
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes for each column.

It is also possible to perform a boolean search or a search with query
expansion.  These search types are described in @ref{Fulltext Boolean} and
@ref{Fulltext Query Expansion}.

The preceding example is a basic illustration showing how to use the
@code{MATCH()} function where rows are returned in order of decreasing
relevance.  The next example shows how to retrieve the relevance values
explicitly.  Returned rows are not ordered because the @code{SELECT}
statement includes neither @code{WHERE} nor @code{ORDER BY} clauses:

@example
mysql> SELECT id, MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('Tutorial')
    -> FROM articles;
+----+-----------------------------------------+
| id | MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('Tutorial') |
+----+-----------------------------------------+
|  1 |                        0.65545833110809 |
|  2 |                                       0 |
|  3 |                        0.66266459226608 |
|  4 |                                       0 |
|  5 |                                       0 |
|  6 |                                       0 |
+----+-----------------------------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

The following example is more complex.  The query returns the relevance values
and it also sorts the rows in order of decreasing relevance. To achieve
this result, you should specify @code{MATCH()} twice: once in the
@code{SELECT} list and once in the @code{WHERE} clause. This causes no
additional overhead, because the MySQL optimizer notices that the
two @code{MATCH()} calls are identical and invokes the full-text search
code only once.

@end example

MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A ``word'' is any
sequence of characters consisting of letters, digits, @samp{'}, or @samp{_}.
Some words are ignored in full-text searches:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Any word that is too short is ignored.  The default minimum length of
words that will be found by full-text searches is four characters.

@item
Words in the stopword list are ignored.  A stopword is a word such as
``the'' or ``some'' that is so common that it is considered to have zero
semantic value.  There is a built-in stopword list.

@end itemize

The default minimum word length and stopword list can be changed as
described in @ref{Fulltext Fine-tuning}.

@c TODO: what is a "correct" word? A non-ignored word?

Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted
according to its significance in the collection or query.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents has a lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Conversely, if the word is rare, it receives a
higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute the
relevance of the row.

Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not adequately reflect their semantic value, and this model
may sometimes produce bizarre results. For example, although the word
``MySQL'' is present in every row of the @code{articles} table, a search for
the word produces no results:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
Empty set (0.00 sec)
@end example

The search result is empty because the word ``MySQL'' is present in at least
50% of the rows.  As such, it is effectively treated as a stopword.
For large datasets, this is the most desirable behavior---a natural language
query should not return every second row from a 1GB table. For small datasets,
it may be less desirable.

A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate relevant
documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of irrelevant documents.
We all know this happens far too often when we are trying to find something on
the Internet with a search engine.  It is with this reasoning that rows
containing the word are assigned a low semantic value for @emph{the
particular dataset in which they occur}.  A given word may exceed the 50%
threshold in one dataset but not another.

The 50% threshold has a significant implication when you first try
full-text searching to see how it works: If you create a table and insert only
one or two rows of text into it, every word in the text occurs in at least
50% of the rows. As a result, no search returns any results. Be sure to
insert at least three rows, and preferably many more.

@subsection Boolean Full-Text Searches

As of Version 4.0.1, MySQL can also perform boolean full-text searches using
the @code{IN BOOLEAN MODE} modifier.

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('+MySQL -YourSQL' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
+----+-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| id | title                 | body                                |

|  6 | MySQL Security        | When configured properly, MySQL ... |
+----+-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
@end example

This query retrieves all the rows that contain the word ``MySQL''
but that do @emph{not} contain
the word ``YourSQL''.

Boolean full-text searches have these characteristics:

@itemize @bullet
@item
They do not use the 50% threshold.

@item
They do not automatically sort rows in order of decreasing relevance.  You
can see this from the preceding query result: The row with the highest
relevance is the one that contains ``MySQL'' twice, but it is listed last,
not first.

@item
They can work even without a @code{FULLTEXT} index, although this would be
@emph{slow}.

@end itemize

The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

@c Note: the operators are listed here in the order in
@c which they appear in the ft_boolean_syntax variable
@c (default value: + -><()~*:""&|)
@c Exceptions:
@c - The third item (no operator) that corresponds to the
@c   space is in the second position of the ft_boolean_syntax
@c   value.
@c - The :, &, and | characters are omitted from the
@c - following list.

@table @code

@item +
A leading plus sign indicates that this word @emph{must be}
present in every row returned.

@item -
A leading minus sign indicates that this word @emph{must not be}
present in any row returned.

@item (no operator)
By default (when neither @code{+} nor @code{-} is specified) the word is optional,
but the rows that contain it will be rated higher. This mimics the
behavior of @code{MATCH() ... AGAINST()} without the @code{IN BOOLEAN
MODE} modifier.

@item > <
These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the
relevance value that is assigned to a row.  The @code{>} operator
increases the contribution and the @code{<} operator decreases it.
See the example below.

@item ( )
Parentheses are used to group words into subexpressions.
Parenthesized groups can be nested.

@item ~
A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's
contribution to the row relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking
noise words. A row that contains such a word will be rated lower than
others, but will not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the
@code{-} operator.

@item *
An asterisk is the truncation operator. Unlike the other operators, it
should be @emph{appended} to the word, not prepended.

@item "
A phrase that is enclosed within double quote (@samp{"}) characters matches only
rows that contain the phrase @emph{literally, as it was typed}.

@end table

The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use boolean
full-text operators:

@table @code

@item 'apple banana'
Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.

@item '+apple +juice'
Find rows that contain both words.

@item '+apple macintosh'
Find rows that contain the
word ``apple'', but rank rows higher if they also contain ``macintosh''.

@item '+apple -macintosh'
Find rows that contain the
word ``apple'' but not ``macintosh''.

@item '+apple +(>turnover <strudel)'
Find rows that contain the words
``apple'' and ``turnover'', or ``apple'' and ``strudel'' (in any
order), but rank ``apple turnover'' higher than ``apple strudel''.

@item 'apple*'
Find rows that contain words such as
``apple'', ``apples'', ``applesauce'', or ``applet''.

@item '"some words"'
Find rows that contain the exact phrase ``some words'' (for example, rows
that contain ``some words of wisdom'' but not ``some noise words'').  Note
that the @samp{"} characters that surround the phrase are operator characters
that delimit the phrase.
They are not the quotes that surround the search string
itself.

@end table


@node Fulltext Query Expansion, Fulltext Restrictions, Fulltext Boolean, Fulltext Search
@subsection Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion

As of MySQL 4.1.1, full-text search supports query expansion (in particular,
its variant ``blind query expansion''). This is generally useful when a search
phrase is too short, which often means that the user is relying on implied
knowledge that the full-text search engine usually lacks. For example, a user
searching for ``database'' may really mean that ``MySQL'', ``Oracle'',
``DB2'', and ``RDBMS'' all are phrases that should match
``databases'' and should be returned, too. This is implied knowledge.

Blind query expansion (also known as automatic relevance feedback) is
enabled by adding @code{WITH QUERY EXPANSION} following the search phrase.
It works by performing the search twice, where the search phrase for the
second search is the original search phrase concatenated with the few top
found documents from the first search.  Thus, if one of these documents
contains the word ``databases'' and the word ``MySQL'', the second search
will find the documents that contain the word ``MySQL'' even if they do not
contain the word ``database''.  The following example shows this difference:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('database');
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| id | title             | body                                     |

@end example

Another example could be searching for books by Georges Simenon about
Maigret, when a user is not sure how to spell ``Maigret''. A search for
``Megre and the reluctant witnesses'' will find only ``Maigret and the
Reluctant Witnesses'' without query expansion.  A search with query
expansion will find all books with the word ``Maigret'' on the second pass.

Note: Because blind query expansion tends to increase noise significantly
by returning non-relevant documents, it's only meaningful to use when a
search phrase is rather short.

@subsection Full-Text Restrictions

@itemize @bullet
@item
Full-text searches are supported for @code{MyISAM} tables only.
@item
As of MySQL 4.1.1, full-text searches can be used with most multi-byte
character sets. The exception is that for Unicode, the @code{utf8} character
set can be used, but not the @code{ucs2} character set.
@item
As of MySQL 4.1, the use of multiple character sets within a single table
is supported. However, all columns in a @code{FULLTEXT} index must have
the same character set and collation.
@item
The @code{MATCH()} column list must exactly match the column list in some
@code{FULLTEXT} index definition for the table, unless this @code{MATCH()}
is @code{IN BOOLEAN MODE}.
@item
The argument to @code{AGAINST()} must be a constant string.
@end itemize

@subsection Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search

The MySQL full-text search capability has few user-tunable parameters yet,
although adding more is very high on the TODO.  You can exert more control
over full-text searching behavior if you have a MySQL source distribution
because some changes require source code modfications.
@xref{Installing source}.

Note that full-text search was carefully tuned for the best searching
effectiveness.  Modifying the default behavior will, in most cases,
make the search results worse.  Do not alter the MySQL sources
unless you know what you are doing!

Most full-text variables described in the following items must be set at
server startup time. For these variables, a server restart is required to
change them and you cannot modify them dynamically while the server is
running.

Some variable changes require that you rebuild the @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
in your tables. Instructions for doing this are given at the end of this
section.

@itemize @bullet

@item
The minimum and maximum length of words to be indexed is defined by the
@code{ft_min_word_len} and @code{ft_max_word_len} system variables
(available as of MySQL 4.0.0).
@xref{Server system variables}.
The default minimum value is four characters.  The default maximum depends
on your version of MySQL. If you change either value, you must rebuild your
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes.  For example, if you want three-character words to
be searchable, you can set the @code{ft_min_word_len} variable by putting
the following lines in an option file:

@example
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3
@end example

Then restart the server and rebuild your @code{FULLTEXT} indexes.
Also note particularly the remarks regarding @code{myisamchk} in the
instructions following this list.

@item
To override the default stopword list, set the @code{ft_stopword_file}
system variable (available as of MySQL 4.0.10).
@xref{Server system variables}.
The variable value should be the pathname of the file containing the stopword
list, or the empty string to disable stopword filtering. After changing the value, rebuild your @code{FULLTEXT} indexes.

@item
The 50% threshold for natural language searches is determined by the
particular weighting scheme chosen.  To disable it, look for the following
line in @file{myisam/ftdefs.h}:

@example
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
@end example

Change the line to this:

@example
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
@end example

Then recompile MySQL.
There is no need to rebuild the indexes in this case.
@strong{Note:} By doing this you @emph{severely} decrease MySQL's ability
to provide adequate relevance values for the @code{MATCH()} function.
If you really need to search for such common words, it would be better to
search using @code{IN BOOLEAN MODE} instead, which does not observe the 50%
threshold.

@item
To change the operators used for boolean full-text searches, set the
@code{ft_boolean_syntax} system variable (available as of MySQL 4.0.1).  The
variable also can be changed while the server is running, but you must have
the @code{SUPER} privilege to do so.
No index rebuilding is necessary.
@ref{Server system variables} describes the rules that define how to set this
variable.

@end itemize

If you modify full-text variables that affect indexing
(@code{ft_min_word_len}, @code{ft_max_word_len}, or
@code{ft_stopword_file}), you must rebuild your @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
after making the changes and restarting the server. To rebuild the indexes
in this case, it's sufficient to do a @code{QUICK} repair operation:

@example
mysql> REPAIR TABLE tbl_name QUICK;
@end example

With regard specifically to using the @code{IN BOOLEAN MODE} capability, if
you upgrade from MySQL 3.23 to 4.0 or later, it's necessary to replace the
index header as well.  To do this, do a @code{USE_FRM} repair operation:

@example
mysql> REPAIR TABLE tbl_name USE_FRM;
@end example

This is necessary because boolean full-text searches require a flag in the
index header that was not present in MySQL 3.23, and that is not added if
you do only a @code{QUICK} repair.  If you attempt a boolean full-text
search without rebuilding the indexes this way, the search will return
incorrect results.

Note that if you use @code{myisamchk} to perform an operation that modifies
table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
are rebuilt using the default full-text parameter values for minimum and
maximum word length and the stopword file unless you specify otherwise.
This can result in queries failing.

The problem occurs because these parameters are known only by the server.
They are not stored in @code{MyISAM} index files.  To avoid the problem if
you have modified the minimum or maximum word length or the stopword file in
the server, specify the same @code{ft_min_word_len}, @code{ft_max_word_len},
and @code{ft_stopword_file} values to @code{myisamchk} that you use for
@code{mysqld}. For example, if you have set the minimum word length to 3,
you can repair a table with @code{myisamchk} like this:

@example
shell> myisamchk --recover --ft_min_word_len=3 tbl_name.MYI
@end example

To ensure that @code{myisamchk} and the server use the same values for
full-text parameters, you can place each one in both the @code{[mysqld]}
and @code{[myisamchk]} sections of an option file:

@example
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3

[myisamchk]
ft_min_word_len=3
@end example

An alternative to using @code{myisamchk} is to use the @code{REPAIR TABLE},
@code{ANALYZE TABLE}, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}, or @code{ALTER TABLE}.
These statements are performed by the server, which knows the proper
full-text parameter values to use.

@findex CAST
@findex CONVERT

@c description_for_help_topic CAST  CONVERT SIGNED UNSIGNED BINARY CHAR DATE DATETIME TIME
The @code{CAST()} and @code{CONVERT()} functions may be used to take a
value of one type and produce a value of another type.

The @code{type} can be one of the following values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{BINARY}
@item
@code{CHAR}
@item
@code{DATE}
@item
@code{DATETIME}
@item
@code{SIGNED [INTEGER]}
@item
@code{TIME}
@item
@code{UNSIGNED [INTEGER]}
@end itemize

@code{CAST()} and @code{CONVERT()} are available as of MySQL 4.0.2.
The @code{CHAR} conversion type is available as of 4.0.6.
The @code{USING} form of @code{CONVERT()} is available as of 4.1.0.

@code{CAST()} and @code{CONVERT(... USING ...)} are standard SQL syntax.
The non-@code{USING} form of @code{CONVERT()} is ODBC syntax.

@code{CONVERT()} with @code{USING} is used to convert data between different
character sets.  In MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the
corresponding character set names.  For example, this statement converts
the string @code{'abc'} in the server's default character set to the
corresponding string in the @code{utf8} character set:

@example
SELECT CONVERT('abc' USING utf8);
@end example

@end table

The cast functions are useful when you want to create a column with
a specific type in a @code{CREATE ... SELECT} statement:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@example
CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT CAST('2000-01-01' AS DATE);
@end example

The functions also can be useful for sorting @code{ENUM} columns in lexical
order. Normally sorting of @code{ENUM} columns occurs using the internal
numeric values. Casting the values to @code{CHAR} results in a lexical
sort:

@c example_for_help_topic CAST
@example
SELECT enum_col FROM tbl_name ORDER BY CAST(enum_col AS CHAR);
@end example

@code{CAST(str AS BINARY)} is the same thing as @code{BINARY str}.
@code{CAST(expr AS CHAR)} treats the expression as a string with the
default character set.

@strong{Note:} In MysQL 4.0, a @code{CAST()} to @code{DATE},
@code{DATETIME}, or @code{TIME} only marks the column to be a specific
type but doesn't change the value of the column.

As of MySQL 4.1.0, the value is converted to the correct column type when
it's sent to the user (this is a feature of how the new protocol in 4.1
sends date information to the client):

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST(NOW() AS DATE);
       -> 2003-05-26
@end example

As of MySQL 4.1.1, @code{CAST()}
also changes the result if you use it as part of a more complex expression
such as @code{CONCAT('Date: ',CAST(NOW() AS DATE))}.

You should not use @code{CAST()} to extract data in different formats but
instead use string functions like @code{LEFT()} or
@code{EXTRACT()}. @xref{Date and time functions}.

To cast a string to a numeric value, you don't normally have to do
anything. Just use the string value as though it were a number:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1+'1';
       -> 2
@end example

If you use a number in string context, the number automatically is
converted to a @code{BINARY} string.

@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('hello you ',2);
        -> 'hello you 2'
@end example

MySQL supports arithmetic with both signed and unsigned 64-bit values.
If you are using numerical operators (such as @code{+}) and one of the
operands is an unsigned integer, the result is unsigned.
You can override this by using the @code{SIGNED} and @code{UNSIGNED}
cast operators to cast the operation to a signed or
unsigned 64-bit integer, respectively.

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED)
        -> 18446744073709551615
mysql> SELECT CAST(CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED) AS SIGNED);
        -> -1
@end example

Note that if either operand is a floating-point value, the result is
a floating-point value and is not affected by the preceding rule.
(In this context, @code{DECIMAL} column values are regarded as
floating-point values.)

@example
mysql> SELECT CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) - 2.0;
        -> -1.0
@end example

If you are using a string in an arithmetic operation, this is converted
to a floating-point number.

The handing of unsigned values was changed in MySQL 4.0 to be able to
support @code{BIGINT} values properly. If you have some code that you
want to run in both MySQL 4.0 and 3.23, you probably can't
use the @code{CAST()} function. You can use the following technique to get
a signed result when subtracting two unsigned integer columns @code{ucol1} and
@code{ucol2}:

@example
mysql> SELECT (ucol1+0.0)-(ucol2+0.0) FROM ...;
@end example

The idea is that the columns are converted to floating-point values before
the subtraction occurs.

If you have a problem with @code{UNSIGNED} columns in old MySQL
applications when porting them to MySQL 4.0, you can use the
@code{--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION} option when starting
@code{mysqld}.  However, as long as you use this option, you will not
be able to make efficient use of the @code{BIGINT UNSIGNED} column type.

@subsection Encryption Functions

@findex encryption functions
@findex functions, encryption
@c help_category Encryption Functions@Functions

The functions in this section encrypt and decrypt data values.
If you want to store results from an encryption function that might contain
arbitrary byte values, use a @code{BLOB} column rather than a @code{CHAR}
or @code{VARCHAR} column to avoid potential problems with trailing
space removal that would change data values.

@table @code

@c description_for_help_topic AES_DECRYPT  AES_ENCRYPT
@item AES_ENCRYPT(str,key_str)
@itemx AES_DECRYPT(crypt_str,key_str)
@findex AES_ENCRYPT()
@findex AES_DECRYPT()
These functions allow encryption and decryption of data using the official
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, previously known as "Rijndael."
Encoding with a 128-bit key length is used, but you can extend it up to
256 bits by modifying the source. We chose 128 bits because it is much
faster and it is usually secure enough.

The input arguments may be any length. If either argument is @code{NULL},
the result of this function is also @code{NULL}.

Because AES is a block-level algorithm, padding is used to encode uneven length
strings and so the result string length may be calculated as
@code{16*(trunc(string_length/16)+1)}.

If @code{AES_DECRYPT()} detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it
returns @code{NULL}. However, it is possible for @code{AES_DECRYPT()}
to return a non-@code{NULL} value (possibly garbage) if the input data or
the key is invalid.

You can use the AES functions to store data in an encrypted form by
modifying your queries:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic AES_DECRYPT
@example
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text','password'));
@end example

You can get even more security by not transferring the key over the
connection for each query, which can be accomplished by storing it in a
server-side variable at connection time. For example:
@example
SELECT @@password:='my password';
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text',@@password));
@end example

@code{AES_ENCRYPT()} and @code{AES_DECRYPT()} were added in MySQL 4.0.2,
and can be considered the most cryptographically secure encryption
functions currently available in MySQL.

@c description_for_help_topic DECODE
@item DECODE(crypt_str,pass_str)
@findex DECODE()
Decrypts the encrypted string @code{crypt_str} using @code{pass_str} as the
password.  @code{crypt_str} should be a string returned from
@code{ENCODE()}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic ENCODE
@item ENCODE(str,pass_str)
@findex ENCODE()
Encrypt @code{str} using @code{pass_str} as the password.
To decrypt the result, use @code{DECODE()}.

The result is a binary string of the same length as @code{str}.
If you want to save it in a column, use a @code{BLOB} column type.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic DES_DECRYPT
@item DES_DECRYPT(crypt_str[,key_str])
@findex DES_DECRYPT()

Decrypts a string encrypted with @code{DES_ENCRYPT()}.
On error, this function returns @code{NULL}.

Note that this function works only if MySQL has been configured with
SSL support. @xref{Secure connections}.

If no @code{key_str} argument is given, @code{DES_DECRYPT()} examines
the first byte of the encrypted string to determine the DES key number
that was used to encrypt the original string, and then reads the key
from the DES key file to decrypt the message.  For this to work,
the user must have the @code{SUPER} privilege. The key file can be specified
with the @code{--des-key-file} server option.

If you pass this function a @code{key_str} argument, that string
is used as the key for decrypting the message.

If the @code{crypt_str} argument doesn't look like an encrypted string,
MySQL will return the given @code{crypt_str}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{DES_DECRYPT()} was added in MySQL 4.0.1.

@c description_for_help_topic DES_ENCRYPT
@item DES_ENCRYPT(str[,(key_num|key_str)])
@findex DES_ENCRYPT()

Encrypts the string with the given key using the Triple-DES algorithm.
On error, this function returns @code{NULL}.

Note that this function works only if MySQL has been configured with
SSL support. @xref{Secure connections}.

The encryption key to use is chosen based on the second argument to
@code{DES_ENCRYPT()}, if one was given:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .65
@item @strong{Argument} @tab @strong{Description}
@item No argument @tab
The first key from the DES key file is used.
@item @code{key_num} @tab
The given key number (0-9) from the DES key file is used.
@item @code{key_str} @tab
The given key string is used to encrypt @code{str}.
@end multitable

The key file can be specified with the @code{--des-key-file} server option.

The return string is a binary string where the first character
is @code{CHAR(128 | key_num)}.

The 128 is added to make it easier to recognize an encrypted key.
If you use a string key, @code{key_num} will be 127.

The string length for the result will be
@code{new_len = orig_len + (8-(orig_len % 8))+1}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The DES key file has the following format:

@c example_for_help_topic DES_ENCRYPT
@example
key_num des_key_str
key_num des_key_str
@end example

Each @code{key_num} must be a number in the range from @code{0} to @code{9}.  Lines in
the file may be in any order.  @code{des_key_str} is the string that
will be used to encrypt the message.  Between the number and the key there
should be at least one space.  The first key is the default key that is
used if you don't specify any key argument to @code{DES_ENCRYPT()}

You can tell MySQL to read new key values from the key file with the
@code{FLUSH DES_KEY_FILE} command.  This requires the @code{RELOAD}
privilege.

One benefit of having a set of default keys is that it gives applications
a way to check for the existence of encrypted column values, without giving
the end user the right to decrypt those values.

@example
mysql> SELECT customer_address FROM customer_table WHERE
       crypted_credit_card = DES_ENCRYPT('credit_card_number');
@end example

@code{DES_ENCRYPT()} was added in MySQL 4.0.1.

@c description_for_help_topic ENCRYPT
@item ENCRYPT(str[,salt])
@findex ENCRYPT()
Encrypt @code{str} using the Unix @code{crypt()} system call. The
@code{salt} argument should be a string with two characters.
(As of MySQL 3.22.16, @code{salt} may be longer than two characters.)
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic ENCRYPT
@example
mysql> SELECT ENCRYPT('hello');
        -> 'VxuFAJXVARROc'
@end example

@code{ENCRYPT()} ignores all but the first eight characters of @code{str}, at
least on some systems.  This behavior is determined by the implementation
of the underlying @code{crypt()} system call.

If @code{crypt()} is not available on your system, @code{ENCRYPT()} always
returns @code{NULL}.  Because of this, we recommend that you use @code{MD5()}
or @code{SHA1()} instead, because those two functions exist on all platforms.

@c description_for_help_topic MD5
@item MD5(str)
@findex MD5()
Calculates an MD5 128-bit checksum for the string. The value is returned
as a string of 32 hex digits,
or @code{NULL} if the argument was @code{NULL}.
The return value can, for example, be used as a hash key.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic MD5
@example
mysql> SELECT MD5('testing');
        -> 'ae2b1fca515949e5d54fb22b8ed95575'
@end example

This is the "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm."

@code{MD5()} was added in MySQL 3.23.2.

@c description_for_help_topic OLD_PASSWORD
@item OLD_PASSWORD(str)
@findex OLD_PASSWORD()


@code{OLD_PASSWORD()} is available as of MySQL 4.1, when the implementation of
@code{PASSWORD()} was changed to improve security. @code{OLD_PASSWORD()}
returns the value of the pre-4.1 implementation of @code{PASSWORD()}.
@ref{Password hashing}.

@c description_for_help_topic PASSWORD
@item PASSWORD(str)
@findex PASSWORD()
Calculates and returns a password string from the plaintext password
@code{str}, or @code{NULL} if the argument was @code{NULL}. This is
the function that is used for encrypting MySQL passwords for storage
in the @code{Password} column of the @code{user} grant table.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic PASSWORD

@end example

@cindex password encryption, reversibility of
@code{PASSWORD()} encryption is one-way (not reversible).

@code{PASSWORD()} does not perform password encryption in the same way that
Unix passwords are encrypted. See @code{ENCRYPT()}.

@strong{Note:}
The @code{PASSWORD()} function is used by the authentication system in
MySQL Server, you should @emph{not} use it in your own applications.
For that purpose, use @code{MD5()} or @code{SHA1()} instead.

@c description_for_help_topic SHA  SHA1
@item SHA1(str)
@itemx SHA(str)
@findex SHA1()
@findex SHA()
Calculates an SHA1 160-bit checksum for the string, as described in
RFC 3174 (Secure Hash Algorithm). The value is returned as a string of 40 hex
digits, or @code{NULL} if the argument was @code{NULL}.
One of the possible uses for this function is as a hash key. You can
also use it as a cryptographically safe function for storing passwords.

@c end_description_for_help_topic
@c example_for_help_topic SHA

@code{SHA1()} was added in MySQL 4.0.2, and can be considered
a cryptographically more secure equivalent of @code{MD5()}.
@code{SHA()} is synonym for @code{SHA1()}.

repeatedly @code{count} times.  It may be used to time how fast MySQL
processes the expression.  The result value is always @code{0}.  The intended
use is from within the @code{mysql} client, which reports query execution times:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic BENCHMARK
@example
mysql> SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE('hello','goodbye'));
+----------------------------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE('hello','goodbye')) |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                            0 |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (4.74 sec)
@end example

The time reported is elapsed time on the client end, not CPU time on the
server end.  It is advisable to execute @code{BENCHMARK()} several
times, and to interpret the result with regard to how heavily loaded the
server machine is.

@c description_for_help_topic CHARSET
@item CHARSET(str)
@findex CHARSET()
Returns the character set of the string argument.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CHARSET
@example
mysql> SELECT CHARSET('abc');
        -> 'latin1'
mysql> SELECT CHARSET(CONVERT('abc' USING utf8));
        -> 'utf8'
mysql> SELECT CHARSET(USER());
        -> 'utf8'
@end example

@code{CHARSET()} was added in MySQL 4.1.0.

@c description_for_help_topic COERCIBILITY
@item COERCIBILITY(str)
@findex COERCIBILITY()
Returns the collation coercibility value of the string argument.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic COERCIBILITY
@example
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY('abc' COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci);
        -> 0
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY('abc');
        -> 3
mysql> SELECT COERCIBILITY(USER());
        -> 2
@end example

The return values have the following meanings:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .50
@item @strong{Coercibility} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{0} @tab Explicit collation
@item @code{1} @tab No collation
@item @code{2} @tab Implicit collation
@item @code{3} @tab Coercible
@end multitable

Lower values have higher precedence.

@code{COERCIBILITY()} was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

@c description_for_help_topic COLLATION
@item COLLATION(str)
@findex COLLATION()
Returns the collation for the character set of the string argument.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic COLLATION
@example
mysql> SELECT COLLATION('abc');
        -> 'latin1_swedish_ci'
mysql> SELECT COLLATION(_utf8'abc');
        -> 'utf8_general_ci'
@end example

@code{COLLATION()} was added in MySQL 4.1.0.

@c description_for_help_topic CONNECTION_ID
@item CONNECTION_ID()
@findex CONNECTION_ID()
Returns the connection ID (thread ID) for the connection.
Every connection has its own unique ID.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CONNECTION_ID
@example
mysql> SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
        -> 23786
@end example

@code{CONNECTION_ID()} was added in MySQL 3.23.14.

@c description_for_help_topic CURRENT_USER
@item CURRENT_USER()
@findex CURRENT_USER()
Returns the username and hostname combination that the current session was authenticated
as. This value corresponds to the MySQL account that determines your
access privileges. It can be different from the value of @code{USER()}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic CURRENT_USER
@example
mysql> SELECT USER();
        -> 'davida@@localhost'
mysql> SELECT * FROM mysql.user;
ERROR 1044: Access denied for user: '@@localhost' to
database 'mysql'
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_USER();
        -> '@@localhost'
@end example

The example illustrates that although the client specified a username of
@code{davida} (as indicated by the value of the @code{USER()} function),
the server authenticated the client using an anonymous user account (as seen by
the empty username part of the @code{CURRENT_USER()} value). One way this might
occur is that there is no account listed in the grant tables for
@code{davida}.

@code{CURRENT_USER()} was added in MySQL 4.0.6.

@c description_for_help_topic DATABASE
@item DATABASE()
@findex DATABASE()
Returns the default (current) database name.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic DATABASE
@example
mysql> SELECT DATABASE();
        -> 'test'
@end example

If there is no default database, @code{DATABASE()} returns @code{NULL} as
of MySQL 4.1.1, and the empty string before that.


@item FOUND_ROWS()
@findex FOUND_ROWS()
@findex LIMIT
@c description_for_help_topic FOUND_ROWS

A @code{SELECT} statement may include a @code{LIMIT} clause to restrict the
number of rows the server returns to the client.
In some cases, it is desirable to know how many rows the statement would have
returned without the @code{LIMIT}, but without running the statement again.
To get this row count, include a @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} option in the
@code{SELECT} statement, then invoke @code{FOUND_ROWS()} afterward:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic FOUND_ROWS
@example
mysql> SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tbl_name
    -> WHERE id > 100 LIMIT 10;
mysql> SELECT FOUND_ROWS();
@end example

The second @code{SELECT} will return a number indicating how many rows the
first @code{SELECT} would have returned had it been written without the
@code{LIMIT} clause.
(If the preceding @code{SELECT} statement does not include the
@code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} option, then @code{FOUND_ROWS()} may return
a different result when @code{LIMIT} is used than when it is not.)

Note that if you are using @code{SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS}, MySQL must
calculate how many rows are in the full result set.  However, this is
faster than running the query again without @code{LIMIT}, because the result
set need not be sent to the client.

@code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} and @code{FOUND_ROWS()} can be useful in situations
when you want to restrict the number of rows that a query returns, but also
determine the number of rows in the full result set without running the query
again. An example is a Web script that presents a paged display containing
links to the pages that show other sections of a search result. Using
@code{FOUND_ROWS()} allows you to determine how many other pages are needed
for the rest of the result.

The use of @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} and @code{FOUND_ROWS()} is more complex
for @code{UNION} queries than for simple @code{SELECT} statements, because
@code{LIMIT} may occur at multiple places in a @code{UNION}. It may be applied
to individual @code{SELECT} statements in the @code{UNION}, or global to the
@code{UNION} result as a whole.

The intent of @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} for @code{UNION} is that it should
return the row count that would be returned without a global @code{LIMIT}.
The conditions for use of @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} with @code{UNION} are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} keyword must appear in the first @code{SELECT}
of the @code{UNION}.

@item
The value of @code{FOUND_ROWS()} is exact only if @code{UNION ALL} is used.
If @code{UNION} without @code{ALL} is used, duplicate removal occurs and the
value of @code{FOUND_ROWS()} is only approximate.

@item
If no @code{LIMIT} is present in the @code{UNION}, @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS}
is ignored and returns the number of rows in the temporary table that is
created to process the @code{UNION}.

@end itemize

@code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} and @code{FOUND_ROWS()} are available starting
at MySQL 4.0.0.

@c description_for_help_topic LAST_INSERT_ID
@item LAST_INSERT_ID()
@itemx LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)
@findex LAST_INSERT_ID([expr])
Returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into
an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic LAST_INSERT_ID
@example
mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
        -> 195
@end example

The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis. This means the value the function returns to a given
client is the most recent @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value generated by that
client. The value cannot be affected by other clients, even if they generate
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} values of their own. This behavior ensures that you can
retrieve your own ID without concern for the activity of other clients, and
without the need for locks or transactions.

The value of @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} is not changed if you
update the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column of a row with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not @code{NULL} and not @code{0}).

If you insert many rows at the same time with an insert statement,
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} returns the value for the first inserted row.
The reason for this is to make it possible to easily reproduce
the same @code{INSERT} statement against some other server.

If you use @code{INSERT IGNORE} and the record is ignored, the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} counter still is incremented and
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} returns the new value.

@cindex sequence emulation
If @code{expr} is given as an argument to @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()},
the value of the argument is returned by the function and is remembered as the
next value to be returned by @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}.  This can be used
to simulate sequences:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Create a table to hold the sequence counter and initialize it:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE sequence (id INT NOT NULL);
mysql> INSERT INTO sequence VALUES (0);
@end example

@item
Use the table to generate sequence numbers like this:

@example
mysql> UPDATE sequence SET id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id+1);
mysql> SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
@end example

The @code{UPDATE} statement increments the sequence counter and causes the
next call to @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} to return the updated value.
The @code{SELECT} statement retrieves that value.
The C API function
@code{mysql_insert_id()} can also be used to get the value.
@xref{mysql_insert_id,, @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

@end itemize

You can generate sequences without calling @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}, but the
utility of using the function this way is that the ID value is maintained in
the server as the last automatically generated value.
It is multi-user safe because multiple clients can issue the @code{UPDATE}
statement and get their own sequence value with the @code{SELECT} statement
(or @code{mysql_insert_id()}), without affecting or being affected by other
clients that generate their own sequence values.

Note that @code{mysql_insert_id()} is only updated after @code{INSERT}
and @code{UPDATE} statements, so you cannot use the C API function to
retrieve the value for @code{LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)} after executing other
SQL statements like @code{SELECT} or @code{SET}.

@c description_for_help_topic SESSION_USER
@item SESSION_USER()
@findex SESSION_USER()

@code{SESSION_USER()} is a synonym for @code{USER()}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic SYSTEM_USER
@item SYSTEM_USER()
@findex SYSTEM_USER()

@code{SYSTEM_USER()} is a synonym for @code{USER()}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c description_for_help_topic USER
@item USER()
@findex USER()

Returns the current MySQL username and hostname.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic USER
@example
mysql> SELECT USER();
        -> 'davida@@localhost'
@end example

The value indicates the username you specified when connecting to
the server, and the client host from which you connected. The value can be
different than that of @code{CURRENT_USER()}.

Prior to MySQL 3.22.11, the function value does not include the client
hostname.  You can extract just the username part, regardless of whether the
value includes a hostname part, like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),'@@',1);
        -> 'davida'
@end example

As of MySQL 4.1, @code{USER()} returns a value in the @code{utf8} character
set, so you should also make sure that the @code{'@@'} string literal is
interpreted in that character set:

@example
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(USER(),_utf8'@@',1);
        -> 'davida'
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic VERSION
@item VERSION()
@findex VERSION()
Returns a string that indicates the MySQL server version.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic VERSION
@example
mysql> SELECT VERSION();
        -> '4.1.2-alpha-log'
@end example

Note that if your version string ends with @code{-log} this means that
logging is enabled.

@c description_for_help_topic GET_LOCK
@item GET_LOCK(str,timeout)
@cindex timeout
@findex GET_LOCK()
Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string @code{str}, with a
timeout of @code{timeout} seconds.  Returns @code{1} if the lock was obtained
successfully, @code{0} if the attempt timed out (for example, because another
client has already locked the name), or @code{NULL} if an error
occurred (such as running out of memory or the thread was killed with
@code{mysqladmin kill}).  If you have a lock obtained with @code{GET_LOCK()},
it is released when you execute
@code{RELEASE_LOCK()}, execute a new @code{GET_LOCK()}, or your connection
terminates (either normally or abnormally).

This function can be used to implement application locks or to
simulate record locks.  Names are locked on a server-wide basis.
If a name has been locked by one client, @code{GET_LOCK()} blocks
any request by another client for a lock with the same name. This
allows clients that agree on a given lock name to use the name to
perform cooperative advisory locking.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic GET_LOCK
@example
mysql> SELECT GET_LOCK('lock1',10);
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT IS_FREE_LOCK('lock2');

mysql> SELECT GET_LOCK('lock2',10);
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock2');
        -> 1
mysql> SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('lock1');
        -> NULL
@end example

Note that the second @code{RELEASE_LOCK()} call returns @code{NULL} because
the lock @code{'lock1'} was automatically released by the second
@code{GET_LOCK()} call.

@c description_for_help_topic INET_ATON
@item INET_ATON(expr)
@findex INET_ATON()
Given the dotted-quad representation of a network address as a string,
returns an integer that represents the numeric value of the address.
Addresses may be 4- or 8-byte addresses.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic INET_ATON
@example
mysql> SELECT INET_ATON('209.207.224.40');
        -> 3520061480
@end example

The generated number is always in network byte order. For the example
just shown, the number is calculated as @code{209*256^3 + 207*256^2 +
224*256 + 40}.

As of MySQL 4.1.2, @code{INET_ATON()} also understands short-form IP
addresses:

@example
mysql> SELECT INET_ATON('127.0.0.1'), INET_ATON('127.1');
        -> 2130706433, 2130706433

Checks whether the lock named @code{str} is free to use (that is, not locked).
Returns @code{1} if the lock is free (no one is using the lock),
@code{0} if the lock is in use, and
@code{NULL} on errors (such as incorrect arguments).
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{IS_FREE_LOCK()} was added in MySQL 4.0.2.

@c description_for_help_topic IS_USED_LOCK
@item IS_USED_LOCK(str)
@findex IS_USED_LOCK()
Checks whether the lock named @code{str} is in use (that is, locked).
If so, it returns the connection identifier of the client that holds
the lock.
Otherwise, it returns @code{NULL}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{IS_USED_LOCK()} was added in MySQL 4.1.0.


@c description_for_help_topic MASTER_POS_WAIT
@item MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name,log_pos[,timeout])
@findex MASTER_POS_WAIT()

This function is useful for control of master/slave synchronization.
It blocks until the slave has read and applied all updates up to the specified
position in the master log.
The return value is the number of log events it had to wait for to get to
the specified position.  The function returns @code{NULL} if the slave's
master information is not initialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an
error occurs. It returns @code{-1} if the timeout has been exceeded.

If the slave thread is not running, this function will block and wait until
the slave is started and goes to or past the specified position. If the
slave is already past the specified position, the function returns
immediately.  @c end_description_for_help_topic

If a @code{timeout} value is specified, @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()}
stops waiting when @code{timeout} seconds have elapsed. @code{timeout} must
be greater than 0; a zero or negative @code{timeout} means no timeout.

@code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} was added in MySQL 3.23.32.
The @code{timeout} argument was added in 4.0.10.

@c description_for_help_topic RELEASE_LOCK
@item RELEASE_LOCK(str)
@findex RELEASE_LOCK()
Releases the lock named by the string @code{str} that was obtained with

lock wasn't locked by this thread (in which case the lock is not released),
and @code{NULL} if the named lock didn't exist.  The lock will not exist if
it was never obtained by a call to @code{GET_LOCK()} or if it already has
been released.

The @code{DO} statement is convenient to use with @code{RELEASE_LOCK()}.

@c description_for_help_topic UUID
@item UUID()
@findex UUID()

Returns a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) generated
according to ``DCE 1.1: Remote Procedure Call'' (Appendix A)
CAE (Common Applications Environment) Specifications
published by The Open Group in October 1997 (Document Number C706).

A UUID is designed as a number that is globally unique in space and
time. Two calls to @code{UUID()} are expected to generate two different
values, even if these calls are performed on two separate computers that are
not connected to each other.

A UUID is a 128-bit number represented by a string
of five hexadecimal numbers in @code{aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee}
format:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The first three numbers are generated from a timestamp.

@item
The fourth number preserves temporal uniqueness in case the timestamp value loses
monotonicity (for example, due to daylight saving time).

@item
The fifth number is an IEEE 802 node number that provides spatial uniqueness.  A
random number is substituted if the latter is not available (for example,
because the host computer has no Ethernet card, or we do not know how to
find the hardware address of an interface on your operating system).  In
this case, spatial uniqueness cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a
collision should have @emph{very} low probability.

Currently, the MAC address of an interface is taken into account only on
FreeBSD and Linux. On other operating systems, MySQL uses a randomly generated
48-bit number.

@c description_for_help_topic COUNT

@c example_for_help_topic COUNT
@example
mysql> SELECT student.student_name,COUNT(*)

    ->        GROUP BY student_name;

@end example

@code{COUNT(*)} is somewhat different in that it returns a count of
the number of rows retrieved, whether or not they contain @code{NULL}
values.

@code{COUNT(*)} is optimized to
return very quickly if the @code{SELECT} retrieves from one table, no
other columns are retrieved, and there is no @code{WHERE} clause.
For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student;
@end example

This optimization applies only to @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables
only, because an exact record count is stored for these table types and
can be accessed very quickly. For transactional storage engines
(@code{InnoDB}, @code{BDB}), storing an exact row count is more problematic
because multiple transactions may be occurring, each of which may affect the
count.

@c description_for_help_topic COUNT DISTINCT  COUNT DISTINCT

In MySQL, you can get the number of distinct expression

    ->     GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT test_score
    ->               ORDER BY test_score DESC SEPARATOR ' ')
    ->     FROM student
    ->     GROUP BY student_name;
@end example

In MySQL, you can get the concatenated values of expression combinations.
You can eliminate duplicate values by using @code{DISTINCT}.
If you want to sort values in the result, you should use @code{ORDER BY}
clause.
To sort in reverse order, add the @code{DESC} (descending) keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by in the @code{ORDER BY} clause. The
default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using the
@code{ASC} keyword.
@code{SEPARATOR} is followed by the string value that should be inserted between
values of result. The default is a comma (@samp{,}). You can remove
the separator altogether by specifying @code{SEPARATOR ''}.

You can set a maximum allowed length with the
@code{group_concat_max_len} system variable.
The syntax to do this at runtime is as follows, where @code{val} is an
unsigned integer:

@example
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] group_concat_max_len = val;
@end example

If a maximum length has been set, the result is truncated to this
maximum length. 

@c commented out until someone can say what GROUP_CONCAT() can do that
@c LIST() cannot...
@c The @code{GROUP_CONCAT()} function is an enhanced implementation of
@c the basic @code{LIST()} function supported by Sybase SQL Anywhere.
@c @code{GROUP_CONCAT()} is backward compatible with the extremely limited
@c functionality of @code{LIST()} if only one column and no other options
@c are specified. @code{LIST()} does have a default sorting order.

Note: There are still some small limitations with @code{GROUP_CONCAT()}
when it comes to using @code{DISTINCT} together with @code{ORDER BY} and using
@code{BLOB} values. See @ref{Open bugs}.

@code{GROUP_CONCAT()} was added in MySQL 4.1.

For @code{MIN()}, @code{MAX()}, and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares @code{ENUM} and @code{SET} columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, the @code{GROUP BY} clause allows a @code{WITH
ROLLUP} modifier that causes extra rows to be added to the summary
output. These rows represent higher-level (or super-aggregate) summary
operations. @code{ROLLUP} thus allows you to answer questions at multiple
levels of analysis with a single query. It can be used, for example,
to provide support for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations.

As an illustration, suppose that a table named @code{sales} has @code{year},
@code{country},
@code{product}, and @code{profit} columns for recording sales profitability:

@example
CREATE TABLE sales
(
    year    INT NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    product VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    profit  INT
);
@end example

The table's contents can be summarized per year with a simple @code{GROUP BY}
like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT year, SUM(profit) FROM sales GROUP BY year;
+------+-------------+
| year | SUM(profit) |
+------+-------------+
| 2000 |        4525 |
| 2001 |        3010 |
+------+-------------+
@end example

This output shows the total profit for each year, but if you also want
to determine the total profit summed over all years, you must add up
the individual values yourself or run an additional query.

Or you can use @code{ROLLUP}, which provides both levels of analysis with a
single query.
Adding a @code{WITH ROLLUP} modifier to the @code{GROUP BY} clause causes the query
to produce another row that shows the grand total over all year values:

@example
mysql> SELECT year, SUM(profit) FROM sales GROUP BY year WITH ROLLUP;
+------+-------------+
| year | SUM(profit) |
+------+-------------+
| 2000 |        4525 |
| 2001 |        3010 |
| NULL |        7535 |
+------+-------------+
@end example

The grand total super-aggregate line is identified by the value @code{NULL} in
the @code{year} column.

@code{ROLLUP} has a more complex effect when there are multiple @code{GROUP BY}
columns. In this case, each time there is a ``break'' (change in value)
in any but the last grouping column, the query produces an extra
super-aggregate summary row.

For example, without @code{ROLLUP}, a summary on the @code{sales} table based
on @code{year},
@code{country}, and @code{product} might look like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -> FROM sales
    -> GROUP BY year, country, product;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |         100 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |         150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |        1200 |
| 2000 | USA     | Calculator |          75 |
| 2000 | USA     | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2001 | Finland | Phone      |          10 |
| 2001 | USA     | Calculator |          50 |
| 2001 | USA     | Computer   |        2700 |
| 2001 | USA     | TV         |         250 |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
@end example

The output indicates summary values only at the year/country/product level of
analysis.  When @code{ROLLUP} is added, the query produces several extra rows:

@example
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -> FROM sales
    -> GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |         100 |

| NULL | NULL    | NULL       |        7535 |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
@end example

For this query, adding @code{ROLLUP} causes the output to include summary
information at four levels of analysis, not just one.  Here's how to
interpret the @code{ROLLUP} output:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Following each set of product rows for a given year and country, an
extra summary row is produced showing the total for all products. These rows
have the @code{product} column set to @code{NULL}.

@item
Following each set of rows for a given year, an extra summary row is
produced showing the total for all countries and products. These rows
have the @code{country} and @code{products} columns set to @code{NULL}.

@item
Finally, following all other rows, an extra summary row is produced
showing the grand total for all years, countries, and products. This
row has the @code{year}, @code{country}, and @code{products} columns set to
@code{NULL}.

@end itemize

@strong{Other Considerations When using @code{ROLLUP}}

The following items list some behaviors specific to the MySQL implementation
of @code{ROLLUP}:

When you use @code{ROLLUP}, you cannot also use an @code{ORDER BY} clause to
sort the results. In other words, @code{ROLLUP} and @code{ORDER BY} are mutually
exclusive. However, you still have some control over sort order.
@code{GROUP BY}
in MySQL sorts results, and you can use explicit @code{ASC} and @code{DESC} keywords
with columns named in the @code{GROUP BY} list to specify sort order for
individual columns.  (The higher-level summary rows added by @code{ROLLUP}
still appear after the rows from which they are calculated, regardless
of the sort order.)

@code{LIMIT} can be used to restrict the number of rows returned to the
client. @code{LIMIT} is applied after @code{ROLLUP}, so the limit applies
against the extra rows added by @code{ROLLUP}. For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT year, country, product, SUM(profit)
    -> FROM sales
    -> GROUP BY year, country, product WITH ROLLUP
    -> LIMIT 5;
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| year | country | product    | SUM(profit) |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 2000 | Finland | Computer   |        1500 |
| 2000 | Finland | Phone      |         100 |
| 2000 | Finland | NULL       |        1600 |
| 2000 | India   | Calculator |         150 |
| 2000 | India   | Computer   |        1200 |
+------+---------+------------+-------------+
@end example

Using @code{LIMIT} with @code{ROLLUP} may produce results
that are more difficult to interpret, because you have less context
for understanding the super-aggregate rows.

The @code{NULL} indicators in each super-aggregate row are produced when the
row is sent to the client.  The server looks at the columns named in
the @code{GROUP BY} clause following the leftmost one that has changed value.
For any column in the result set with a name that is a lexical match to
any of those names, its value is set to @code{NULL}.  (If you specify grouping
columns by column number, the server identifies which columns to set to
@code{NULL} by number.)

Because the @code{NULL} values in the super-aggregate rows are placed into the
result set at such a late stage in query processing, you cannot test them
as @code{NULL} values within the query itself.  For example, you cannot add
@code{HAVING product IS NULL} to the query to eliminate from the output all
but the super-aggregate rows.

On the other hand, the @code{NULL} values do appear as @code{NULL}
on the client side and can be tested as such using any MySQL client
programming interface.

@cindex @code{GROUP BY}, extensions to standard SQL
MySQL extends the use of @code{GROUP BY} so that you can use columns or
calculations in the @code{SELECT} list that don't appear in
the @code{GROUP BY} clause. This stands for @emph{any possible value for this
group}.  You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
@code{customer.name} in the following query:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic BIT_AND
@example
mysql> SELECT order.custid, customer.name, MAX(payments)
    ->        FROM order,customer
    ->        WHERE order.custid = customer.custid
    ->        GROUP BY order.custid;
@end example

In standard SQL, you would have to add @code{customer.name} to the
@code{GROUP BY} clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in
ANSI mode.

Do @emph{not} use this feature if the columns you omit from the
@code{GROUP BY} part are not unique in the group!  You will get
unpredictable results.

In some cases, you can use @code{MIN()} and @code{MAX()} to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
@code{column} from the row containing the smallest value in the @code{sort}
column:

@example
SUBSTR(MIN(CONCAT(RPAD(sort,6,' '),column)),7)
@end example

Note that if you are using MySQL 3.22 (or earlier) or if
you are trying to follow standard SQL, you can't use expressions in @code{GROUP

using an alias for the expression:

@example
mysql> SELECT id,FLOOR(value/100) AS val FROM tbl_name
    ->     GROUP BY id, val ORDER BY val;
@end example

In MySQL 3.23 and up, aliases are unnecessary. You can use expressions 
in @code{GROUP BY} and @code{ORDER BY} clauses.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT id, FLOOR(value/100) FROM tbl_name ORDER BY RAND();

@c example_for_help_topic DELETE
Single-table syntax:
@example
DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE] FROM tbl_name
       [WHERE where_definition]
       [ORDER BY ...]
       [LIMIT row_count]
@end example

Multiple-table syntax:

@example
DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]
       tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*] ...]
       FROM table_references
       [WHERE where_definition]
@end example

Or:

@example
DELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]
       FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*] ...]
       USING table_references
       [WHERE where_definition]
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic DELETE  BY ORDER LIMIT WHERE FROM USING LOW_PRIORITY QUICK
@code{DELETE} deletes rows from @code{tbl_name} that satisfy the condition
given by @code{where_definition}, and returns the number of records deleted.

If you issue a @code{DELETE} statement with no @code{WHERE} clause, all
rows are deleted.  A faster way to do this, when you don't want to know
the number of deleted rows, is using @code{TRUNCATE TABLE}. @xref{TRUNCATE}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

In MySQL 3.23, @code{DELETE} without a @code{WHERE} clause returns zero
as the number of affected records.

In MySQL 3.23, if you really want to know how many records are deleted
when you are deleting all rows, and are willing to suffer a speed
penalty, you can use a @code{DELETE} statement that includes a
@code{WHERE} clause with an expression that is true for every row. For
example:

@example
mysql> DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE 1>0;
@end example

This is much slower than @code{TRUNCATE tbl_name}, because it deletes
rows one at a time.

The @code{DELETE} statement supports the following modifiers:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you specify the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} keyword, execution of the
@code{DELETE} is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

@item
For @code{MyISAM} tables, if you specify the @code{QUICK} keyword, the
storage engine does not merge index leaves during delete, which may speed up
certain kind of deletes.

@item
The @code{IGNORE} keyword causes MySQL to ignore all errors during the
process of deleting rows. (Errors encountered during the parsing stage are
processed in the usual manner.) Errors that are ignored due to the use of
this option are returned as warnings. This option first appeared in MySQL
4.1.1.

@end itemize

The speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors discussed in
@ref{Delete speed}.

In @code{MyISAM} tables, deleted records are maintained in a linked list and
subsequent @code{INSERT} operations reuse old record positions. To
reclaim unused space and reduce file sizes, use the @code{OPTIMIZE
TABLE} statement or the @code{myisamchk} utility to reorganize tables.
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} is easier, but @code{myisamchk} is faster.  See
@ref{OPTIMIZE TABLE, , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}} and @ref{Optimisation}.

The MySQL-specific @code{LIMIT row_count} option to @code{DELETE} tells
the server the maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is
returned to the client.  This can be used to ensure that a specific
@code{DELETE} statement doesn't take too much time.  You can simply repeat
the @code{DELETE} statement until the number of affected rows is less than
the @code{LIMIT} value.

If the @code{DELETE} statement includes an @code{ORDER BY} clause, the rows
are deleted in the order specified by the clause. This is really useful only
in conjunction with @code{LIMIT}.  For example, the following statement
finds rows matching the @code{WHERE} clause, sorts them in @code{timestamp}
order, and deletes the first (oldest) one:

@example
DELETE FROM somelog
WHERE user = 'jcole'
ORDER BY timestamp
LIMIT 1
@end example

@code{ORDER BY} can be used with @code{DELETE} beginning with MySQL 4.0.0.

From MySQL 4.0, you can specify multiple tables in the @code{DELETE}
statement to delete rows from one or more tables depending on a particular
condition in multiple tables. However, you cannot use @code{ORDER BY}
or @code{LIMIT} in a multiple-table @code{DELETE}.

The first multiple-table @code{DELETE} syntax is supported starting from
MySQL 4.0.0.  The second is supported starting from MySQL 4.0.2. The
@code{table_references} part lists the tables involved in the join.
Its syntax is described in @ref{JOIN,  , @code{JOIN}}.

For the first syntax, only matching rows from the tables listed before the
@code{FROM} clause are deleted. For the second syntax, only matching rows
from the tables listed in the @code{FROM} clause (before the @code{USING}
clause) are deleted.  The effect is that you can delete rows from many
tables at the same time and also have additional tables that are used for
searching:

@example
DELETE t1,t2 FROM t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id;
@end example

Or:

@example
DELETE FROM t1,t2 USING t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id;
@end example

These statements use all three files when searching for rows to delete, but
delete matching rows only from tables @code{t1} and @code{t2}.

The examples show inner joins using the comma operator, but
multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements can use any type of
join allowed in @code{SELECT} statements, such as @code{LEFT JOIN}.

The syntax allows @code{.*} after the table names for compatibility with
@code{Access}.

If you use a multiple-table @code{DELETE} statement involving
@code{InnoDB} tables for which there are foreign key constraints,
the MySQL optimizer might process tables in an order that differs from
that of their parent/child relationship. In this case, the statement
fails and rolls back. Instead, delete from a single table and rely on the
@code{ON DELETE} capabilities that @code{InnoDB} provides to cause the
other tables to be modified accordingly.

@strong{Note:} In MySQL 4.0, you should refer to the table names to be
deleted with the true table name. In MySQL 4.1, you must use the alias
(if exists) when referring to a table name:

In MySQL 4.0:

@example
DELETE test FROM test AS t1, test2 WHERE ...
@end example

In MySQL 4.1:

@example
DELETE t1 FROM test AS t1, test2 WHERE ...
@end example

The reason we didn't do the above change in 4.0 is because we didn't
want to break any old applications in 4.0 using the old syntax.

it accessible via subsequent @code{HANDLER ... READ} statements.
This table object is not shared by other threads and is not closed
until the thread calls @code{HANDLER ... CLOSE} or the thread terminates.
If you open the table using an alias, further references to the table with
other @code{HANDLER} statements must use the alias rather than the table
name.

The first @code{HANDLER ... READ} syntax fetches a row where the index
specified satisfies the given values and the @code{WHERE} condition is met.
If you have a multiple-column index, specify the index column values as a
comma-separated list. Either specify values for all the columns in the
index, or specify values for a leftmost prefix of the index columns. Suppose
that an index includes three columns named @code{col_a}, @code{col_b}, and
@code{col_c}, in that order.  The @code{HANDLER} statement can specify
values for all three columns in the index, or for the columns in a leftmost
prefix. For example:

@example
HANDLER ... index_name = (col_a_val,col_b_val,col_c_val) ...
HANDLER ... index_name = (col_a_val,col_b_val) ...
HANDLER ... index_name = (col_a_val) ...
@end example

The second @code{HANDLER ... READ} syntax fetches a row from the table in
index order that that matches @code{WHERE} condition.

The third @code{HANDLER ... READ} syntax fetches a row from the table in
natural row order that matches the @code{WHERE} condition. It is faster than
@code{HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name} when a full table scan is desired.
Natural row order is the order in which rows are stored in a @code{MyISAM}
table data file. This statement works for @code{InnoDB} tables as well, but
there is no such concept because there is no separate data file.

Without a @code{LIMIT} clause, all forms of @code{HANDLER ... READ} fetch a
single row if one is available. To return a specific number of rows, include a
@code{LIMIT} clause. It has the same syntax as for the @code{SELECT}
statement.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.

@code{HANDLER ... CLOSE} closes a table that was opened with
@code{HANDLER ... OPEN}.

Note: To use the @code{HANDLER} interface to refer to a table's
@code{PRIMARY KEY}, use the quoted identifier @code{`PRIMARY`}:

@example
HANDLER tbl_name READ `PRIMARY` > (...);
@end example

@code{HANDLER} is a somewhat low-level statement.  For example, it does not
provide consistency.  That is, @code{HANDLER ... OPEN} does @strong{NOT}
take a snapshot of the table, and does @strong{NOT} lock the table. This
means that after a @code{HANDLER ... OPEN} statement is issued, table data
can be modified (by this or any other thread) and these modifications might
appear only partially in @code{HANDLER ... NEXT} or @code{HANDLER ... PREV}
scans.

There are several reasons to use the @code{HANDLER} interface instead of
normal @code{SELECT} statements:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{HANDLER} is faster than @code{SELECT}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A designated storage engine handler object is allocated for the
@code{HANDLER ...  OPEN}. The object is reused for the following
@code{HANDLER} statements for the table; it need not be reinitialized for
each one.

@item
There is less parsing involved.

@item
There is no optimizer or query-checking overhead.

@item
The table doesn't have to be locked between two handler requests.

@item
The handler interface doesn't have to provide a consistent look of the
data (for example, dirty reads are allowed), so the storage engine can
use optimizations that @code{SELECT} doesn't normally allow.

@end itemize

@item

@code{HANDLER} makes it much easier to port applications that use an
@code{ISAM}-like interface to MySQL.

@item
@code{HANDLER} allows you to traverse a database in a manner that is not
easy (or perhaps even impossible) to do with @code{SELECT}. The @code{HANDLER}
interface is a more natural way to look at data when working with
applications that provide an interactive user interface to the database.

@code{INSERT} inserts new rows into an existing table.  The @code{INSERT ...
VALUES} and @code{INSERT ... SET} forms of the statement insert rows based
on explicitly specified values.  The @code{INSERT ... SELECT} form inserts
rows selected from another table or tables.  The @code{INSERT ... VALUES}
form with multiple value lists is supported in MySQL 3.22.5 or
later.  The @code{INSERT ... SET} syntax is supported in MySQL
3.22.10 or later.
@code{INSERT ... SELECT} is discussed further in
@xref{INSERT SELECT,  , @code{INSERT SELECT}}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{tbl_name} is the table into which rows should be inserted. The columns
for which the statement provides values can be specified as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The column name list or the @code{SET} clause indicates the columns
explicitly.

@item
If you do not specify the column list for @code{INSERT ... VALUES} or
@code{INSERT ... SELECT}, values for every column in the table must be
provided in the @code{VALUES()} list or by the @code{SELECT}.  If you don't
know the order of the columns in the table, use @code{DESCRIBE tbl_name} to
find out.

@end itemize

Column values can be given in several ways:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@cindex default values
Any column not explicitly given a value is set to its default value.  For
example, if you specify a column list that doesn't name all the columns in
the table, unnamed columns are set to their default values.  Default value
assignment is described in @ref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

MySQL always has a default value for all columns. This is something
that is imposed on MySQL to be able to work with both transactional
and non-transactional tables.

@c TODO: change next para when STRICT mode is implemented

Our view is that checking of column content should be done in the
application and not in the database server.

Note: If you want @code{INSERT} statements to generate an error unless you
explicitly specify values for all columns that require a non-@code{NULL}
value, you can configure MySQL using the @code{DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS}
option.  This behavior is available only if you compile MySQL from source.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

@item
You can use the keyword @code{DEFAULT} to explicitly set a column to its
default value. (New in MySQL 4.0.3.)  This makes it easier to write
@code{INSERT} statements that assign values to all but a few columns,
because it allows you to avoid writing an incomplete @code{VALUES} list
(a list that does not include a value for each column in the table).
Otherwise, you would have to write out the list of column names
corresponding to each value in the @code{VALUES} list.

If both the column list and the @code{VALUES} list are empty, @code{INSERT}
creates a row with each column set to its default value.

@item
An @code{expression} can refer to any column that was set earlier in a value
list.  For example, you can do this because the value for @code{col2} refers
to @code{col1}, which has already been assigned:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(15,col1*2);
@end example

But you cannot do this because the value for @code{col1} refers to
@code{col2}, which is assigned after @code{col1}:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);
@end example

@end itemize

The @code{INSERT} statement supports the following modifiers:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you specify the @code{DELAYED} keyword, the server puts the row or
rows to be inserted into a buffer, and the client issuing the @code{INSERT
DELAYED} statement then can continue on.  If the table is busy, the server
holds the rows.  When the table becomes free, it begins inserting rows,
checking periodically to see whether there are new read requests for the
table. If there are, the delayed row queue is suspended until the table
becomes free again.
@xref{INSERT DELAYED,  , @code{INSERT DELAYED}}.

@item
If you specify the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} keyword, execution of the
@code{INSERT} is delayed until no other clients are reading from the
table. This includes other clients that began reading while existing
clients are reading, and while the @code{INSERT LOW_PRIORITY} statement
is waiting. It is possible, therefore, for a client that issues an
@code{INSERT LOW_PRIORITY} statement to wait for a very long time (or
even forever) in a read-heavy environment.
(This is in contrast to @code{INSERT DELAYED}, which lets the client
continue at once.)  @xref{INSERT DELAYED,  , @code{INSERT DELAYED}}.  Note
that @code{LOW_PRIORITY} should normally not be used with @code{MyISAM}
tables because doing so disables concurrent inserts.
@xref{MyISAM,  , @code{MyISAM}}.

@item
If you specify the @code{IGNORE} keyword in an @code{INSERT} with many rows,
any rows that duplicate an existing @code{UNIQUE} index or @code{PRIMARY
KEY} value in the table are ignored and are not inserted.  If you do not
specify @code{IGNORE}, the insert is aborted if there is any row that
duplicates an existing key value.  You can determine with the
@code{mysql_info()} C API function how many rows were inserted into the
table.

@end itemize

@c TODO: make ON DUPLICATE stuff a separate subsection?

If you specify the @code{ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE} clause (new in MySQL 4.1.0), and
a row is inserted that would cause a duplicate value in a @code{UNIQUE} index
or
@code{PRIMARY KEY}, an @code{UPDATE} of the old row is performed. For
example,
if column @code{a} is declared as @code{UNIQUE} and already contains the value
@code{1}, the following two statements have identical effect:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
    -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;

mysql> UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1;
@end example

@strong{Note:} If column @code{b} is unique too, the @code{INSERT} would be
equivalent to this @code{UPDATE} statement instead:

@example
mysql> UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1 OR b=2 LIMIT 1;
@end example

If @code{a=1 OR b=2} matches several rows, only @strong{one} row
is updated! In general, you should try to avoid using the
@code{ON DUPLICATE KEY} clause on tables with multiple @code{UNIQUE} keys.

Since MySQL 4.1.1, you can use the @code{VALUES(col_name)} function in the
@code{UPDATE} clause to refer to column values from the @code{INSERT} part
of the @code{INSERT ... UPDATE} statement. In other words,
@code{VALUES(col_name)} in the @code{UPDATE} clause refers to the value of
@code{col_name} that would be inserted if no duplicate-key conflict
occurred. This function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts. The
@code{VALUES()} function is meaningful only in @code{INSERT ... UPDATE}
statements and returns @code{NULL} otherwise.

Example:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
    -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=VALUES(a)+VALUES(b);
@end example

That statement is identical to the following two statements:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
    -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=3;
mysql> INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (4,5,6)
    -> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=9;
@end example

When you use @code{ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE}, the @code{DELAYED} option is
ignored.

@findex LAST_INSERT_ID()
@findex mysql_insert_id()

You can find the value used for an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column by using the
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} function. From within the C API, use the
@code{mysql_insert_id()} function.  However, note that the two functions do
not behave quite identically under all circumstances.
The behavior of @code{INSERT} statements with respect to @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
columns is discussed further in @ref{Information functions} and
@ref{mysql_insert_id, , @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

If you use an @code{INSERT ... VALUES} statement with multiple value lists
or @code{INSERT ... SELECT}, the statement returns an information string in
this format:

@example
Records: 100 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
@end example

@code{Records} indicates the number of rows processed by the statement.
(This is not necessarily the number of rows actually inserted.
@code{Duplicates} can be nonzero.)
@code{Duplicates} indicates the number of rows that couldn't be inserted
because they would duplicate some existing unique index value.
@code{Warnings} indicates the number of attempts to insert column values that
were problematic in some way. Warnings can occur under any of the following
conditions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Inserting @code{NULL} into a column that has been declared @code{NOT NULL}.
For multiple-row @code{INSERT} statements or @code{INSERT ... SELECT}
statements,
the column is set to the default value appropriate for the column type.
This is @code{0} for numeric types, the empty string (@code{''}) for
string types, and the ``zero'' value for date and time types.

@item
Setting a numeric column to a value that lies outside the column's range.
The value is clipped to the closest endpoint of the range.

@item
Assigning a value such as @code{'10.34 a'} to a numeric column.  The
trailing non-numeric text is stripped off and the remaining numeric part is
inserted.  If the string value has no leading numeric part, the column is
set to @code{0}.

@item
Inserting a string into a string column (@code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, @code{TEXT}, or
@code{BLOB}) that exceeds the column's maximum length.  The value is
truncated to the column's maximum length.

@item
Inserting a value into a date or time column that is illegal for the column
type.  The column is set to the appropriate zero value for the type.

The following conditions hold for an @code{INSERT ... SELECT} statement:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Prior to MySQL 4.0.1, @code{INSERT ... SELECT} implicitly operates in
@code{IGNORE} mode.  As of MySQL 4.0.1, specify @code{IGNORE}
explicitly to ignore records that would cause duplicate-key violations.

@item
Do not use @code{DELAYED} with @code{INSERT ... SELECT}.

@item
Prior to MySQL 4.0.14,
the target table of the @code{INSERT} statement cannot appear in the
@code{FROM} clause of the @code{SELECT} part of the query.
This limitation is lifted in 4.0.14.
@c (The problem is that the @code{SELECT} possibly would
@c find records that were inserted earlier during the same run.  When using
@c subquery clauses, the situation could easily be very confusing.)

@item
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns work as usual.

@item
To ensure that the binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
@code{INSERT ... SELECT}.
@end itemize

You can use @code{REPLACE} instead of @code{INSERT} to overwrite old rows.
@code{REPLACE} is the counterpart to @code{INSERT IGNORE} in the treatment
of new rows that contain unique key values that duplicate old rows:

INSERT DELAYED ...
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic INSERT DELAYED  INSERT DELAYED
The @code{DELAYED} option for the @code{INSERT} statement is a
MySQL extension to standard SQL that is very useful if you have clients
that can't wait for the @code{INSERT} to complete.  This is a common
problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also
periodically run @code{SELECT} and @code{UPDATE} statements that take a
long time to complete.  @code{DELAYED} was introduced in MySQL
3.22.15.

There are some constraints on the use of @code{DELAYED}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{INSERT DELAYED} works only with @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM}
tables.
For @code{MyISAM} tables, if there is are no free blocks in the middle of the
data file, concurrent @code{SELECT} and @code{INSERT} statements are supported.
Under these circumstances, you very seldom need to use @code{INSERT
DELAYED} with @code{MyISAM}. @xref{MyISAM}.

@item
@code{INSERT DELAYED} should be used only for @code{INSERT} statements that
specify value lists. This is enforced as of MySQL 4.0.18.  The server ignores
@code{DELAYED} for @code{INSERT DELAYED ... SELECT} statements.

@item
The server ignores
@code{DELAYED} for @code{INSERT DELAYED ... ON DUPLICATE UPDATE} statements.

@item
Because the statement returns immediately before the rows are inserted,
you cannot use @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} to get the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
value the statement might generate.

@end itemize
@c end_description_for_help_topic

When a client uses @code{INSERT DELAYED}, it gets an okay from the server at
once, and the row is queued to be inserted when the table is not in use by
any other thread.

Another major benefit of using @code{INSERT DELAYED} is that inserts
from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much
faster than doing many separate inserts.

Note that currently the queued rows are held in memory only until they are
inserted into the table.  This means that if you terminate @code{mysqld}
forcefully (for example, with @code{kill -9}) or if @code{mysqld} dies
unexpectedly, any queued rows that have not been written to disk are lost!

The following describes in detail what happens when you use the
@code{DELAYED} option to @code{INSERT} or @code{REPLACE}.  In this
description, the ``thread'' is the thread that received an @code{INSERT
DELAYED} statement and ``handler'' is the thread that handles all
@code{INSERT DELAYED} statements for a particular table.

@itemize @bullet
@item
When a thread executes a @code{DELAYED} statement for a table, a handler
thread is created to process all @code{DELAYED} statements for the table, if
no such handler already exists.

@item
The thread checks whether the handler has acquired a @code{DELAYED}
lock already; if not, it tells the handler thread to do so.  The
@code{DELAYED} lock can be obtained even if other threads have a @code{READ}
or @code{WRITE} lock on the table.  However, the handler will wait for all
@code{ALTER TABLE} locks or @code{FLUSH TABLES} to ensure that the table
structure is up to date.

@item
The thread executes the @code{INSERT} statement, but instead of writing
the row to the table, it puts a copy of the final row into a queue that
is managed by the handler thread. Any syntax errors are noticed by the
thread and reported to the client program.

@item
The client can't obtain from the server  the number of duplicate records or
the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value for the resulting row, because the
@code{INSERT} returns before the insert operation has been completed.  (If
you use the C API, the @code{mysql_info()} function doesn't return anything
meaningful, for the same reason.)

@item
The binary log is updated by the handler thread when the row is inserted into
the table.  In case of multiple-row inserts, the binary log is updated when
the first row is inserted.

@item
After every @code{delayed_insert_limit} rows are written, the handler checks
whether any @code{SELECT} statements are still pending.  If so, it
allows these to execute before continuing.

@cindex delayed_insert_limit
@cindex timeout
@item
When the handler has no more rows in its queue, the table is unlocked.  If no
new @code{INSERT DELAYED} statements are received within
@code{delayed_insert_timeout} seconds, the handler terminates.

@item
If more than @code{delayed_queue_size} rows are pending already in a
specific handler queue, the thread requesting @code{INSERT DELAYED}
waits until there is room in the queue.  This is done to ensure that
the @code{mysqld} server doesn't use all memory for the delayed memory
queue.

@item
The handler thread shows up in the MySQL process list with
@code{delayed_insert} in the @code{Command} column.  It will be killed if
you execute a @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement or kill it with @code{KILL
thread_id}. However, before exiting, it will first store all queued rows into
the table. During this time it will not accept any new @code{INSERT}
statements from another thread. If you execute an @code{INSERT DELAYED}
statement after this, a new handler thread will be created.

Note that this means that @code{INSERT DELAYED} statements have higher
priority than normal @code{INSERT} statements if there is an @code{INSERT
DELAYED} handler already running!  Other update statements will have to wait
until the @code{INSERT DELAYED} queue is empty, someone terminates the handler
thread (with @code{KILL thread_id}), or someone executes @code{FLUSH TABLES}.

@item
The following status variables provide information about @code{INSERT
DELAYED} statements:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .55
@item @strong{Variable} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{Delayed_insert_threads} @tab Number of handler threads
@item @code{Delayed_writes} @tab Number of rows written with @code{INSERT DELAYED}
@item @code{Not_flushed_delayed_rows} @tab Number of rows waiting to be written
@end multitable

You can view these variables by issuing a @code{SHOW STATUS} statement or
by executing a @code{mysqladmin extended-status} command.
@end itemize

Note that @code{INSERT DELAYED} is slower than a normal @code{INSERT} if the
table is not in use.  There is also the additional overhead for the server
to handle a separate thread for each table for which there are delayed rows.
This means that you should use @code{INSERT DELAYED} only when you are
really sure you need it!

The @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement reads rows from a text file into a
table at a very high speed.
For more information about the efficiency of @code{INSERT} versus
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} and speeding up @code{LOAD DATA INFILE},
@ref{Insert speed}.

@cindex @code{mysqlimport}
You can also load data files by using the @code{mysqlimport} utility; it
operates by sending a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement to the server.  The
@code{--local} option causes @code{mysqlimport} to read data files from the
client host.  You can specify the @code{--compress} option to get better
performance over slow networks if the client and server support the
compressed protocol.
@xref{mysqlimport,  , @code{mysqlimport}}.

If you specify the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} keyword, execution of the
@code{LOAD DATA} statement is delayed until no other clients are reading
from the table.

If you specify the @code{CONCURRENT} keyword with a @code{MyISAM} table that
satisfies the condition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free
blocks in the middle),
then other threads can retrieve data from the table while @code{LOAD DATA}
is executing. Using this option affects the performance of @code{LOAD DATA}
a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same time.

If the @code{LOCAL} keyword is specified, it is
interpreted with respect to the client end of the connection:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If @code{LOCAL} is specified, the file is read by the client program on the
client host and sent to the server.

@item
If @code{LOCAL} is not specified, the
file must be located on the server host and is read directly by the server.

@end itemize

@code{LOCAL} is available in MySQL 3.22.6 or later.

For security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the
files must either reside in the database directory or be readable by all.
Also, to use @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} on server files, you must have the
@code{FILE} privilege.
@c end_description_for_help_topic
@xref{Privileges provided}.

Using @code{LOCAL} is a bit slower than letting the server access the files
directly, because the contents of the file must be sent over the connection
by the client to the server.  On the other hand, you do not need the
@code{FILE} privilege to load local files.

As of MySQL 3.23.49 and MySQL 4.0.2 (4.0.13 on Windows), 
@code{LOCAL} works only if your server
and your client both have been enabled to allow it.  For example, if
@code{mysqld} was started with @code{--local-infile=0}, @code{LOCAL} will
not work.
@xref{LOAD DATA LOCAL,  , @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL}}.

If you need @code{LOAD DATA} to read from a pipe, you can use the
following technique:

@example
mkfifo /mysql/db/x/x
chmod 666 /mysql/db/x/x
cat < /dev/tcp/10.1.1.12/4711 > /mysql/db/x/x
mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'x' INTO TABLE x" x
@end example

If you are using a version of MySQL older than 3.23.25,
you can use this technique only with @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE}.

@c old version
If you are using MySQL before Version 3.23.24, you can't read from a
FIFO with @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.  If you need to read from a FIFO (for
example, the output from @code{gunzip}), use @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE}
instead.

When locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.

@item
If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,
the server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.

@item
If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for
the file in the database directory of the default database.
@end itemize

Note that these rules mean that a file named as @file{./myfile.txt} is read from
the server's data directory, whereas the same file named as @file{myfile.txt} is
read from the database directory of the default database.  For example,
the following @code{LOAD DATA} statement reads the file @file{data.txt}
from the database directory for @code{db1} because @code{db1} is the current
database, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a
table in the @code{db2} database:

@example
mysql> USE db1;
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
@end example

The @code{REPLACE} and @code{IGNORE} keywords control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.

If you specify @code{REPLACE}, input rows replace existing rows (in other
words, rows that have the same value for a primary or unique index as an
existing row). @xref{REPLACE,  , @code{REPLACE}}.

If you specify @code{IGNORE}, input rows that duplicate an existing row
on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option,
the behavior depends on whether or not the @code{LOCAL} keyword is specified.
Without @code{LOCAL}, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is
found, and the rest of the text file is ignored.  With @code{LOCAL},
the default behavior is the same as if @code{IGNORE} is specified;
this is because the server has no way to stop transmission of the file
in the middle of the operation.

If you want to ignore foreign key constraints during the load operation, you
can issue a @code{SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0} statement before executing
@code{LOAD DATA}.

If you use @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} on an empty @code{MyISAM} table, all
non-unique indexes are created in a separate batch (like in
@code{REPAIR}).  This normally makes @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} much faster
when you have many indexes.  Normally this is very fast, but in some
extreme cases, you can create the indexes even faster by turning them off
with @code{ALTER TABLE .. DISABLE KEYS} before loading the file into the
table and using @code{ALTER TABLE .. ENABLE KEYS} to re-create the indexes
after loading the file.
@xref{Insert speed}.

@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} is the complement of @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}.
@xref{SELECT, , @code{SELECT}}.
To write data from a table to a file, use @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}.
To read the file back into a table, use @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
The syntax of the @code{FIELDS} and @code{LINES} clauses is the same for
both statements.  Both clauses are optional, but @code{FIELDS}
must precede @code{LINES} if both are specified.

If you specify a @code{FIELDS} clause,
each of its subclauses (@code{TERMINATED BY}, @code{[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED
BY}, and @code{ESCAPED BY}) is also optional, except that you must
specify at least one of them.

If you don't specify a @code{FIELDS} clause, the defaults are the
same as if you had written this:

@example
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
@end example

If you don't specify a @code{LINES} clause, the default
is the same as if you had written this:

@example
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STARTING BY ''
@end example

In other words, the defaults cause @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to act as follows
when reading input:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Look for line boundaries at newlines.

@item
Do not skip over any line prefix.

@item
Break lines into fields at tabs.

@item
Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

@item
Interpret occurrences of tab, newline, or @samp{\} preceded by
@samp{\} as literal characters that are part of field values.
@end itemize

Conversely, the defaults cause @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE} to act as
follows when writing output:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Write tabs between fields.

@item
Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.

@item
Use @samp{\} to escape instances of tab, newline, or @samp{\} that occur
within field values.

@item
Write newlines at the ends of lines.
@end itemize

Note that to write @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\\'}, you must specify two
backslashes for the value to be read as a single backslash.

@strong{Note:} If you have generated the text file on a Windows system, you
might have to use @code{LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'} to read the file
properly, because Windows programs typically use two characters as a line
terminator. Some programs, such as WordPad, might use @code{\r} as a line
terminator when writing files.  To read such files, use @code{LINES
TERMINATED BY '\r}.

If all the lines you want to read in have a common prefix that you want to
ignore, you can use @code{LINES STARTING BY 'prefix_string'} to skip over
the prefix.  If a line doesn't include the prefix, the entire line is
skipped.

The @code{IGNORE number LINES} option can be used to ignore lines at
the start of the file.  For example, you can use @code{IGNORE 1 LINES}
to skip over an initial header line containing column names:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt'
    -> INTO TABLE test IGNORE 1 LINES;
@end example

When you use @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE} in tandem with @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} to write data from a database into a file and then read
the file back into the database later, the field- and line-handling
options for both statements must match.  Otherwise, @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} will not interpret the contents of the file properly.  Suppose
that you use @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE} to write a file with
fields delimited by commas:

@example
mysql> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
    ->          FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    ->          FROM table2;
@end example

To read the comma-delimited file back in, the correct statement would be:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    ->           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
@end example

If instead you tried to read in the file with the statement shown here, it
wouldn't work because it instructs @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to look for
tabs between fields:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    ->           FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
@end example

The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as
a single field.

@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} can be used to read files obtained from
external sources, too. For example, a file in dBASE format will have
fields separated by commas and enclosed within double quotes.  If lines in
the file are terminated by newlines, the statement shown here
illustrates the field- and line-handling options you would use to load
the file:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
    ->           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
    ->           LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
@end example

Any of the field- or line-handling options can specify an empty string
(@code{''}).  If not empty, the @code{FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY}
and @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} values must be a single character.  The
@code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY}, @code{LINES STARTING BY}, and @code{LINES
TERMINATED BY} values can be more than one character.  For example, to write
lines that are terminated by carriage return/linefeed pairs, or to read a
file containing such lines, specify a @code{LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'}
clause.

To read a file containing jokes that are separated by lines consisting of
of @code{%%}, you can do this

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE jokes
    ->     (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     joke TEXT NOT NULL);
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/jokes.txt' INTO TABLE jokes
    ->     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ''
    ->     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n%%\n' (joke);
@end example

@code{FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY} controls quoting of fields.  For
output (@code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}), if you omit the word
@code{OPTIONALLY}, all fields are enclosed by the @code{ENCLOSED BY}
character.  An example of such output (using a comma as the field
delimiter) is shown here:

@example
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
@end example

If you specify @code{OPTIONALLY}, the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character is
used only to enclose @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} fields:

@example
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
@end example

Note that occurrences of the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character within a
field value are escaped by prefixing them with the @code{ESCAPED BY}
character.  Also note that if you specify an empty @code{ESCAPED BY}
value, it is possible to generate output that cannot be read properly by
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE}. For example, the preceding output just shown would
appear as follows if the escape character is empty.  Observe that the
second field in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

@example
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
@end example

For input, the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character, if present, is stripped
from the ends of field values.  (This is true whether or not @code{OPTIONALLY}
is specified; @code{OPTIONALLY} has no effect on input interpretation.)
Occurrences of the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character preceded by the
@code{ESCAPED BY} character are interpreted as part of the current
field value.

If the field begins with the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character, instances
of that character are recognized as terminating a field value only
if followed by the field or line @code{TERMINATED BY} sequence.
To avoid ambiguity, occurrences of the @code{ENCLOSED BY} character
within a field value can be doubled and will be interpreted as a
single instance of the character.  For example, if @code{ENCLOSED
BY '"'} is specified, quotes are handled as shown here:

@example
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -> The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -> The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -> The ""BIG"" boss
@end example

@code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} controls how to write or read special characters.
If the @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} character is not empty, it is used to prefix
the following characters on output:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} character
@item
The @code{FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY} character
@item
The first character of the @code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY} and
@code{LINES TERMINATED BY} values
@item
ASCII @code{0} (what is actually written following the escape character is
ASCII @code{'0'}, not a zero-valued byte)
@end itemize

If the @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} character is empty, no characters are
escaped and @code{NULL} is output as @code{NULL}, not @code{\N}.  It is
probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character,
particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters
in the list just given.

For input, if the @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} character is not empty, occurrences
of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally
as part of a field value.  The exceptions are an escaped @samp{0} or
@samp{N} (for example, @code{\0} or @code{\N} if the escape character is
@samp{\}).  These sequences are interpreted as ASCII NUL (a zero-valued
byte) and @code{NULL}.  The rules on @code{NULL} handling are described later
in this section.

For more information about @samp{\}-escape syntax,
see @ref{Literals}.

In certain cases, field- and line-handling options interact:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @code{LINES TERMINATED BY} is an empty string and @code{FIELDS
TERMINATED BY} is non-empty, lines are also terminated with
@code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY}.
@item
If the @code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY} and @code{FIELDS ENCLOSED BY} values
are both empty (@code{''}), a fixed-row (non-delimited) format is used.
With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields (but you
can still have a line terminator). Instead, column values are written
and read using the ``display'' widths of the columns.  For example, if a
column is declared as @code{INT(7)}, values for the column are written
using seven-character fields.  On input, values for the column are obtained
by reading seven characters.

@code{LINES TERMINATED BY} is still used to separate lines.  If a line
doesn't contain all fields, the rest of the columns are set to their
default values. If you don't have a line terminator, you should set this
to @code{''}.  In this case, the text file must contain all fields for
each row.

Fixed-row format also affects handling of @code{NULL} values, as described
later.
Note that fixed-size format will not work if you are using a multi-byte
character set.
@end itemize

Handling of @code{NULL} values varies according to the @code{FIELDS} and
@code{LINES} options in use:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For the default @code{FIELDS} and @code{LINES} values, @code{NULL} is
written as a field value of @code{\N} for output, and a field value of
@code{\N} is read as @code{NULL} for input (assuming that the @code{ESCAPED BY}
character is @samp{\}).

@item
If @code{FIELDS ENCLOSED BY} is not empty, a field containing the literal
word @code{NULL} as its value is read as a @code{NULL} value. This differs
from the word @code{NULL} enclosed within @code{FIELDS ENCLOSED BY}
characters, which is read as the string @code{'NULL'}.

@item
If @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} is empty, @code{NULL} is written as the word
@code{NULL}.

@item
With fixed-row format (which happens when @code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY} and
@code{FIELDS ENCLOSED BY} are both empty), @code{NULL} is written as an empty
string.  Note that this causes both @code{NULL} values and empty strings in
the table to be indistinguishable when written to the file because they are
both written as empty strings.  If you need to be able to tell the two apart
when reading the file back in, you should not use fixed-row format.
@end itemize

Some cases are not supported by @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}:
@itemize @bullet

@item
Fixed-size rows (@code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY} and @code{FIELDS ENCLOSED
BY} both empty) and @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} columns.

@item
If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of another,
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} won't be able to interpret the input properly.
For example, the following @code{FIELDS} clause would cause problems:

@example
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
@end example

@item
If @code{FIELDS ESCAPED BY} is empty, a field value that contains an occurrence
of @code{FIELDS ENCLOSED BY} or @code{LINES TERMINATED BY}
followed by the @code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY} value will cause @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} to stop reading a field or line too early.
This happens because @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} cannot properly determine
where the field or line value ends.
@end itemize

The following example loads all columns of the @code{persondata} table:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
@end example

By default, when no column list is provided at the end of the @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} statement, input lines are expected to contain a field for each
table column.  If you want to load only some of a table's columns, specify a
column list:

@example
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt'
    ->           INTO TABLE persondata (col1,col2,...);
@end example

You must also specify a column list if the order of the fields in the input
file differs from the order of the columns in the table.  Otherwise,
MySQL cannot tell how to match up input fields with table columns.

If an input line has too few fields, the table columns for which no input
field is present are set to their default values.  Default value assignment
is described in @ref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

An empty field value is interpreted differently than if the field value
is missing:

@itemize @bullet
@item
For string types, the column is set to the empty string.

@item
For numeric types, the column is set to @code{0}.

@item
For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate ``zero''
value for the type.
@xref{Date and time types}.
@end itemize

These are the same values that result if you assign an empty
string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly
in an @code{INSERT} or @code{UPDATE} statement.

@code{TIMESTAMP} columns are set to the current date and time only if there
is a @code{NULL} value for the column (that is, @code{\N}), or (for the
first @code{TIMESTAMP} column only) if the @code{TIMESTAMP} column is
omitted from the field list when a field list is specified.

@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} regards all input as strings, so you can't use
numeric values for @code{ENUM} or @code{SET} columns the way you can with
@code{INSERT} statements.  All @code{ENUM} and @code{SET} values must be
specified as strings!

If an input row has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and
the number of warnings is incremented.

When the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}
statement finishes, it returns an information string in the following format:

@example
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
@end example

@findex mysql_info()
If you are using the C API, you can get information about the statement by
calling the  @code{mysql_info()} C API function.
@xref{mysql_info, , @code{mysql_info()}}.

Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted
via the @code{INSERT} statement (@pxref{INSERT, , @code{INSERT}}), except
that @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} also generates warnings when there are too few
or too many fields in the input row.  The warnings are not stored anywhere;
the number of warnings can be used only as an indication of whether everything went
well.

From MySQL 4.1.1 on, you can use @code{SHOW WARNINGS} to get a list of the
first @code{max_error_count} warnings as information about what went wrong.
@xref{SHOW WARNINGS,  , @code{SHOW WARNINGS}}.

Before MySQL 4.1.1, only a warning count is available to indicate that
something went wrong.  If you get warnings and want to know exactly why you
got them, one way to do this is to dump the table into another file using
@code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE} and compare the file to your original input
file.

REPLACE [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED]
    [INTO] tbl_name [(col_name,...)]
    SELECT ...
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic REPLACE INTO  DELAYED LOW_PRIORITY INTO VALUES SELECT SET
@code{REPLACE} works exactly like @code{INSERT}, except that if an old
record in the table has the same value as a new record for a @code{PRIMARY
KEY} or a @code{UNIQUE} index, the old record is deleted before the new
record is inserted.
@xref{INSERT, ,@code{INSERT}}.

Note that unless the table has a @code{PRIMARY KEY} or @code{UNIQUE} index,
using a @code{REPLACE} statement makes no sense. It becomes equivalent to
@code{INSERT}, because there is no index to be used to determine whether a new
row duplicates another.

Values for all columns are taken from the values specified in the
@code{REPLACE} statement.  Any missing columns are set to their default
values, just as happens for @code{INSERT}.  You can't refer to values from
the old row and use them in the new row.  It appeared that you could do this
in some old MySQL versions, but that was a bug that has been corrected.

To be able to use @code{REPLACE}, you must have @code{INSERT} and
@code{DELETE} privileges for the table.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The @code{REPLACE} statement returns a count to indicate the number of rows
affected. This is the sum of the rows deleted and inserted. If the count is 1
for a single-row @code{REPLACE}, a row was inserted and no rows were deleted.
If the count is greater than 1, one or more old rows were deleted before the
new row was inserted. It is possible for a single row to replace more than one
old row if the table contains multiple unique indexes and the new row
duplicates values for different old rows in different unique indexes.

The affected-rows count makes it easy to determine whether @code{REPLACE}
only added a row or whether it also replaced any rows: Check whether the
count is 1 (added) or greater (replaced).

If you are using the C API, the affected-rows count can be obtained using the
@code{mysql_affected_rows()} function.

Here follows the used algorithm in more detail:
(This is also used with @code{LOAD DATA ... REPLACE}.)

@enumerate
@item
Try to insert the new row into the table
@item
While the insertion fails because a duplicate-key error occurs for a
primary or unique key:
@enumerate
@item

@code{SELECT} is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each @code{select_expression} indicates a column you want to retrieve.

@item
@code{table_references} indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve rows.
Its syntax is described in @ref{JOIN,  , @code{JOIN}}.

@item
@code{where_definition} indicates any conditions that selected rows must
satisfy.

@end itemize

@code{SELECT} can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.  
@c end_description_for_help_topic
For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1 + 1;

@item
@cindex aliases, on expressions
@cindex expression aliases
A @code{select_expression} can be given an alias using @code{AS alias_name}.
The alias is used as the expression's column name and can be used in
@code{GROUP BY},
@code{ORDER BY}, or @code{HAVING} clauses.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
    -> FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
@end example

The @code{AS} keyword is optional when aliasing a @code{select_expression}.
The preceding example could have been written like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) full_name
    -> FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
@end example

Because the @code{AS} is optional, a subtle problem can occur
if you forget the comma between two @code{SELECT} expressions: MySQL
interprets the second as an alias name. For example, in the following
statement, @code{columnb} is treated as an alias name:

@example
mysql> SELECT columna columnb FROM mytable;
@end example

@item
It is not allowable to use a column alias in a @code{WHERE} clause,
because the column value might not yet be determined when the
@code{WHERE} clause is executed.

The @code{FROM table_references} clause indicates the tables from which to
retrieve rows. If you name more than one table, you are performing a
join.  For information on join syntax, see @ref{JOIN, , @code{JOIN}}.
For each table specified, you can optionally specify an alias.

@example
tbl_name [[AS] alias]
    [[USE INDEX (key_list)]
      | [IGNORE INDEX (key_list)]
      | [FORCE INDEX (key_list)]]
@end example

The use of
@code{USE INDEX},
@code{IGNORE INDEX},
@code{FORCE INDEX}
to give the optimizer hints about how to choose indexes is described in
@ref{JOIN, , @code{JOIN}}.

In MySQL 4.0.14, you can use @code{SET MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY=value} as an
alternative way to force MySQL to prefer key scans instead of table scans.

@item
You can refer to a table within the current database as @code{tbl_name}
(within the current database), or as @code{db_name.tbl_name} to explicitly
specify a database.  You can refer to a column as @code{col_name},
@code{tbl_name.col_name}, or @code{db_name.tbl_name.col_name}.  You need not
specify a @code{tbl_name} or @code{db_name.tbl_name} prefix for a column
reference unless the reference would be ambiguous.  See @ref{Legal names}
for examples of ambiguity that require the more explicit column reference
forms.

@item
From MySQL 4.1.0 on, you are allowed to specify @code{DUAL} as a dummy
table name in situations where no tables are referenced:

@example
mysql> SELECT 1 + 1 FROM DUAL;
        -> 2
@end example

@code{DUAL} is purely a compatibility feature. Some other servers require
this syntax.

@item
@cindex aliases, for tables
@cindex table aliases
A table reference can be aliased using @code{tbl_name [AS] alias_name}:

@example
mysql> SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    ->     WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
mysql> SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee t1, info t2
    ->     WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
@end example

@item
In the @code{WHERE} clause, you can use any of the functions that
MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary) functions.
@xref{Functions}.

@item
@findex ORDER BY
Columns selected for output can be referred to in @code{ORDER BY} and
@code{GROUP BY} clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
positions.  Column positions are integers and begin with 1:

@example
mysql> SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    ->     ORDER BY region, seed;
mysql> SELECT college, region AS r, seed AS s FROM tournament
    ->     ORDER BY r, s;
mysql> SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    ->     ORDER BY 2, 3;
@end example

To sort in reverse order, add the @code{DESC} (descending) keyword to the
name of the column in the @code{ORDER BY} clause that you are sorting by.
The default is ascending order; this can be specified explicitly using
the @code{ASC} keyword.

Use of column positions is deprecated because the syntax has been removed from
the SQL standard.

@item
@cindex @code{GROUP BY}, extensions to standard SQL
If you use @code{GROUP BY}, output rows are sorted according to the
@code{GROUP BY} columns as if you had an @code{ORDER BY} for the same columns.
MySQL has extended the @code{GROUP BY} clause as of version 3.23.34 so that
you can also specify @code{ASC} and @code{DESC} after columns named in the
clause:

@example
SELECT a,COUNT(b) FROM test_table GROUP BY a DESC
@end example

@item
MySQL extends the use of @code{GROUP BY} to allow you to
select fields that are not mentioned in the @code{GROUP BY} clause.
If you are not getting the results you expect from your query, please
read the @code{GROUP BY} description.
@xref{Group by functions and modifiers}.

@item
As of MySQL 4.1.1, @code{GROUP BY} allows a @code{WITH ROLLUP} modifier.
@xref{GROUP-BY-Modifiers, , @code{GROUP BY} Modifiers}.

@item
The @code{HAVING} clause can refer to any column or alias named in a
@code{select_expression}. It is applied nearly last, just before items are
sent to the client, with no optimization.
(@code{LIMIT} is applied after @code{HAVING}.)

@item
Don't use @code{HAVING} for items that
should be in the @code{WHERE} clause.  For example, do not write this:

@example
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name HAVING col_name > 0;
@end example

Write this instead:

@example
mysql> SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name WHERE col_name > 0;
@end example

@item
The @code{HAVING} clause can refer to aggregate functions:

@example
mysql> SELECT user, MAX(salary) FROM users
    ->     GROUP BY user HAVING MAX(salary)>10;
@end example

However, that does not work in older MySQL servers (before version 3.22.5).
Instead, you can use a column alias in the select list and refer to the
alias in the @code{HAVING} clause:

@example
mysql> SELECT user, MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM users
    ->     GROUP BY user HAVING max_salary>10;
@end example

@item
The @code{LIMIT} clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned
by the @code{SELECT} statement.  @code{LIMIT} takes one or two numeric
arguments, which must be integer constants.

With two arguments, the first argument specifies the offset of the first row to
return, and the second specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
The offset of the initial row is 0 (not 1):

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15
@end example

For
compatibility with PostgreSQL, MySQL also supports the
@code{LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset} syntax.

To retrieve all rows from a certain offset up to the end of the result set,
you can use some large number for the second parameter. This statement
retrieves all rows from the 96th row to the last:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 95,18446744073709551615;
@end example

With one argument, the value specifies the number of rows to return from the
beginning of the result set:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows
@end example

In other words, @code{LIMIT n} is equivalent to @code{LIMIT 0,n}.

@item
@tindex /etc/passwd
The @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'} form of @code{SELECT} writes
the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server host, so you
must have the @code{FILE} privilege to use this form of @code{SELECT}.  The
file cannot already exist, which among other things prevents database tables
and files such as @file{/etc/passwd} from being destroyed.

The @code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE} statement is intended primarily to let
you very quickly dump a table on the server machine. If you want to create
the resulting file on some host other than the server host, you can't use
@code{SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE}. In that case, you should instead use some
client program like @code{mysql -e "SELECT ..." > outfile} to generate the file.

@code{SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE} is the complement of @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE}; the syntax for the @code{export_options} part of the statement
consists of the same @code{FIELDS} and @code{LINES} clauses that are used
with the @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement.
@xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

In the resulting text file, only the following characters are escaped by
the @code{ESCAPED BY} character:

@itemize @bullet
@item The @code{ESCAPED BY} character
@item The first character in @code{FIELDS TERMINATED BY}
@item The first character in @code{LINES TERMINATED BY}
@end itemize

Additionally, ASCII NUL (a zero-valued byte) is converted to @code{ESCAPED BY}
followed by @code{'0'} (ASCII 48).

The reason for the above is that you @emph{must} escape any @code{FIELDS
TERMINATED BY}, @code{ESCAPED BY}, or @code{LINES TERMINATED BY}
characters to reliably be able to read the file back. ASCII NUL is
escaped to make it easier to view with some pagers.

The resulting file doesn't have to conform to the SQL syntax, so nothing
else need be escaped.

Here is an example that produces a file in the comma-separated values format
used by many programs:

@example
SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.text'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM test_table;
@end example

@item
@findex DUMPFILE
If you use @code{INTO DUMPFILE} instead of @code{INTO OUTFILE}, MySQL writes
only one row into the file, without any column or line termination and
without performing any escape processing.  This is useful if you want to
store a @code{BLOB} value in a file.

@item
@strong{Note:} Any file created by @code{INTO OUTFILE} or @code{INTO
DUMPFILE} is writable by all users on the server host.  The reason for
this is that the MySQL server can't create a file that is owned by anyone
other than the user it's running as (you should never run @code{mysqld} as
@code{root}).  The file thus must be world-writable so that you can
manipulate its contents.

@item
A @code{PROCEDURE} clause names a procedure that should process the data
in the result set.  For an example, see @ref{procedure analyse}.

@item
If you use @code{FOR UPDATE} on a storage engine with page or row locks,
the examined rows are write-locked until the end of the current
transaction.

@end itemize

Following the @code{SELECT} keyword, you can give a number of options
that affect the operation of the statement.

The @code{ALL}, @code{DISTINCT}, and @code{DISTINCTROW} options specify
whether duplicate rows should be returned. If none of these options are
given, the default is @code{ALL} (all matching rows are returned).
@code{DISTINCT} and @code{DISTINCTROW} are synonyms and specify that
duplicate rows in the result set should be removed.

@code{HIGH_PRIORITY}, @code{STRAIGHT_JOIN}, and options beginning with
@code{SQL_} are MySQL extensions to standard SQL.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{HIGH_PRIORITY} will give the @code{SELECT} higher priority than
a statement that updates a table.  You should use this only for queries
that are very fast and must be done at once.  A @code{SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY}
query that is issued while the table is locked for reading will run even if
there is already an update statement waiting for the table to be free.

@code{HIGH_PRIORITY} cannot be used with @code{SELECT} statements that
are part of a @code{UNION}.

@item
@cindex hints
@code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} forces the optimizer to join the tables in the order in
which they are listed in the @code{FROM} clause. You can use this to speed up
a query if the optimizer joins the tables in non-optimal order.
@xref{EXPLAIN, , @code{EXPLAIN}}.
@code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} also can be used in the @code{table_references} list.
@xref{JOIN, , @code{JOIN}}.

@item
@code{SQL_BIG_RESULT} can be used with @code{GROUP BY} or @code{DISTINCT}
to tell the optimizer that the result set will have many rows.  In this case,
MySQL will directly use disk-based temporary tables if needed.
MySQL will also, in this case, prefer sorting to using a
temporary table with a key on the @code{GROUP BY} elements.

@item
@code{SQL_BUFFER_RESULT} forces the result to be put into a temporary
table. This helps MySQL free the table locks early and helps
in cases where it takes a long time to send the result set to the client.

@item
@code{SQL_SMALL_RESULT} can be used
with @code{GROUP BY} or @code{DISTINCT} to tell the optimizer that the
result set will be small.  In this case, MySQL uses fast
temporary tables to store the resulting table instead of using sorting. In
MySQL 3.23 and up, this shouldn't normally be needed.

@item
@code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} (available in MySQL 4.0.0 and up) tells MySQL
to calculate how many rows there would be in the result set, disregarding
any @code{LIMIT} clause.  The number of rows can then be retrieved with
@code{SELECT FOUND_ROWS()}.
@xref{Information functions}.

Before MySQL 4.1.0, this option does not work with
@code{LIMIT 0}, which is optimized to return instantly (resulting in a
row count of 0).
@xref{LIMIT optimisation,  , @code{LIMIT} optimisation}.

@item
@code{SQL_CACHE} tells MySQL to store the query result in the query cache if
you are using a @code{query_cache_type} value of @code{2} or @code{DEMAND}.
For a query that uses @code{UNION} or subqueries, this option takes effect
to be used in any @code{SELECT} of the query.
@xref{Query Cache}.

@item
@code{SQL_NO_CACHE} tells MySQL not to store the query result
in the query cache. @xref{Query Cache}.
For a query that uses @code{UNION} or subqueries, this
option takes effect to be used in any @code{SELECT} of the query.

MySQL supports the following @code{JOIN} syntaxes for the
@code{table_references} part of @code{SELECT} statements and multiple-table
@code{DELETE} and @code{UPDATE} statements:

@example
table_reference, table_reference
table_reference [INNER | CROSS] JOIN table_reference [join_condition]

@end example

Where @code{table_reference} is defined as:
@findex AS
@example
tbl_name [[AS] alias]
    [[USE INDEX (key_list)]
      | [IGNORE INDEX (key_list)]
      | [FORCE INDEX (key_list)]]
@end example

and @code{join_condition} is defined as:

@example
ON conditional_expr | USING (column_list)
@end example
@c end_description_for_help_topic

You should generally not have any conditions in the @code{ON} part that are
used to restrict which rows you want in the result set, but rather specify
these conditions in the @code{WHERE} clause. There are exceptions to this rule.

Note that @code{INNER JOIN} syntax allows a @code{join_condition} only from
MySQL 3.23.17 on.  The same is true for @code{JOIN} and @code{CROSS JOIN} only
as of MySQL 4.0.11.

@cindex ODBC compatibility

The @code{@{OJ ... LEFT OUTER JOIN ...@}} syntax shown in the preceding list
exists only for compatibility with ODBC.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A table reference can be aliased using @code{tbl_name AS alias_name} or
@code{tbl_name alias_name}:

@example
mysql> SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    ->        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
@end example

@item
The @code{ON} conditional is any conditional of the form that can be used in
a @code{WHERE} clause.

@item
If there is no matching record for the right table in the @code{ON} or
@code{USING} part in a @code{LEFT JOIN}, a row with all columns set to
@code{NULL} is used for the right table.  You can use this fact to find
records in a table that have no counterpart in another table:

@c example_for_help_topic JOIN
@example
mysql> SELECT table1.* FROM table1
    ->        LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
    ->        WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
@end example

This example finds all rows in @code{table1} with an @code{id} value that is
not present in @code{table2} (that is, all rows in @code{table1} with no
corresponding row in @code{table2}).  This assumes that @code{table2.id} is
declared @code{NOT NULL}.
@xref{LEFT JOIN optimisation,  , @code{LEFT JOIN} optimisation}.

@item
The @code{USING} @code{(column_list)} clause names a list of columns that must
exist in both tables. The following two clauses are semantically identical:

@example
a LEFT JOIN b USING (c1,c2,c3)
a LEFT JOIN b ON a.c1=b.c1 AND a.c2=b.c2 AND a.c3=b.c3
@end example

@item
The @code{NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN} of two tables is defined to be
semantically equivalent to an @code{INNER JOIN} or a @code{LEFT JOIN}
with a @code{USING} clause that names all columns that exist in both
tables.

@item
@cindex hints
@code{INNER JOIN} and @code{,} (comma) are semantically equivalent in
the absence of a join condition: both will produce a Cartesian product
between the specified tables (that is, each and every row in the first table
will be joined onto all rows in the second table).

@item
@code{RIGHT JOIN} works analogously to @code{LEFT JOIN}.  To keep code
portable across databases, it's recommended to use @code{LEFT JOIN}
instead of @code{RIGHT JOIN}.

@item
@cindex hints
@code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} is identical to @code{JOIN}, except that the left table
is always read before the right table. This can be used for those (few)
cases in which the join optimizer puts the tables in the wrong order.

@end itemize

@cindex hints
@findex USE INDEX
@findex IGNORE INDEX
As of MySQL 3.23.12, you can give hints about which index MySQL
should use when retrieving information from a table.  By specifying
@code{USE INDEX (key_list)}, you can tell MySQL to use only one of the
possible indexes to find rows in the table.  The alternative syntax
@code{IGNORE INDEX (key_list)} can be used to tell MySQL to not use some
particular index.  These hints are useful if @code{EXPLAIN} shows that MySQL
is using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.

@findex FORCE INDEX
From MySQL 4.0.9 on, you can also use @code{FORCE INDEX}. This acts likes
@code{USE INDEX (key_list)} but with the addition that a table scan
is assumed to be @emph{very} expensive.  In other words, a table scan will
only be used if there is no way to use one of the given indexes to
find rows in the table.

@findex USE KEY
@findex IGNORE KEY
@findex FORCE KEY
@code{USE KEY}, @code{IGNORE KEY}, and @code{FORCE KEY} are synonyms for
@code{USE INDEX}, @code{IGNORE INDEX}, and @code{FORCE INDEX}.

@strong{Note:} @code{USE INDEX}, @code{IGNORE INDEX}, and @code{FORCE INDEX}
only affect which indexes are used when MySQL decides how to find rows in
the table and how to do the join. They do not affect whether an index will
be used when resolving an @code{ORDER BY} or @code{GROUP BY}.

Some examples:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;
mysql> SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id;
mysql> SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 USING (id);

@example
SELECT ...
UNION [ALL | DISTINCT]
SELECT ...
  [UNION [ALL | DISTINCT]
   SELECT ...]
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic UNION  ALL
@code{UNION} is used to combine the result from many @code{SELECT}
statements into one result set.  @code{UNION} is available from MySQL 4.0.0
on.

The columns listed in the @code{select_expression} portion of the @code{SELECT}
should have the same type. The column names used in the first
@code{SELECT} query will be used as the column names for the results
returned.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The @code{SELECT} statements are normal select statements, but with the following
restrictions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Only the last @code{SELECT} statement can have @code{INTO OUTFILE}.
@item
@code{HIGH_PRIORITY} cannot be used with @code{SELECT} statements that
are part of a @code{UNION}. If you specify it for the first @code{SELECT},
it has no effect. If you specify it for any subsequent @code{SELECT}
statements, a syntax error results.
@end itemize

If you don't use the keyword @code{ALL} for the @code{UNION}, all
returned rows will be unique, as if you had done a @code{DISTINCT} for
the total result set.  If you specify @code{ALL}, you will get all
matching rows from all the used @code{SELECT} statements.

The @code{DISTINCT} keyword is an optional word (introduced in MySQL 4.0.17).
It does nothing, but is required by the SQL standard.

If you want to use an @code{ORDER BY} to sort the entire @code{UNION} result,
you should use parentheses:

@example
(SELECT a FROM tbl_name WHERE a=10 AND B=1 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10)
UNION
(SELECT a FROM tbl_name WHERE a=11 AND B=2 ORDER BY a LIMIT 10)
ORDER BY a;
@end example

@strong{Note:} You cannot mix @code{UNION ALL} and @code{UNION
DISTINCT} in the same query yet.  If you use @code{ALL} for one
@code{UNION} then it is used for all of them.
@c this is also written in the "known bugs" section

The types and lengths of the columns in the result set of a @code{UNION}
take into account the values retrieved by all the @code{SELECT} statements.
Before MySQL 4.1.1, a limitation of @code{UNION} is that only the values from
the first @code{SELECT} are used to determine result column types and lengths.
This could result in value truncation if, for example, the first
@code{SELECT} retrieves shorter values than the second @code{SELECT}:

@example
mysql> SELECT REPEAT('a',1) UNION SELECT REPEAT('b',10);
+---------------+
| REPEAT('a',1) |
+---------------+
| a             |
| b             |
+---------------+
@end example

That limitation has been removed as of MySQL 4.1.1:

@example
mysql> SELECT REPEAT('a',1) UNION SELECT REPEAT('b',10);
+---------------+
| REPEAT('a',1) |
+---------------+
| a             |
| bbbbbbbbbb    |
+---------------+

@subsection Subquery Syntax

@cindex subselects
@cindex subqueries
@cindex subquery
@cindex nested queries
@cindex nested query
@cindex nesting queries

A subquery is a @code{SELECT} statement inside another statement.
For example:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
@end example

In this example, @code{SELECT * FROM t1 ...} is the @emph{outer query}
(or @emph{outer statement}), and @code{(SELECT column1 FROM t2)} is the
@emph{subquery}.
We say that the subquery is @emph{nested} in the outer query, and in fact
it's possible to nest subqueries within other subqueries, to a great depth.
A subquery must always appear within parentheses.

The main advantages of subqueries are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
They allow queries that are @emph{structured} so that it's possible to
isolate each part of a statement.
@item
They provide alternative ways to perform operations that would otherwise
require complex joins and unions.
@item
They are, in many people's opinion, readable.
Indeed, it was the innovation of subqueries that gave people the original
idea of calling the early @code{SQL} ``Structured Query Language.''
@end itemize

Starting with MySQL 4.1, all subquery forms and operations that the SQL
standard requires are supported, as well as a few features that are
MySQL-specific.

With earlier MySQL versions, it was necessary to work around or avoid the use
of
subqueries, but people starting to write code now will find that subqueries
are a very useful part of the MySQL toolkit.

Here is an example statement that shows the major points about subquery
syntax as specified by the SQL standard and supported in MySQL:

@example
DELETE FROM t1
WHERE s11 > ANY
 (SELECT COUNT(*) /* no hint */ FROM t2
 WHERE NOT EXISTS
  (SELECT * FROM t3
   WHERE ROW(5*t2.s1,77)=
    (SELECT 50,11*s1 FROM t4 UNION SELECT 50,77 FROM
     (SELECT * FROM t5) AS t5)));
@end example

For MySQL versions prior to 4.1, most subqueries can be successfully
rewritten using joins and other methods.

@node Scalar subqueries, Comparisons using subqueries, Subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection The Subquery as Scalar Operand

In its simplest form (the @emph{scalar} subquery as opposed to the
@emph{row} or @emph{table} subqueries that are discussed later),
a subquery is a simple operand. Thus, you can use it wherever a column value
or literal is legal, and you can expect it to have those characteristics
that all operands have: a data type, a length, an indication whether it can
be @code{NULL}, and so on.
For example:

@example
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT, s2 CHAR(5) NOT NULL);
SELECT (SELECT s2 FROM t1);
@end example

The subquery in this @code{SELECT} has a data type of @code{CHAR},
a length of 5, a character set and collation equal to the defaults in
effect at @code{CREATE TABLE} time, and an indication that the value in
the column can be @code{NULL}. In fact, almost all subqueries can be
@code{NULL}, because if the table is empty, as in the example,
the value of the subquery will be @code{NULL}.
There are few restrictions.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A subquery's outer statement can be any one of:
@code{SELECT}, @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE},
@code{SET}, or @code{DO}.
@item
A subquery can contain any of the keywords or clauses that an ordinary
@code{SELECT} can contain:
@code{DISTINCT}, @code{GROUP BY}, @code{ORDER BY}, @code{LIMIT},
joins, hints, @code{UNION} constructs, comments, functions, and so on.
@end itemize

So, when you see examples in the following sections that contain the rather
spartan construct @code{(SELECT column1 FROM t1)}, imagine that your own
code will contain much more diverse and complex constructions.

For example, suppose that we make two tables:

@example
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
CREATE TABLE t2 (s1 INT);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2);
@end example

Then perform a @code{SELECT}:

@example
SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1;
@end example

The result will be @code{2} because there is a row in @code{t2} containing a
column @code{s1} that has a value of @code{2}.

The subquery can be part of an expression. If it is an operand for a
function, don't forget the parentheses.
For example:

@example
SELECT UPPER((SELECT s1 FROM t1)) FROM t2;
@end example


@node Comparisons using subqueries, ANY IN SOME subqueries, Scalar subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Comparisons Using Subqueries

The most common use of a subquery is in the form:

@example
non_subquery_operand comparison_operator (subquery)
@end example

Where @code{comparison_operator} is one of:
@example
=  >  <  >=  <=  <>
@end example

For example:
@example
... 'a' = (SELECT column1 FROM t1)
@end example

At one time the only legal place for a subquery was on the right side of a
comparison, and you might still find some old DBMSs which insist on that.

Here is an example of a common-form subquery comparison that you can't do
with a join. It finds all the values in table @code{t1} that are equal to a
maximum value in table @code{t2}:

@example
SELECT column1 FROM t1
       WHERE column1 = (SELECT MAX(column2) FROM t2);
@end example

Here is another example, which again is impossible with a join because it
involves aggregating for one of the tables. It finds all rows in table
@code{t1} that contain a value which occurs twice:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1
       WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(column1) FROM t1);
@end example


@node ANY IN SOME subqueries, ALL subqueries, Comparisons using subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Subqueries with @code{ANY}, @code{IN}, and @code{SOME}

Syntax:
@example
operand comparison_operator ANY (subquery)
operand IN (subquery)
operand comparison_operator SOME (subquery)
@end example

The @code{ANY} keyword, which must follow a comparison operator, means
``return @code{TRUE} if the comparison is @code{TRUE} for @code{ANY} of the
rows that the subquery returns.''
For example,

@example
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 > ANY (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

Suppose that there is a row in table @code{t1} containing (10).
The expression is @code{TRUE} if table @code{t2} contains (21,14,7) because
there is a value @code{7} in @code{t2} that is less than 10.
The expression is @code{FALSE} if table @code{t2} contains (20,10),
or if table @code{t2} is empty.
The expression is @code{UNKNOWN} if table @code{t2} contains
(@code{NULL},@code{NULL},@code{NULL}).

The word @code{IN} is an alias for @code{= ANY}. Thus these two statements
are the same:

@example
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 = ANY (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 IN    (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

The word @code{SOME} is an alias for @code{ANY}. Thus these two statements
are the same:

@example
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> ANY  (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 <> SOME (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

Use of the word @code{SOME} is rare, but this example shows why it might be
useful. To most people's ears, the English phrase ``a is not equal to any
b'' means ``there is no b which is equal to a,'' but that isn't what is
meant by the SQL syntax. Using @code{<> SOME} instead helps ensure that
everyone understands the true meaning of the query.


@node ALL subqueries, Correlated subqueries, ANY IN SOME subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Subqueries with @code{ALL}

Syntax:
@example
operand comparison_operator ALL (subquery)
@end example

The word @code{ALL}, which must follow a comparison operator, means
``return @code{TRUE} if the comparison is @code{TRUE} for @code{ALL} of
the rows that the subquery returns.''
For example,

@example
SELECT s1 FROM t1 WHERE s1 > ALL (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

Suppose that there is a row in table @code{t1} containing (10).
The expression is @code{TRUE} if table @code{t2} contains (-5,0,+5)
because @code{10} is greater than all three values in @code{t2}.
The expression is @code{FALSE} if table @code{t2} contains
(12,6,NULL,-100) because there is a single value @code{12} in table @code{t2}
that is greater than @code{10}.
The expression is @code{UNKNOWN} if table @code{t2} contains (0,NULL,1).

Finally, if table @code{t2} is empty, the result is @code{TRUE}.
You might think the result should be @code{UNKNOWN}, but
sorry, it's @code{TRUE}. So, rather oddly,

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > ALL (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

is @code{TRUE} when table @code{t2} is empty, but

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

is @code{UNKNOWN} when table @code{t2} is empty. In addition,

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 1 > ALL (SELECT MAX(s1) FROM t2);
@end example

is @code{UNKNOWN} when table @code{t2} is empty.
In general, @emph{tables with @code{NULL} values} and @emph{empty tables} are
@emph{edge cases}. When writing subquery code, always consider whether
you have taken those two possibilities into account.


@node Correlated subqueries, EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries, ALL subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Correlated Subqueries

A @emph{correlated subquery} is a subquery that contains a reference to a
column that also appears in the outer query.
For example:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = ANY
       (SELECT column1 FROM t2 WHERE t2.column2 = t1.column2);
@end example

Notice that the subquery contains a reference to a column
of @code{t1}, even though the subquery's @code{FROM} clause doesn't mention
a table @code{t1}. So, MySQL looks outside the subquery, and finds @code{t1} in the
outer query.

Suppose that table @code{t1} contains a row where @code{column1 = 5} and
@code{column2 = 6}; meanwhile, table @code{t2} contains a row where
@code{column1 = 5} and @code{column2 = 7}. The simple expression
@code{... WHERE column1 = ANY (SELECT column1 FROM t2)} would be
@code{TRUE}, but in this example the @code{WHERE} clause within the
subquery is @code{FALSE} (because 7 <> 5), so the subquery as a whole is
@code{FALSE}.

@strong{Scoping rule:} MySQL evaluates from inside to outside.
For example:

@example
SELECT column1 FROM t1 AS x
  WHERE x.column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2 AS x
    WHERE x.column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t3
      WHERE x.column2 = t3.column1));
@end example

In this statement, @code{x.column2} must be a column in table @code{t2} because
@code{SELECT column1 FROM t2 AS x ...} renames @code{t2}. It is not a
column in table @code{t1} because @code{SELECT column1 FROM t1 ...} is an
outer query that is @emph{farther out}.

For subqueries in @code{HAVING} or @code{ORDER BY} clauses, MySQL also
looks for column names in the outer select list.

For certain cases, a correlated subquery is optimized. For example:

@example
val IN (SELECT key_val FROM tbl_name WHERE correlated_condition)
@end example

Otherwise, they are inefficient and likely to be slow. Rewriting the query
as a join might improve performance.


@node EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries, Row subqueries, Correlated subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection @code{EXISTS} and @code{NOT EXISTS}

If a subquery returns any values at all, then @code{EXISTS subquery} is
@code{TRUE}, and @code{NOT EXISTS subquery} is @code{FALSE}.
For example:

@example
SELECT column1 FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2);
@end example

Traditionally, an @code{EXISTS} subquery starts with @code{SELECT *}, but it
could begin with @code{SELECT 5} or @code{SELECT column1} or anything at
all. MySQL ignores the @code{SELECT} list in such a subquery, so it
doesn't matter.

For the preceding example, if @code{t2} contains any rows, even rows with
nothing but @code{NULL} values, then the @code{EXISTS} condition is
@code{TRUE}. This is actually an unlikely example, since almost always a
@code{[NOT] EXISTS} subquery will contain correlations.
Here are some more realistic examples:

@itemize @bullet
@item
What kind of store is present in one or more cities?
@example
SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM Stores
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Cities_Stores
                WHERE Cities_Stores.store_type = Stores.store_type);
@end example

@item
What kind of store is present in no cities?
@example
SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM Stores
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Cities_Stores
                    WHERE Cities_Stores.store_type = Stores.store_type);
@end example

@item
What kind of store is present in all cities?
@example
SELECT DISTINCT store_type FROM Stores S1
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM Cities WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT * FROM Cities_Stores
       WHERE Cities_Stores.city = Cities.city
       AND Cities_Stores.store_type = Stores.store_type));
@end example

@end itemize

The last example is a double-nested @code{NOT EXISTS} query. It has a
@code{NOT EXISTS} clause within a @code{NOT EXISTS} clause. Formally, it
answers the question ``does a city exist with a store which is not in
@code{Stores}?'' But it's easier to say that a nested @code{NOT EXISTS} answers
the question ``is x TRUE for all y?''


@node Row subqueries, Unnamed views, EXISTS and NOT EXISTS subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Row Subqueries

The discussion to this point has been of
@emph{column (or scalar) subqueries}: subqueries that return a single
column value. A @emph{row subquery} is a subquery variant that returns a
single row value -- and can thus return more than one column value.
Here are two examples:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (1,2) = (SELECT column1, column2 FROM t2);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE ROW(1,2) = (SELECT column1, column2 FROM t2);
@end example

The queries here are both @code{TRUE} if table @code{t2} has
a row where @code{column1 = 1} and @code{column2 = 2}.

The expressions @code{(1,2)} and @code{ROW(1,2)} are sometimes called
@emph{row constructors}. The two are equivalent.
They are legal in other contexts, too. For example, the following two
statements are semantically equivalent (although currently only the second one
can be optimized):

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (column1,column2) = (1,1);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = 1 AND column2 = 1;
@end example

The normal use of row constructors, though, is for comparisons with
subqueries that return two or more columns. For example, the following query answers
the request, ``find all rows in table t1 which are duplicated in table t2'':

@example
SELECT column1,column2,column3
       FROM t1
       WHERE (column1,column2,column3) IN
             (SELECT column1,column2,column3 FROM t2);
@end example


@node Unnamed views, Subquery errors, Row subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Subqueries in the @code{FROM} clause

@cindex derived tables
@cindex unnamed views

Subqueries are legal in a @code{SELECT} statement's @code{FROM} clause.
The syntax that you'll actually see is:

@example
SELECT ... FROM (subquery) AS name ...
@end example

The @code{AS name} clause is mandatory, because every table in a
@code{FROM} clause must have a name. Any columns in the @code{subquery}
select list must have unique names. You can find this syntax described
elsewhere in this manual, where the term used is ``derived tables.''

For illustration, assume that you have this table:
@example
CREATE TABLE t1 (s1 INT, s2 CHAR(5), s3 FLOAT);
@end example

Here's how to use a subquery in the @code{FROM} clause, using
the example table:

@example
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1,'1',1.0);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2,'2',2.0);
SELECT sb1,sb2,sb3
       FROM (SELECT s1 AS sb1, s2 AS sb2, s3*2 AS sb3 FROM t1) AS sb
       WHERE sb1 > 1;
@end example

Result: @code{2, '2', 4.0}.

Here's another example: Suppose that you want to know the average of the sum for
a grouped table. This won't work:
@example
SELECT AVG(SUM(column1)) FROM t1 GROUP BY column1;
@end example

But this query will provide the desired information:

@example
SELECT AVG(sum_column1)
       FROM (SELECT SUM(column1) AS sum_column1
             FROM t1 GROUP BY column1) AS t1;
@end example

Notice that the column name used within the subquery
@code{(sum_column1)} is recognized in the outer query.

At the moment, subqueries in the @code{FROM} clause cannot be correlated
subqueries.

Subquery in the @code{FROM} clause will be executed (that is, derived temporary
tables will be built) even for the @code{EXPLAIN} statement, because upper
level queries need information about all tables during optimization phase.

@node Subquery errors, Optimising subqueries, Unnamed views, Subqueries
@subsubsection Subquery Errors

There are some new error returns that apply only to subqueries.
This section groups them together because reviewing them will help
remind you of some points.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@example
ERROR 1235 (ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET)
SQLSTATE = 42000
Message = "This version of MySQL doesn't yet support
'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'"
@end example

This means that

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE s1 IN (SELECT s2 FROM t2 ORDER BY s1 LIMIT 1)
@end example

will not work, but only in some early versions, such as MySQL 4.1.1.

@item
@example
ERROR 1240 (ER_CARDINALITY_COL)
SQLSTATE = 21000
Message = "Operand should contain 1 column(s)"
@end example

This error will occur in cases like this:

@example
SELECT (SELECT column1, column2 FROM t2) FROM t1;
@end example

It's okay to use a subquery that returns multiple columns, if the purpose
is comparison. @xref{Row subqueries}.
But in other contexts, the subquery must be a scalar operand.

@item
@example
ERROR 1241 (ER_SUBSELECT_NO_1_ROW)
SQLSTATE = 21000
Message = "Subquery returns more than 1 row"
@end example

This error will occur in cases like this:
@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
@end example

but only when there is more than one row in @code{t2}. That means this
error might occur in code that has been working for years, because somebody
happened to make a change that affected the number of rows that the
subquery can return. Remember that if the object is to find any number of
rows, not just one, then the correct statement would look like this:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = ANY (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
@end example

@item
@example
Error 1093 (ER_UPDATE_TABLE_USED)
SQLSTATE = HY000
Message = "You can't specify target table 'x'
for update in FROM clause"
@end example

This error will occur in cases like this:

@example
UPDATE t1 SET column2 = (SELECT MAX(column1) FROM t1);
@end example
@end itemize

It's okay to use a subquery for assignment within an
@code{UPDATE} statement, since subqueries are legal in @code{UPDATE}
and @code{DELETE} statements as well as in @code{SELECT} statements.
However, you cannot use the same table, in this case table @code{t1}, for
both the subquery's @code{FROM} clause and the update target.

Usually, failure of the subquery causes the entire statement to fail.


@node Optimising subqueries, Rewriting subqueries, Subquery errors, Subqueries
@subsubsection Optimizing Subqueries

Development is ongoing, so no optimization tip is reliable for the long
term. Some interesting tricks that you might want to play with are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use subquery clauses that affect the number or order of the rows in the
subquery. For example:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.column1 IN
  (SELECT column1 FROM t2 ORDER BY column1);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.column1 IN
  (SELECT DISTINCT column1 FROM t2);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS
  (SELECT * FROM t2 LIMIT 1);
@end example

@item
Replace a join with a subquery. For example, use this query:

@example
SELECT DISTINCT column1 FROM t1 WHERE t1.column1 IN (
  SELECT column1 FROM t2);
@end example

Instead of this query:

@example
SELECT DISTINCT t1.column1 FROM t1, t2
  WHERE t1.column1 = t2.column1;
@end example

@item
Move clauses from outside to inside the subquery. For example, use this
query:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE s1 IN (SELECT s1 FROM t1 UNION ALL SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

Instead of this query:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE s1 IN (SELECT s1 FROM t1) OR s1 IN (SELECT s1 FROM t2);
@end example

For another example, use this query:

@example
SELECT (SELECT column1 + 5 FROM t1) FROM t2;
@end example

Instead of this query:

@example
SELECT (SELECT column1 FROM t1) + 5 FROM t2;
@end example

@item
Use a row subquery instead of a correlated subquery. For example, use this
query:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE (column1,column2) IN (SELECT column1,column2 FROM t2);
@end example

Instead of this query:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t2.column1=t1.column1
  AND t2.column2=t1.column2);
@end example

@item
Use @code{NOT (a = ANY (...))} rather than @code{a <> ALL (...)}.

@item
Use @code{x = ANY (table containing (1,2))} rather than
@code{x=1 OR x=2}.

@item
Use @code{= ANY} rather than @code{EXISTS}
@end itemize

These tricks might cause programs to go faster or slower. Using MySQL
facilities like the @code{BENCHMARK()} function, you can get an idea about
what helps in your own situation. Don't worry too much about transforming
to joins except for compatibility with older versions of MySQL (before 4.1)
that do not support subqueries.

Some optimizations that MySQL itself will make are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
MySQL will execute non-correlated subqueries only once. Use @code{EXPLAIN}
to make sure that a given subquery really is non-correlated.

@item
MySQL will rewrite @code{IN}/@code{ALL}/@code{ANY}/@code{SOME} subqueries
in an attempt to take advantage of the possibility that the select-list
columns in the subquery are indexed.

@item
MySQL will replace subqueries of the form:

@example
... IN (SELECT indexed_column FROM single_table ...)
@end example

@c TODO: what join type is this?

with an index-lookup function, which @code{EXPLAIN} will describe as a
special join type.

@item
MySQL will enhance expressions of the form

@example
value @{ALL|ANY|SOME@} @{> | < | >= | <=@} (non-correlated subquery)
@end example

with an expression involving @code{MIN()} or @code{MAX()} (unless @code{NULL}
values or empty sets are involved). For example, this @code{WHERE} clause:

@example
WHERE 5 > ALL (SELECT x FROM t)
@end example

might be treated by the optimizer like this:

@example
WHERE 5 > (SELECT MAX(x) FROM t)
@end example

@end itemize

There is a chapter titled ``How MySQL Transforms Subqueries''
in the MySQL Internals Manual. You can obtain this document by downloading the
MySQL source package and looking for a file named @file{internals.texi} in the
@file{Docs} directory.


@node Rewriting subqueries,  , Optimising subqueries, Subqueries
@subsubsection Rewriting Subqueries as Joins for Earlier MySQL Versions

Before MySQL 4.1, only nested queries of the form
@code{INSERT ... SELECT ...} and @code{REPLACE ... SELECT ...}
are supported.
The @code{IN()} construct can be used in other contexts to test membership in
a set of values.

It is often possible to rewrite a query without a subquery:

@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM t2);
@end example

This can be rewritten as:

@example
SELECT t1.* FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.id=t2.id;
@end example

The queries:
@example
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM t2);
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM t2 WHERE t1.id=t2.id);
@end example

Can be rewritten as:

@example
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
                                       WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
@end example

A @code{LEFT [OUTER] JOIN} can be faster than an equivalent subquery
because the server might be able to optimize it better---a fact that is
not specific to MySQL Server alone.
Prior to SQL-92, outer joins did not exist, so subqueries were the only way
to do certain things in those bygone days. Today, MySQL Server and many
other modern database systems offer a whole range of outer join types.

For more complicated subqueries, you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however, this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
@code{DELETE} statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in subqueries).  For this situation, there are three options
available:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first option is to upgrade to MySQL 4.1, which does support
subqueries in @code{DELETE} statements.

@item
The second option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a @code{SELECT} query to obtain the primary keys
for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct
the @code{DELETE} statement (@code{DELETE FROM ... WHERE key_col IN (key1,
key2, ...)}).

@item
The third option is to use interactive SQL to construct a set of
@code{DELETE} statements automatically, using the MySQL
extension @code{CONCAT()} (in lieu of the standard @code{||} operator).
For example:

@example
SELECT
  CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', "'", tab1.pkid, "'", ';')
  FROM tab1, tab2
 WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;
@end example

You can place this query in a script file, use the file as input to one
instance of the @code{mysql} program, and use the program output
as input to a second instance of @code{mysql}:

@example
shell> mysql --skip-column-names mydb < myscript.sql | mysql mydb
@end example
@end itemize

MySQL Server 4.0 supports multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements that can be used to
efficiently delete rows based on information from one table or even
from many tables at the same time.
Multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statements are also supported as of MySQL 4.0.

@c description_for_help_topic TRUNCATE TABLE
In MySQL 3.23, @code{TRUNCATE TABLE} is mapped to
@code{COMMIT; DELETE FROM tbl_name}. @xref{DELETE,  , @code{DELETE}}.

@code{TRUNCATE TABLE} differs from @code{DELETE FROM ...}
in the following ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much faster
than deleting rows one by one.
@item
Truncate operations are not transaction-safe; you will get an error if
you have an active transaction or an active table lock.
@item
The number of deleted rows is not returned.
@item
As long as the table definition file @file{tbl_name.frm} is
valid, the table can be re-created this way, even if the data or index
files have become corrupted.
@item
The table handler might not remember the last used @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
value, but may start counting from the beginning.  This is true for
@code{MyISAM}, @code{ISAM}, and @code{BDB} tables.
@end itemize


@code{TRUNCATE TABLE} is an Oracle SQL extension.
This statement was added in MySQL 3.23.28, although from 3.23.28
to 3.23.32, the keyword @code{TABLE} must be omitted.
@c end_description_for_help_topic


@node UPDATE,  , TRUNCATE, Data Manipulation
@subsection @code{UPDATE} Syntax

@findex UPDATE

@c example_for_help_topic UPDATE
Single-table syntax:
@example
UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] tbl_name
    SET col_name1=expr1 [, col_name2=expr2 ...]
    [WHERE where_definition]
    [ORDER BY ...]
    [LIMIT row_count]
@end example

Multiple-table syntax:

@example
UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] tbl_name [, tbl_name ...]
    SET col_name1=expr1 [, col_name2=expr2 ...]
    [WHERE where_definition]
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic UPDATE  BY LOW_PRIORITY IGNORE SET ORDER LIMIT WHERE
The @code{UPDATE} statement updates columns in existing table rows with new values.
The @code{SET} clause indicates which columns to modify and the values
they should be given.  The @code{WHERE} clause, if given, specifies
which rows should be updated.  Otherwise, all rows are updated. If the
@code{ORDER BY} clause is specified, the rows will be updated in the
order that is specified. The @code{LIMIT} clause places a limit on the number
of rows that can be updated.

The @code{UPDATE} statement supports the following modifiers:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you specify the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} keyword, execution of the
@code{UPDATE} is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

@item
If you specify the @code{IGNORE} keyword, the update statement will not
abort even if duplicate-key errors occur during the update.  Rows for which
conflicts occur are not updated.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@end itemize

If you access a column from @code{tbl_name} in an expression,
@code{UPDATE} uses the current value of the column.  For example, the
following statement sets the @code{age} column to one more than its
current value:

@example
mysql> UPDATE persondata SET age=age+1;
@end example

@code{UPDATE} assignments are evaluated from left to right.  For example, the
following statement doubles the @code{age} column, then increments it:

@example
mysql> UPDATE persondata SET age=age*2, age=age+1;
@end example

If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices
this and doesn't update it.

If you update a column that has been declared @code{NOT NULL} by
setting to @code{NULL}, the column is set to the default value appropriate
for the column type and the warning count is incremented.  The default
value is is @code{0} for numeric types, the empty string (@code{''})
for string types, and the ``zero'' value for date and time types.

@findex mysql_info()
@code{UPDATE} returns the number of rows that were actually changed.
In MySQL 3.22 or later, the C API function @code{mysql_info()}
returns the number of rows that were matched and updated and the number of
warnings that occurred during the @code{UPDATE}.

Starting from MySQL 3.23, you can use @code{LIMIT row_count} to
restrict the scope of the @code{UPDATE}. A @code{LIMIT} clause works as
follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Before MySQL 4.0.13, @code{LIMIT} is a rows-affected restriction.
The statement stops as soon as it has changed @code{row_count} rows that
satisfy the @code{WHERE} clause.

@item
From 4.0.13 on, @code{LIMIT} is a rows-matched restriction.  The statement
stops as soon as it has found @code{row_count} rows that satisfy the
@code{WHERE} clause, whether or not they actually were changed.

@end itemize

If an @code{UPDATE} statement includes an @code{ORDER BY} clause, the rows
are updated in the order specified by the clause.
@code{ORDER BY} can be used from MySQL 4.0.0.

Starting with MySQL 4.0.4, you can also perform @code{UPDATE}
operations that cover multiple tables:

@example
UPDATE items,month SET items.price=month.price
WHERE items.id=month.id;
@end example

The example shows an inner join using the comma operator, but
multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statements can use any type of
join allowed in @code{SELECT} statements, such as @code{LEFT JOIN}.

Note: You cannot use @code{ORDER BY} or @code{LIMIT} with multiple-table
@code{UPDATE}.

Before MySQL 4.0.18, you needed the @code{UPDATE} privilege for all
tables used in a multiple-table @code{UPDATE}, even if they were not
updated.  As of MySQL 4.0.18, you need only the @code{SELECT} privilege for
any columns that are read but not modified.

If you use a multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statement involving
@code{InnoDB} tables for which there are foreign key constraints,
the MySQL optimizer might process tables in an order that differs from
that of their parent/child relationship. In this case, the statement will
fail and roll back. Instead, update a single table and rely on the
@code{ON UPDATE} capabilities that @code{InnoDB} provides to cause the
other tables to be modified accordingly.

@code{ALTER DATABASE} allows you to change the overall characteristics of a

The @code{CHARACTER SET} clause changes the default database character set.
The @code{COLLATE} clause changes the default database collation.
Character set and collation names are discussed in
@ref{Charset}.


To use @code{ALTER DATABASE}, you need the @code{ALTER} privilege on the
database.

@code{ALTER TABLE} allows you to change the structure of an existing table.
For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change
the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself.  You can
also change the comment for the table and type of the table.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The syntax for many of the allowable alterations is similar to clauses of the
@code{CREATE TABLE} statement.
@xref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} to change a column specification but
@code{DESCRIBE tbl_name} indicates that your column was not changed, it is
possible that MySQL ignored your modification for one of the reasons
described in @ref{Silent column changes}.  For example, if you try to change
a @code{VARCHAR} column to @code{CHAR}, MySQL will still use
@code{VARCHAR} if the table contains other variable-length columns.

@code{ALTER TABLE} works by making a temporary copy of the original table.
The alteration is performed on the copy, then the original table is
deleted and the new one is renamed. This is done in such a way that
all updates are automatically redirected to the new table without
any failed updates. While @code{ALTER TABLE} is executing, the original
table is readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table
are stalled until the new table is ready.

Note that if you use any other option to @code{ALTER TABLE} than
@code{RENAME}, MySQL always creates a temporary table, even if the data
wouldn't strictly need to be copied (such as when you change the name of a
column). We plan to fix this in the future, but because @code{ALTER TABLE}
is not a statement that is normally used frequently, this isn't high on our
TODO list.  For @code{MyISAM} tables, you can speed up the index re-creation
operation (which is the slowest part of the alteration process) by setting
the @code{myisam_sort_buffer_size} system variable to a high value.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To use @code{ALTER TABLE}, you need @code{ALTER}, @code{INSERT},
and @code{CREATE} privileges for the table.

@item
@code{IGNORE} is a MySQL extension to standard SQL.
It controls how @code{ALTER TABLE} works if there are duplicates on
unique keys in the new table.
If @code{IGNORE} isn't specified, the copy is aborted and rolled back if
duplicate-key errors occur.
If @code{IGNORE} is specified, then for rows with duplicates on a unique
key, only the first row is used; the others are deleted.

@item
You can issue multiple @code{ADD}, @code{ALTER}, @code{DROP}, and
@code{CHANGE} clauses in a single @code{ALTER TABLE} statement. This is a
MySQL extension to standard SQL, which allows only one of each clause
per @code{ALTER TABLE} statement.

@item
@code{CHANGE col_name}, @code{DROP col_name}, and @code{DROP
INDEX} are MySQL extensions to standard SQL.

@item
@code{MODIFY} is an Oracle extension to @code{ALTER TABLE}.

@item
The optional word @code{COLUMN} is a pure noise word and can be omitted.

@item
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name RENAME TO new_tbl_name} without any other
options, MySQL simply renames any files that correspond to the table
@code{tbl_name}.  There is no need to create a temporary table.
You can also use the @code{RENAME TABLE} statement to rename tables.
@xref{RENAME TABLE,, @code{RENAME TABLE}}.

@item
@code{create_definition} clauses use the same syntax for @code{ADD} and
@code{CHANGE} as for @code{CREATE TABLE}.  Note that this syntax includes
the column name, not just the column type.
@xref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

@item
You can rename a column using a @code{CHANGE old_col_name create_definition}
clause.  To do so, specify the old and new column names and the type that
the column currently has.  For example, to rename an @code{INTEGER} column
from @code{a} to @code{b}, you can do this:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b INTEGER;
@end example

If you want to change a column's type but not the name, @code{CHANGE}
syntax still requires an old and new column name, even if they are the same.
For example:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b BIGINT NOT NULL;
@end example

However, as of MySQL 3.22.16a, you can also use @code{MODIFY}
to change a column's type without renaming it:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b BIGINT NOT NULL;
@end example

@item
If you use @code{CHANGE} or @code{MODIFY} to shorten a column for which
an index exists on part of the column (for example, if you have an index
on the first 10 characters of a @code{VARCHAR} column), you cannot make
the column shorter than the number of characters that are indexed.

@item
When you change a column type using @code{CHANGE} or @code{MODIFY}, MySQL
tries to convert existing column values to the new type as well as possible.

@item
In MySQL 3.22 or later, you can use @code{FIRST} or
@code{AFTER col_name} to add a column at a specific position
within a table row. The default is to add the column last.
From MySQL 4.0.1 on, you can also use @code{FIRST} and
@code{AFTER} in @code{CHANGE} or @code{MODIFY} operations.

@findex ALTER COLUMN
@cindex changing, column

@item
@code{ALTER COLUMN} specifies a new default value for a column
or removes the old default value.
If the old default is removed and the column can be @code{NULL}, the new
default is @code{NULL}. If the column cannot be @code{NULL}, MySQL
assigns a default value, as described in
@ref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

@findex DROP INDEX

@cindex index, deleting
@item
@code{DROP INDEX} removes an index. This is a MySQL extension to
standard SQL. @xref{DROP INDEX,  , @code{DROP INDEX}}.

@item
If columns are dropped from a table, the columns are also removed from any
index of which they are a part.  If all columns that make up an index are
dropped, the index is dropped as well.

@item
If a table contains only one column, the column cannot be dropped.
If what you intend is to remove the table, use @code{DROP TABLE} instead.

@findex DROP PRIMARY KEY
@cindex deleting, primary key
@cindex primary key, deleting
@item
@code{DROP PRIMARY KEY} drops the primary index. (Prior to MySQL 4.1.2,
if no primary index exists, @code{DROP PRIMARY KEY} drops the first
@code{UNIQUE} index in the table.
MySQL marks the first @code{UNIQUE} key as the @code{PRIMARY KEY}
if no @code{PRIMARY KEY} was specified explicitly.)

@findex UNIQUE
@findex PRIMARY KEY
If you add a @code{UNIQUE INDEX} or @code{PRIMARY KEY} to a table, this
is stored before any non-unique index so that MySQL can detect
duplicate keys as early as possible.

@findex ORDER BY
@item
@code{ORDER BY} allows you to create the new table with the rows in a
specific order.  Note that the table will not remain in this order after
inserts and deletes.  This option is mainly useful when you know that you
are mostly going to query the rows in a certain order; by using this option
after big changes to the table, you might be able to get higher performance.
In some cases, it might make sorting easier for MySQL if the table is in
order by the column that you want to order it by later.

@findex ALTER TABLE
@cindex changing, table
@cindex table, changing
@item
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} on a @code{MyISAM} table, all non-unique
indexes are created in a separate batch (like in @code{REPAIR}).
This should make @code{ALTER TABLE} much faster when you have many indexes.

Since MySQL 4.0, this feature can be activated explicitly.  @code{ALTER
TABLE ... DISABLE KEYS} makes MySQL to stop updating non-unique indexes for
@code{MyISAM} table.  @code{ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS} then should be used
to re-create missing indexes. MySQL does this with a special algorithm that
is much faster than inserting keys one by one, so disabling keys before
performing bulk insert operations should give a considerable speedup.

@item
@cindex foreign keys
@cindex references
The @code{FOREIGN KEY} and @code{REFERENCES} clauses are supported by the
@code{InnoDB} storage engine, which implements
@code{ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]] FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... (...)}
and (as of MySQL 4.0.13) @code{DROP FOREIGN KEY}.
@xref{InnoDB foreign key constraints,  , @code{InnoDB} foreign key constraints}.
For other storage engines, the clauses are parsed but ignored.
The @code{CHECK} clause is parsed but ignored for all storage engines.
The reason for accepting but ignoring syntax clauses is for compatibility,
to make it easier to port code from other SQL servers, and to run applications
that create tables with references.
@xref{Differences from ANSI}.

@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} ignores the @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX
DIRECTORY} table options.

@item
If you want to change all character columns (@code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR},
@code{TEXT}) to a new character set, use a statement like this:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name CHARACTER SET character_set_name;
@end example

This is useful, for example, after upgrading from MySQL 4.0.x to 4.1.1.

@strong{Warning:} The preceding operation will convert column values between
the character sets. This is NOT what you want if you have a column in
one character set (like @code{latin1}) but the stored values actually use
some other, incompatible character set (like @code{utf8}). In this case,
you have to do the following for each such column:

@example
ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE c1 c1 BLOB;
ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE c1 c1 TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8;
@end example

The reason this works is that there is no conversion when you convert
to or from @code{BLOB} columns.

Note that the following statement will change only the @emph{default} character
set for a table:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name DEFAULT CHARACTER SET character_set_name;
@end example

The default character set is the character set that is used if
you don't specify the character set for a new column you add to a table
(for example, with @code{ALTER TABLE ... ADD column}).

@item
@findex mysql_info()
With the @code{mysql_info()} C API function, you can find out how many
records were copied, and (when @code{IGNORE} is used) how many records were
deleted due to duplication of unique key values.
@xref{mysql_info,  , @code{mysql_info()}}.

@end itemize

Here are some examples that show uses of @code{ALTER TABLE}.
Begin with a table @code{t1} that is created as shown here:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a INTEGER,b CHAR(10));
@end example

To rename the table from @code{t1} to @code{t2}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME t2;
@end example

To change column @code{a} from @code{INTEGER} to @code{TINYINT NOT NULL}
(leaving the name the same), and to change column @code{b} from
@code{CHAR(10)} to @code{CHAR(20)} as well as renaming it from @code{b} to
@code{c}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 MODIFY a TINYINT NOT NULL, CHANGE b c CHAR(20);
@end example

To add a new @code{TIMESTAMP} column named @code{d}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD d TIMESTAMP;
@end example

To add indexes on column @code{d} and on column @code{a}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD INDEX (d), ADD INDEX (a);
@end example

To remove column @code{c}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c;
@end example

To add a new @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} integer column named @code{c}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE t2 ADD c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->     ADD PRIMARY KEY (c);
@end example

Note that we indexed @code{c} (as a @code{PRIMARY KEY}), because
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns must be indexed, and also that we declare
@code{c} as @code{NOT NULL}, because primary key columns cannot be
@code{NULL}.

When you add an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, column values are filled in
with sequence numbers for you automatically.  For @code{MyISAM} tables,
you can set the first
sequence number by executing @code{SET INSERT_ID=value} before
@code{ALTER TABLE} or by using the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT=value} table option.
@xref{SET OPTION,  , @code{SET OPTION}}.

With @code{MyISAM} tables, if you don't change the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
column, the sequence number will not be affected. If you drop an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column and then add another @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
column, the numbers are resequenced beginning with 1.

Rules for

As of MySQL 4.1.1, @code{create_specification} options can be given to

the default database character set.  The @code{COLLATE} clause specifies the
default database collation.  Database characteristics are stored in the
@file{db.opt} file in the database directory.

Databases in MySQL are implemented as directories containing files
that correspond to tables in the database.  Because there are no tables in a
database when it is initially created, the @code{CREATE DATABASE} statement
only creates a directory under the MySQL data directory (and the @file{db.opt}
file, for MySQL 4.1.1 and up).

@end example

@c description_for_help_topic CREATE INDEX  BTREE RTREE INDEX CREATE FULLTEXT SPATIAL
The @code{CREATE INDEX} statement doesn't do anything in MySQL prior
to Version 3.22.  In MySQL 3.22 or later, @code{CREATE INDEX} is mapped to an
@code{ALTER TABLE} statement to create indexes.
@c end_description_for_help_topic
@xref{ALTER TABLE, , @code{ALTER TABLE}}.

Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself
is created with @code{CREATE TABLE}.
@xref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.
@code{CREATE INDEX} allows you to add indexes to existing tables.

A column list of the form @code{(col1,col2,...)} creates a multiple-column
index.  Index values are formed by concatenating the values of the given
columns.

For @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} columns, indexes can be created that
use only part of a column, using @code{col_name(length)} syntax to index
a prefix consisting of the first @code{length} characters of each column
value. @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns also can be indexed, but a prefix
length @emph{must} be given.

The statement shown here creates an index using the first 10 characters
of the @code{name} column:

@example
mysql> CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));
@end example

Because most names usually differ in the first 10 characters, this index should
not be much slower than an index created from the entire @code{name} column.
Also, using partial columns for indexes can make the index file much smaller,
which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up @code{INSERT}
operations!

Prefixes can be up to 255 bytes long (or 1000 bytes for @code{MyISAM}
and @code{InnoDB} tables as of MySQL 4.1.2).  Note that prefix limits
are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in @code{CREATE INDEX}
statements is interpreted as number of characters.  Take this into account
when specifying a prefix length for a column that uses a multi-byte
character set.

Note that you can add an index on a column that can have @code{NULL}
values only if you are using MySQL 3.23.2 or newer and are using the
@code{MyISAM}, @code{InnoDB}, or @code{BDB} table type.  You can only add an
index on a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} column if you are using
MySQL 3.23.2 or newer and are using the @code{MyISAM} or @code{BDB}
table type, or MySQL 4.0.14 or newer and the @code{InnoDB} table type.

An @code{index_col_name} specification can end with @code{ASC} or @code{DESC}.
These keywords are allowed for future extensions for specifying ascending
or descending index value storage.  Currently they are parsed but ignored;
index values are always stored in ascending order.

For more information about how MySQL uses indexes, see
@ref{MySQL indexes, , MySQL indexes}.

@code{FULLTEXT} indexes can index only @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, and
@code{TEXT} columns, and only in @code{MyISAM} tables. @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
are available in MySQL 3.23.23 or later.
@ref{Fulltext Search}.

@code{SPATIAL} indexes can index only spatial columns,
and only in @code{MyISAM} tables. @code{SPATIAL} indexes
are available in MySQL 4.1 or later. Spatial column types are described in
@ref{Spatial extensions in MySQL}.

@code{CREATE TABLE} creates a table with the given name.
Rules for allowable table names are given in @ref{Legal names}.  
By default, the table is created in the current database.  
An error occurs if the table already exists, if there is no current database,
or if the database does not exist.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

In MySQL 3.22 or later, the table name can be specified as
@code{db_name.tbl_name} to create the table in a specific database.
This works regardless of whether there is a current database.
If you use quoted identifiers, quote the database and table names
separately. For example, @code{`mydb`.`mytbl`} is legal, but
@code{`mydb.mytbl`} is not.

From MySQL 3.23 on, you can use the @code{TEMPORARY} keyword when
creating a table. A @code{TEMPORARY} table is visible only to the
current connection, and is dropped automatically when the
connection is closed.  This means that two different
connections can use the same temporary table name without conflicting
with each other or with an existing table of the same name. (The existing table
is hidden until the temporary table is dropped.)  From MySQL 4.0.2 on, you must
have the @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES} privilege to be able to create
temporary tables.

In MySQL 3.23 or later, you can use the keywords
@code{IF NOT EXISTS} so that an error does not occur if the table already
exists.  Note that there is no verification that the existing table has a
structure identical to that indicated by the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.

From MySQL 4.1.0, the attribute @code{SERIAL} can be used as an alias for
@code{BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE}. This is a compatibility feature.

@cindex copying tables
@cindex tables, copying

As of MySQL 3.23, you can create one table from another by adding a
@code{SELECT} statement at the end of the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement:

@example
CREATE TABLE new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl;
@end example

Indexes are not carried over to the new table, and some conversion of column
types might occur. For example, the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} attribute is not
preserved, and @code{VARCHAR} columns can become @code{CHAR} columns.

When creating a table with @code{CREATE ... SELECT}, make sure to alias any
function calls or expressions in the query. If you do not, the @code{CREATE}
statement might fail or result in undesirable column names.

@example
CREATE TABLE artists_and_works
SELECT artist.name, COUNT(work.artist_id) AS number_of_works
FROM artist LEFT JOIN work ON artist.id = work.artist_id
GROUP BY artist.id;
@end example

As of MySQL 4.1, you can explicitly specify the type for a generated column:

@example
CREATE TABLE foo (a TINYINT NOT NULL) SELECT b+1 AS a FROM bar;
@end example

In MySQL 4.1, you can also use @code{LIKE} to create a table based on the
definition of another table, including any column attributes and
indexes the original table has:

@example
CREATE TABLE new_tbl LIKE orig_tbl;
@end example

@code{CREATE TABLE ... LIKE} does not copy any @code{DATA DIRECTORY} or
@code{INDEX DIRECTORY} table options that were specified for the original
table.

Each storage engine represents a table by an @file{.frm} table format
(definition) file in the database directory, and possibly other files.
In the case of @code{MyISAM} tables, the storage engine creates three files
for a table named @code{tbl_name}:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .40
@item @strong{File} @tab @strong{Purpose}
@item @code{tbl_name.frm} @tab Table format (definition) file
@item @code{tbl_name.MYD} @tab Data file
@item @code{tbl_name.MYI} @tab Index file
@end multitable

The files created by each storage engine to represent tables are described in
@ref{Table types}.

For general information on the properties of the various column types, see
@ref{Column types}.
For information about spatial column types, see
@ref{Spatial extensions in MySQL}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If neither @code{NULL} nor @code{NOT NULL} is specified, the column
is treated as though @code{NULL} had been specified.

@item
An integer column can have the additional attribute @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}.
When you insert a value of @code{NULL} (recommended) or @code{0} into an
indexed
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, the column is set to the next sequence value.
Typically this is @code{value+1}, where
@code{value} is the largest value for the column currently in the table.
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} sequences begin with @code{1}.
@xref{mysql_insert_id, , @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, specifying the @code{NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO} flag for the
@code{--sql-mode} server option or the @code{sql_mode} system variable allows
you to store @code{0} in @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns as @code{0}, without
generating a new sequence value.
@xref{Server options}.

If you delete the row containing the maximum value for an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, the value will be reused for an
@code{ISAM} or @code{BDB} table, but not for a
@code{MyISAM} or @code{InnoDB} table.  If you delete all rows in the table
with @code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} (without a @code{WHERE}) in
@code{AUTOCOMMIT} mode, the sequence starts over for all table types except
@code{InnoDB}.
@xref{InnoDB auto-increment column,  , @code{InnoDB} auto-increment column}.

@strong{Note:} There can be only one @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column per
table, it must be indexed, and it cannot have a @code{DEFAULT} value.
As of MySQL 3.23, an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column will work properly
only if it contains only positive values. Inserting a
negative number is regarded as inserting a very large positive number.
This is done to avoid precision problems when numbers ``wrap'' over from
positive to negative and also to ensure that you don't accidentally
get an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column that contains @code{0}.

For @code{MyISAM} and @code{BDB} tables, you can specify @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
secondary column in a multiple-column key.
@xref{example-AUTO_INCREMENT,  , example-@code{AUTO_INCREMENT}}.

@cindex ODBC compatibility
@cindex compatibility, with ODBC
To make MySQL compatible with some ODBC applications, you can find the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value for the last inserted row with the following query:

@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
@end example

@item
@code{NULL} values are handled differently for @code{TIMESTAMP} columns than
for other column types.  You cannot store a literal @code{NULL} in a
@code{TIMESTAMP} column; setting the column to @code{NULL} sets it to the
current date and time.  Because @code{TIMESTAMP} columns behave this way, the
@code{NULL} and @code{NOT NULL} attributes do not apply in the normal way and
are ignored if you specify them.

On the other hand, to make it easier for MySQL clients to use
@code{TIMESTAMP} columns, the server reports that such columns can be
assigned @code{NULL} values (which is true), even though @code{TIMESTAMP}
never actually will contain a @code{NULL} value.  You can see this when you
use @code{DESCRIBE tbl_name} to get a description of your table.

Note that setting a @code{TIMESTAMP} column to @code{0} is not the same
as setting it to @code{NULL}, because @code{0} is a valid @code{TIMESTAMP}
value.

@item
@cindex default values
A @code{DEFAULT} value must be a constant; it cannot be a function or
an expression.

If no @code{DEFAULT} value is specified for a column, MySQL
automatically assigns one, as follows.

If the column can take @code{NULL} as a value, the default value is
@code{NULL}.

If the column is declared as @code{NOT NULL}, the default value depends on
the column type:

@itemize @minus
@item
For numeric types other than those declared with the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
attribute, the default is @code{0}.  For an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, the
default value is the next value in the sequence.

@item
For date and time types other than @code{TIMESTAMP}, the default is the
appropriate ``zero'' value for the type.  For the first @code{TIMESTAMP}
column in a table, the default value is the current date and time.
@xref{Date and time types}.

@item
For string types other than @code{ENUM}, the default value is the empty
string.  For @code{ENUM}, the default is the first enumeration value.
@end itemize

Default values must be constants. This means, for example, that you cannot
set the default for a date column to be the value of a function such as
@code{NOW()} or @code{CURRENT_DATE}.

@code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns cannot be assigned a default value.

@item
@cindex column comments
A comment for a column can be specified with the @code{COMMENT} option.
The comment is displayed by the
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} and @code{SHOW FULL COLUMNS} statements.
This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.
(It is allowed but ignored in earlier versions.)

@item
@code{KEY} is normally a synonym for @code{INDEX}.
From MySQL 4.1, the key attribute @code{PRIMARY KEY} can also be
specified as just @code{KEY}. This was implemented for compatibility
with other database systems.

@item
In MySQL, a @code{UNIQUE} index is one in which all values in the index
must be distinct.  An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key
that matches an existing row.  The exception to this is that if a column
in the index is allowed to contain @code{NULL} values, it can contain
multiple @code{NULL} values.  This exception does not apply to @code{BDB}
tables, which allow only a single @code{NULL}.

@item
@tindex PRIMARY KEY
A @code{PRIMARY KEY} is a unique @code{KEY} where all key columns must be
defined as @code{NOT NULL}. If they are not explicitly declared as @code{NOT
NULL}, MySQL will declare them so implicitly (and quietly).  A table can
have only one @code{PRIMARY KEY}.  If you don't have a @code{PRIMARY KEY}
and an application asks for the @code{PRIMARY KEY} in your tables, MySQL
returns the first @code{UNIQUE} index that has no @code{NULL} columns as
the @code{PRIMARY KEY}.

@item
In the created table, a @code{PRIMARY KEY} is placed first, followed
by all @code{UNIQUE} keys, and then the normal keys.  This helps the
MySQL optimizer to prioritize which index to use and also more quickly
to detect duplicated @code{UNIQUE} keys.

@item
A @code{PRIMARY KEY} can be a multiple-column index.  However, you cannot
create a multiple-column index using the @code{PRIMARY KEY} key attribute in a
column specification.  Doing so will mark only that single column as primary.
You must use a separate @code{PRIMARY KEY(index_col_name, ...)} clause.


@item
If a @code{PRIMARY KEY} or @code{UNIQUE} index consists of only one column
that has an integer type, you can also refer to the column as @code{_rowid}
(new in MySQL 3.23.11).

@item
In MySQL, the name of a @code{PRIMARY KEY} is @code{PRIMARY}.  For other
indexes, if you don't assign a name, the index is assigned the same name as
the first indexed column, with an optional suffix (@code{_2}, @code{_3},
@code{...}) to make it unique.  You can see index names for a table using
@code{SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name}.
@xref{Show database info}.

@item
From MySQL 4.1.0 on, some storage engines allow you to specify an index
type when creating an index.  The syntax for the @code{index_type}
specifier is @code{USING type_name}. The allowable @code{type_name}
values supported by different storage engines are shown in the following
table. Where multiple index types are listed, the first one is the
default when no @code{index_type} specifier is given.

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .50
@item @strong{Storage Engine} @tab @strong{Allowable Index Types}
@item @code{MyISAM} @tab @code{BTREE}
@item @code{InnoDB} @tab @code{BTREE}
@item @code{MEMORY/HEAP} @tab @code{HASH}, @code{BTREE}
@end multitable

Example:

@example
CREATE TABLE lookup
    (id INT, INDEX USING BTREE (id))
    ENGINE = MEMORY;
@end example

@code{TYPE type_name} can be used as a synonym for @code{USING type_name}
to specify an index type.  @code{USING} is the preferred form, however.
Also, the index name name that precedes the index type in the index
specification syntax is not optional with @code{TYPE}. This is because,
unlike @code{USING}, @code{TYPE} is not a reserved word and thus is
interpreted as an index name.

If you specify an index type that is not legal for a storage engine,
but there is another available index type the engine can use that will
not affect query results, the engine will use the available type.

@item
@cindex @code{NULL} values, and indexes
@cindex indexes, and @code{NULL} values
Only the @code{MyISAM}, @code{InnoDB}, @code{BDB}, and (as of MySQL 4.0.2)
@code{MEMORY} storage engines support indexes on columns that can have
@code{NULL} values. In other cases, you must declare indexed columns
@code{NOT NULL} or an error results.

@item
With @code{col_name(length)} syntax in an index specification, you can create
an index that uses only the first @code{length} characters of a @code{CHAR}
or @code{VARCHAR} column. Indexing only a prefix of column values like this
can make the index file much smaller.
@xref{Indexes}.

@cindex @code{BLOB} columns, indexing
@cindex indexes, and @code{BLOB} columns
@cindex @code{TEXT} columns, indexing
@cindex indexes, and @code{TEXT} columns
The @code{MyISAM} and (as of MySQL 4.0.14) @code{InnoDB} table types also
support indexing on @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns.  When indexing
a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} column, you @emph{must} specify a prefix
length for the index. For example:

@example
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
@end example

Prefixes can be up to 255 bytes long (or 1000 bytes for @code{MyISAM}
and @code{InnoDB} tables as of MySQL 4.1.2).  Note that prefix limits
are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in @code{CREATE TABLE}
statements is interpreted as number of characters.  Take this into account
when specifying a prefix length for a column that uses a multi-byte
character set.

@item
An @code{index_col_name} specification can end with @code{ASC} or @code{DESC}.
These keywords are allowed for future extensions for specifying ascending
or descending index value storage.  Currently they are parsed but ignored;
index values are always stored in ascending order.

@item
When you use @code{ORDER BY} or @code{GROUP BY} with a @code{TEXT} or
@code{BLOB} column, the server sorts values using only the initial number of
bytes indicated by the @code{max_sort_length} system variable.
@xref{BLOB,  , @code{BLOB}}.

@item
In MySQL 3.23.23 or later, you can create special
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
@code{MyISAM} table type supports @code{FULLTEXT} indexes. They can be created
only from @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, and @code{TEXT} columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column; partial indexing is not
supported. See @ref{Fulltext Search} for details of operation.

@item
In MySQL 3.23.44 or later, @code{InnoDB} tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. @xref{InnoDB,  , @code{InnoDB}}. Note that the
@code{FOREIGN KEY} syntax in @code{InnoDB} is more restrictive than
the syntax presented for the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement at the beginning of
this section: The columns of the referenced
table must always be explicitly named.
@code{InnoDB} supports both @code{ON DELETE} and @code{ON UPDATE}
actions on foreign keys as of MySQL 3.23.50 and 4.0.8, respectively.
For the precise syntax, see
@ref{InnoDB foreign key constraints,  , @code{InnoDB} foreign key constraints}.

For other storage engines, MySQL Server parses the @code{FOREIGN KEY}
and @code{REFERENCES} syntax in @code{CREATE TABLE} statements,
but without further action being taken.
The @code{CHECK} clause is parsed and ignored for all storage engines.
 @xref{ANSI diff Foreign Keys}.

@item
For @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables,
each @code{NULL} column takes one bit extra, rounded up to the nearest byte.
The maximum record length in bytes can be calculated as follows:

@example
row length = 1
             + (sum of column lengths)
             + (number of NULL columns + delete_flag + 7)/8
             + (number of variable-length columns)
@end example

@code{delete_flag} is 1 for tables with static record format. Static
tables use a bit in the row record for a flag that indicates whether
the row has been deleted.  @code{delete_flag} is 0 for dynamic tables
because the flag is stored in the dynamic row header.

These calculations do not apply for @code{InnoDB} tables, for which
storage size is not different for @code{NULL} columns compared to @code{NOT
NULL} columns.

@end itemize

The @code{table_options} part of the @code{CREATE TABLE} syntax can be used
in MySQL 3.23 and above.

The @code{ENGINE} and @code{TYPE} options specify the storage engine for the
table.  @code{ENGINE} was added in MySQL 4.0.18 (for 4.0) and 4.1.2 (for 4.1).
It is the preferred option name as of those versions, and @code{TYPE} has
become deprecated.  @code{TYPE} will be supported throughout the 4.x series,
but likely will be removed in MySQL 5.1.

The @code{ENGINE} and @code{TYPE} options take the following values:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .70
@item @strong{Storage Engine} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{BDB} @tab Transaction-safe tables with page locking. @xref{BDB,  , @code{BDB}}.
@item @code{BerkeleyDB} @tab An alias for @code{BDB}.
@item @code{HEAP} @tab The data for this table is only stored in memory.  @xref{HEAP,  , @code{HEAP}}.
@item @code{ISAM} @tab The original MySQL storage engine. @xref{ISAM,  , @code{ISAM}}.
@item @code{InnoDB} @tab Transaction-safe tables with row locking.  @xref{InnoDB,  , @code{InnoDB}}.
@item @code{MEMORY} @tab An alias for @code{HEAP}. (Actually, as of MySQL 4.1, @code{MEMORY} is the preferred term.)
@item @code{MERGE} @tab A collection of @code{MyISAM} tables used as one table. @xref{MERGE,  , @code{MERGE}}.
@item @code{MRG_MyISAM} @tab An alias for @code{MERGE}.
@item @code{MyISAM} @tab The binary portable storage engine that is the improved replacement for @code{ISAM}. @xref{MyISAM, , @code{MyISAM}}.
@end multitable

@xref{Table types}.

If a storage engine is specified and that particular engine is not available,
MySQL uses @code{MyISAM} instead.
For example, if a table definition includes the @code{ENGINE=BDB} option but the
MySQL server does not support @code{BDB} tables, the table is created
as a @code{MyISAM} table.  This makes it possible to have a replication
setup where you have transactional tables on the master but tables created
on the slave are non-transactional (to get more speed).  In MySQL 4.1.1, a
warning occurs if the storage engine specification is not honored.

The other table options are used to optimize the behavior of the
table. In most cases, you don't have to specify any of them.
The options work for all storage engines unless otherwise indicated:

@table @code

@item AUTO_INCREMENT
The initial @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value for the table. This works for
@code{MyISAM} only. To set the first auto-increment value for an @code{InnoDB}
table, insert a dummy row with a value one less than the desired value after
creating the table, and then delete the dummy row.

@item AVG_ROW_LENGTH
An approximation of the average row length for your table. You need to
set this only for large tables with variable-size records.

When you create a @code{MyISAM} table, MySQL uses the product of
@code{MAX_ROWS * AVG_ROW_LENGTH} to decide how big the resulting table
will be.  If you don't specify either of these options, the maximum size
for a table will be 4GB (or 2GB if your operating system only supports 2GB
tables). The reason for this is just to keep down the pointer sizes
to make the index smaller and faster if you don't really need big files.
If you want all your tables to be able to grow above the 4GB limit and are
willing to have your smaller tables slightly slower and larger than
necessary, you may increase the default pointer size by setting the
@code{myisam_data_pointer_size} system variable, which was added in MySQL
4.1.2.
@xref{Server system variables, @code{myisam_data_pointer_size}}.

@item CHECKSUM
Set this to 1 if you want MySQL to maintain a live checksum for all rows
that is updated automatically as the table changes. This makes the table a
little slower to update, but also makes it easier to find corrupted tables.
The @code{CHECKSUM TABLE} statement reports the checksum.
(@code{MyISAM} only.)

@item COMMENT
A 60-character comment for your table.

@item MAX_ROWS
The maximum number of rows you plan to store in the table.

@item MIN_ROWS
The minimum number of rows you plan to store in the table.

@item PACK_KEYS
Set this option to 1 if you want to have smaller indexes.  This usually
makes updates slower and reads faster.
Setting the option to 0 disables all packing of keys. Setting it to
@code{DEFAULT} (MySQL 4.0) tells the storage engine to only pack long
@code{CHAR}/@code{VARCHAR} columns.
(@code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} only.)

If you don't use @code{PACK_KEYS}, the default is to only pack strings,
not numbers.  If you use @code{PACK_KEYS=1}, numbers will be packed as well.

When packing binary number keys, MySQL uses prefix compression:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Every key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the previous
key are the same for the next key.

@item
The pointer to the row is stored in high-byte-first order directly after
the key, to improve compression.

@end itemize

This means that if you have many equal keys on two consecutive rows,
all following ``same'' keys will usually only take two bytes (including the
pointer to the row).  Compare this to the ordinary case where the following
keys will take @code{storage_size_for_key + pointer_size} (where the pointer
size is usually 4). Conversely,
you will get a big benefit from prefix compression only if you have many
numbers that are the same.  If all keys are totally different, you will
use one byte more per key, if the key isn't a key that can have @code{NULL}
values. (In this case, the packed key length will be stored in the same
byte that is used to mark if a key is @code{NULL}.)

@item PASSWORD
Encrypt the @file{.frm} file with a password.  This option doesn't do anything in the standard MySQL version.

@item DELAY_KEY_WRITE
Set this to 1 if you want to delay key updates for the table until the table
is closed. (@code{MyISAM} only.)

@item ROW_FORMAT
Defines how the rows should be stored. Currently this option works only with
@code{MyISAM} tables. The option value can @code{FIXED} or @code{DYNAMIC} for
static or variable-length row format. @code{myisampack} sets the type to
@code{COMPRESSED}.
@xref{MyISAM table formats,  , @code{MyISAM} table formats}.

@item RAID_TYPE
@cindex RAID, table type
@cindex tables, RAID
The @code{RAID_TYPE} option will help you to exceed the 2GB/4GB limit for
the @code{MyISAM} data file (not the index file) on operating systems that
don't support big files. This option is unnecessary and not recommended for
filesystems that support big files.

You can get more speed from the I/O bottleneck by putting @code{RAID}
directories on different physical disks.  For now, the only allowed
@code{RAID_TYPE} is @code{STRIPED}. @code{1} and @code{RAID0} are aliases
for @code{STRIPED}.

If you specify the @code{RAID_TYPE} option for a @code{MyISAM} table,
specify the @code{RAID_CHUNKS} and @code{RAID_CHUNKSIZE} options as well.
@code{MyISAM} will create @code{RAID_CHUNKS} subdirectories named @file{00},
@file{01}, @file{02}, ... @file{09}, @file{0a}, @file{0b}, ... @file{ff}
in the database directory.  In each of these directories, @code{MyISAM}
will create a file @file{tbl_name.MYD}.  When writing data to the data file,
the @code{RAID} handler maps the first @code{RAID_CHUNKSIZE*1024} bytes to
the first file, the next @code{RAID_CHUNKSIZE*1024} bytes to the next file,
and so on.

@code{RAID_TYPE} works on any operating system, as long as you have built
MySQL with the @code{--with-raid} option to @code{configure}. To determine
whether a server supports @code{RAID} tables, use @code{SHOW VARIABLES LIKE
'have_raid'} to see whether the variable value is @code{YES}.

@item UNION
@code{UNION} is used when you want to use a collection of identical
tables as one. This works only with @code{MERGE} tables.
@xref{MERGE, , @code{MERGE}}.

For the moment, you must have @code{SELECT}, @code{UPDATE}, and
@code{DELETE} privileges for the tables you map to a @code{MERGE} table.
Originally, all used tables had to be in the same database
as the @code{MERGE} table itself. This restriction has been lifted as of
MySQL 4.1.1.

@item INSERT_METHOD
If you want to insert data in a @code{MERGE} table, you have to specify with
@code{INSERT_METHOD} into which table the row should be inserted.
@code{INSERT_METHOD} is an option useful for @code{MERGE} tables only. 
This option was introduced in MySQL 4.0.0.
@xref{MERGE,  , @code{MERGE}}.

@item DATA DIRECTORY
@itemx INDEX DIRECTORY
By using @code{DATA DIRECTORY='directory'} or @code{INDEX
DIRECTORY='directory'} you can specify where the @code{MyISAM} storage engine should
put a table's data file and index file.  Note that the directory should be a full
path to the directory (not a relative path).

These options work only for @code{MyISAM} tables from MySQL 4.0 on, when
you are not using the @code{--skip-symlink} option. Your operating system
must also have a working, thread-safe @code{realpath()} call.
@xref{Symbolic links to tables}.

@end table

As of MySQL 3.23, you can specify a @code{SELECT} at the end of the
@code{CREATE} statement.  MySQL will create new column for all elements
in the @code{SELECT}.  For example:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->        PRIMARY KEY (a), KEY(b))
    ->        TYPE=MyISAM SELECT b,c FROM test2;
@end example

This creates a @code{MyISAM} table with three columns, @code{a}, @code{b},
and @code{c}.  Notice that the columns from the @code{SELECT} statement
are appended to the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it.
Take the following example:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM foo;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+

mysql> CREATE TABLE bar (m INT) SELECT n FROM foo;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM bar;
+------+---+
| m    | n |
+------+---+
| NULL | 1 |
+------+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

For each row in table @code{foo}, a row is inserted in @code{bar} with
the values from @code{foo} and default values for the new columns.

@code{CREATE TABLE ... SELECT} will not automatically create any indexes
for you.  This is done intentionally to make the statement as flexible as
possible.  If you want to have indexes in the created table, you should
specify these before the @code{SELECT} statement:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE bar (UNIQUE (n)) SELECT n FROM foo;
@end example

If any errors occur while copying the data to the table, it will
automatically be deleted.

You can precede the @code{SELECT} by @code{IGNORE} or @code{REPLACE}
to indicate how to handle records that duplicate unique key values.
With @code{IGNORE}, new records that duplicate an existing record on a
unique key value are discarded.  With @code{REPLACE}, new records replace
records that have the same unique key value.  If neither @code{IGNORE}
nor @code{REPLACE} is specified, duplicate unique key values result in
an error.

To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
@code{CREATE TABLE ... SELECT}.


@node Silent column changes,  , CREATE TABLE, CREATE TABLE
@subsubsection Silent Column Specification Changes

@cindex silent column changes

In some cases, MySQL silently changes column specifications from
those given in a @code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{ALTER TABLE} statement:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{VARCHAR} columns with a length less than four are changed to
@code{CHAR}.

@item
If any column in a table has a variable length, the entire row becomes
variable-length as a result.  Therefore, if a table contains any
variable-length columns (@code{VARCHAR}, @code{TEXT}, or @code{BLOB}),
all @code{CHAR} columns longer than three characters are changed to
@code{VARCHAR} columns.  This doesn't affect how you use the columns in
any way; in MySQL, @code{VARCHAR} is just a different way to
store characters.  MySQL performs this conversion because it
saves space and makes table operations faster.  @xref{Table types}.

@item
From MySQL 4.1.0 on, a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} column with a
length specification greater than 255 is converted to the smallest @code{TEXT}
type that can hold values of the given length.
For example, @code{VARCHAR(500)} is converted to @code{TEXT}, and
@code{VARCHAR(200000)} is converted to @code{MEDIUMTEXT}.
This is a compatibility feature.

@item
@code{TIMESTAMP} display sizes are discarded from MySQL 4.1 on, due
to changes made to the @code{TIMESTAMP} column type in that version.
Before MySQL 4.1, @code{TIMESTAMP} display sizes must be even and in the
range from 2 to 14.  If you specify a display size of 0 or greater than
14, the size is coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to
13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

@item
You cannot store a literal @code{NULL} in a @code{TIMESTAMP} column; setting
it to @code{NULL} sets it to the current date and time.  Because
@code{TIMESTAMP} columns behave this way, the @code{NULL} and @code{NOT NULL}
attributes do not apply in the normal way and are ignored if you specify
them.  @code{DESCRIBE tbl_name} always reports that a @code{TIMESTAMP}
column can be assigned @code{NULL} values.

The @code{TEMPORARY} keyword is ignored in MySQL 4.0.  As of 4.1, it has the

RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name

@end example

This statement renames one or more tables.  It was added in MySQL 3.23.23.

The rename operation is done atomically, which means that no other thread
can access any of the tables while the rename is running. For example,
if you have an existing table @code{old_table}, you can create another
table @code{new_table} that has the same structure but is empty, and then
replace the existing table with the empty one as follows:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic RENAME TABLE
@example
CREATE TABLE new_table (...);
RENAME TABLE old_table TO backup_table, new_table TO old_table;
@end example

If the statement renames more than one table, renaming operations are done
from left to right. If you want to swap two table names, you can do so
like this (assuming that no table named @code{tmp_table} currently exists):

@example
RENAME TABLE old_table TO tmp_table,
             new_table TO old_table,
             tmp_table TO new_table;
@end example

As long as two databases are on the same filesystem you can also rename
from one database to another:

@example
RENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;
@end example

When you execute @code{RENAME}, you can't have any locked tables or
active transactions.  You must also have the @code{ALTER} and @code{DROP}
privileges on the original table, and the @code{CREATE} and @code{INSERT}
privileges on the new table.

If MySQL encounters any errors in a multiple-table rename, it
will do a reverse rename for all renamed tables to get everything back
to the original state.

The @code{USE db_name} statement tells MySQL to use the @code{db_name}
database as the default (current) database for subsequent queries.
The database remains the default until the end of the session or until
another @code{USE} statement is issued:

@findex START TRANSACTION

@findex COMMIT
@findex ROLLBACK

@c description_for_help_topic START TRANSACTION  START TRANSACTION BEGIN WORK COMMIT ROLLBACK SET AUTOCOMMIT
By default, MySQL runs autocommit mode enabled. This means that
as soon as you execute a statement that updates (modifies) a table,
MySQL stores the update on disk.

If you are using transaction-safe tables (like @code{InnoDB} or @code{BDB}),
you can disable autocommit mode with the following statement:

@example
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
@end example

After disabling autocommit mode by setting the @code{AUTOCOMMIT} variable to
zero, you must use @code{COMMIT} to store your changes to disk or
@code{ROLLBACK} if you want to ignore the changes you have made since
the beginning of your transaction.

If you want to disable autocommit mode for a single series of
statements, you can use the @code{START TRANSACTION} statement:
@c end_description_for_help_topic
:

@c example_for_help_topic START TRANSACTION
@example
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @@A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summary=@@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;
@end example

With @code{START TRANSACTION}, autocommit remains disabled until you end the
transaction with @code{COMMIT} or @code{ROLLBACK}. The autocommit mode then
reverts to its previous state.

@code{BEGIN} and @code{BEGIN WORK} can be used instead of @code{START
TRANSACTION} to initiate a transaction.  @code{START TRANSACTION} was
added in MySQL 4.0.11.  This is standard SQL syntax and is the recommended way
to start an ad-hoc transaction.  @code{BEGIN} and @code{BEGIN WORK} are
available from MySQL 3.23.17 and 3.23.19, respectively.

Note that if you are not using transaction-safe tables, any changes are
stored at once, regardless of the status of autocommit mode.

If you issue a @code{ROLLBACK} statement after updating a non-transactional
table within a transaction, an @code{ER_WARNING_NOT_COMPLETE_ROLLBACK}
warning occurs.  Changes to transaction-safe tables will be rolled back, but
not changes to non-transaction-safe tables.

If you are using @code{START TRANSACTION} or @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT=0}, you
should use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the
older update log.  Transactions are stored in the binary log
in one chunk, upon @code{COMMIT}. Transactions that are
rolled back are not logged.  @xref{Binary log}.

You can change the isolation level for transactions with
@code{SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL}.
@xref{SET TRANSACTION,  , @code{SET TRANSACTION}}.


@node Cannot roll back, Implicit commit, COMMIT, Transactional Commands
@subsection Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back

Some statements cannot be rolled back.  In general, these include data
definition language (DDL) statements, such as those that create or drop
databases, or those that create, drop, or alter tables.

You should design your transactions not to include such statements.
If you issue a statement that cannot be rolled back early in a transaction,
and then another statement later fails, the full effect of the transaction
cannot be rolled back by issuing a @code{ROLLBACK} statement.


@node Implicit commit, Savepoints, Cannot roll back, Transactional Commands
@subsection Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit

The following statements implicitly end a transaction (as if you had done
a @code{COMMIT} before executing the statement):

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .25 .25
@item @strong{Statement}    @tab @strong{Statement} @tab @strong{Statement}
@item @code{ALTER TABLE}    @tab @code{BEGIN}       @tab @code{CREATE INDEX}
@item @code{DROP DATABASE}  @tab @code{DROP INDEX}  @tab @code{DROP TABLE}
@item @code{LOAD MASTER DATA} @tab @code{LOCK TABLES} @tab @code{RENAME TABLE}
@item @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT=1} @tab @code{START TRANSACTION} @tab @code{TRUNCATE TABLE}
@end multitable

@code{UNLOCK TABLES} also ends a transaction if any tables currently are
locked.  Prior to MySQL 4.0.13, @code{CREATE TABLE} ends a transaction if
the binary update log is enabled.

Transactions cannot be nested. This is a consequence of the implicit
@code{COMMIT} performed for any current transaction when you issue a
@code{START TRANSACTION} statement or one of its synonyms.


@node Savepoints, LOCK TABLES, Implicit commit, Transactional Commands
@subsection @code{SAVEPOINT} and @code{ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT} Syntax

@c help_category Transactions
@c description_for_help_topic SAVEPOINT  ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT
@example
SAVEPOINT identifier
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT identifier
@end example

Starting from MySQL 4.0.14 and 4.1.1, @code{InnoDB} supports the SQL statements
@code{SAVEPOINT} and @code{ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The @code{SAVEPOINT} statement sets a named transaction savepoint with a name
of @code{identifier}.  If the current transaction already has a savepoint
with the same name, the old savepoint is deleted and a new one is set.

The @code{ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT} statement rolls back a transaction to the
named savepoint.  Modifications that the current transaction made to rows
after the savepoint was set are undone in the rollback, but @code{InnoDB}
does @emph{not} release the row locks that were stored in memory after
the savepoint.  (Note that for a new inserted row, the lock information is
carried by the transaction ID stored in the row; the lock is not separately
stored in memory. In this case, the row lock is released in the undo.)
Savepoints that were set at a later time than the named savepoint are
deleted.

If the statement returns the following error, it means that
no savepoint with the specified name exists:

@example
ERROR 1181: Got error 153 during ROLLBACK
@end example

All savepoints of the current transaction are deleted if you execute a
@code{COMMIT}, or a @code{ROLLBACK} that does not name a savepoint.

UNLOCK TABLES
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic LOCK  LOCK UNLOCK TABLES AS READ LOCAL LOW_PRIORITY WRITE
@code{LOCK TABLES} locks tables for the current thread.  @code{UNLOCK
TABLES} releases any locks held by the current thread.  All tables that
are locked by the current thread are implicitly unlocked when the
thread issues another @code{LOCK TABLES}, or when the connection to the
server is closed.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@strong{Note:} @code{LOCK TABLES} is not transaction-safe and implicitly
commits any active transactions before attempting to lock the tables.

As of MySQL 4.0.2, to use @code{LOCK TABLES} you must have the global
@code{LOCK TABLES} privilege and a @code{SELECT} privilege for the
involved tables. In MySQL 3.23, you must have @code{SELECT},
@code{INSERT}, @code{DELETE}, and @code{UPDATE} privileges for the
tables.

The main reasons to use @code{LOCK TABLES} are for emulating transactions
or to get more speed when updating tables.  This is explained in more
detail later.

If a thread obtains a @code{READ} lock on a table, that thread (and all other
threads) can only read from the table. If a thread obtains a @code{WRITE}
lock on a table, only the thread holding the lock can read from
or write to the table.  Other threads are blocked.

The difference between @code{READ LOCAL} and @code{READ} is that
@code{READ LOCAL} allows non-conflicting @code{INSERT} statements to
execute while the lock is held.  However, this can't be used if you are
going to manipulate the database files outside MySQL while you
hold the lock.

When you use @code{LOCK TABLES}, you must lock all tables that you are
going to use in your queries.  If you are using a table multiple times
in a query (with aliases), you must get a lock for each alias. While
the locks obtained with a @code{LOCK TABLES} statement are in effect,
you cannot access any tables that were not locked by the statement.

If your queries refer to a table using an alias, then you must lock the
table using that same alias.  It will not work to lock the table without
specifying the alias:

@example
mysql> LOCK TABLE t READ;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t AS myalias;
ERROR 1100: Table 'myalias' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
@end example

Conversely, if you lock a table using an alias, you must refer to it in
your queries using that alias:

@example
mysql> LOCK TABLE t AS myalias READ;
mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
ERROR 1100: Table 't' was not locked with LOCK TABLES
mysql> SELECT * FROM t AS myalias;
@end example

@code{WRITE} locks normally have higher priority than @code{READ} locks to
ensure that updates are processed as soon as possible. This means that if one
thread obtains a @code{READ} lock and then another thread requests a
@code{WRITE} lock, subsequent @code{READ} lock requests will wait until the
@code{WRITE} thread has gotten the lock and released it.  You can use
@code{LOW_PRIORITY WRITE} locks to allow other threads to obtain @code{READ}
locks while the thread is waiting for the @code{WRITE} lock. You should
use @code{LOW_PRIORITY WRITE} locks only if you are sure that there will
eventually be a time when no threads will have a @code{READ} lock.

@code{LOCK TABLES} works as follows:

@enumerate
@item
Sort all tables to be locked in an internally defined order. From the
user standpoint, this order is undefined.
@item
If a table is locked with a read and a write lock, put the write lock
before the read lock.
@item
Lock one table at a time until the thread gets all locks.
@end enumerate

This policy ensures that table locking is deadlock free. There are,
however, other things you need to be aware of with this schema:

If you are using a @code{LOW_PRIORITY WRITE} lock for a table, it
means only that MySQL will wait for this particular lock until
there are no threads that want a @code{READ} lock.  When the thread has
gotten the @code{WRITE} lock and is waiting to get the lock for the next
table in the lock table list, all other threads will wait for the
@code{WRITE} lock to be released.  If this becomes a serious problem
with your application, you should consider converting some of your
tables to transaction-safe tables.

You can safely use @code{KILL} to terminate a thread that is waiting for a
table lock.
@xref{KILL,  , @code{KILL}}.

Note that you should @emph{not} lock any tables that you are using with
@code{INSERT DELAYED}. This is because, in this case, the @code{INSERT}
is done by a separate thread.

Normally, you don't have to lock tables, because all single @code{UPDATE} statements
are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any other currently executing
SQL statement. There are a few cases when you would like to lock tables
anyway:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are going to run many operations on a set of tables, it's much
faster to lock the tables you are going to use.  The downside is
that no thread can update a @code{READ}-locked table (including the one
holding the lock) and no thread can read a @code{WRITE}-locked table other
than the one holding the lock.

The reason some operations are faster under @code{LOCK TABLES} is that
MySQL will not flush the key cache for the locked tables until
@code{UNLOCK TABLES} is called. Normally, the key cache is flushed after
each SQL statement. Locking @code{MyISAM} tables speeds up inserting,
updating, or deleting on them.
@item
If you are using a storage engine in MySQL that doesn't support
transactions, you must use @code{LOCK TABLES} if you want to ensure that
no other thread comes between a @code{SELECT} and an @code{UPDATE}. The
example shown here requires @code{LOCK TABLES} to execute safely:

@example
mysql> LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
mysql> SELECT SUM(value) FROM trans WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql> UPDATE customer
    ->     SET total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
    ->     WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

Without @code{LOCK TABLES}, it is possible that another thread might
insert a new row in the @code{trans} table between execution of the
@code{SELECT} and @code{UPDATE} statements.
@end itemize

You can avoid using @code{LOCK TABLES} in many cases
by using relative updates (@code{UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value}) or the @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} function,
@xref{ANSI diff Transactions}.

You can also avoid locking tables in some cases by using the user-level
advisory lock functions @code{GET_LOCK()} and @code{RELEASE_LOCK()}.
These locks are saved in a hash table in the server and implemented with
@code{pthread_mutex_lock()} and @code{pthread_mutex_unlock()} for high speed.
@xref{Miscellaneous functions}.

See @ref{Internal locking}, for more information on locking policy.

You can lock all tables in all databases with read locks with the @code{FLUSH
TABLES WITH READ LOCK} statement. @xref{FLUSH,  , @code{FLUSH}}. This
is a very convenient way to get backups if you have a filesystem such as
Veritas that can take snapshots in time.

@strong{Note:} If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} on a locked table, it may become
unlocked. @xref{ALTER TABLE problems}.

This statement
sets the transaction isolation level for the next transaction, globally, or

The default behavior of @code{SET TRANSACTION} is to set the isolation level
for the next (not yet

sets the default transaction level globally for all new connections
created from that point on. Existing connections are unaffected.
You need the @code{SUPER}

The @code{DROP USER} statement deletes a MySQL account that
doesn't have any privileges.  It serves to remove the account record from
the @code{user} table. The account is named using the same format as for
@code{GRANT} or @code{REVOKE}; for example, @code{'jeffrey'@@'localhost'}.
The user and host parts of the account name correspond to the @code{User} and
@code{Host} column values of the @code{user} table record for the account.

To remove a MySQL user account, you should use the following procedure,
performing the steps in the order shown:

@enumerate
@item
Use @code{SHOW GRANTS} to determine what privileges the account has.
@xref{SHOW GRANTS,  , @code{SHOW GRANTS}}.

@code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} are implemented in MySQL 3.22.11 or
later. For earlier MySQL versions, these statements do nothing.

The @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements allow system administrators
to create user accounts and to grant and revoke rights to MySQL accounts at
four privilege levels:

@table @strong
@item Global level
Global privileges apply to all databases on a given server. These privileges
are stored in the @code{mysql.user} table.
@code{GRANT ALL ON *.*} and
@code{REVOKE ALL ON *.*} grant and revoke only global privileges.

@item Database level
Database privileges apply to all tables in a given database. These privileges
are stored in the @code{mysql.db} and @code{mysql.host} tables.
@code{GRANT ALL ON db.*} and
@code{REVOKE ALL ON db.*} grant and revoke only database privileges.

@item Table level
Table privileges apply to all columns in a given table. These privileges are
stored in the @code{mysql.tables_priv} table.
@code{GRANT ALL ON db.table} and
@code{REVOKE ALL ON db.table} grant and revoke only table privileges.

@item Column level
Column privileges apply to single columns in a given table. These privileges are
stored in the @code{mysql.columns_priv} table.
When using @code{REVOKE}, you must specify the same columns that were granted.
@end table
@c end_description_for_help_topic

To make it easy to revoke all privileges for a user, MySQL 4.1.2 has
added the syntax:

@example
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM user_name [, user_name] ...
@end example

This drops all database-, table-, and column-level privileges for the
user.

@c description_for_help_topic GRANT types
For the @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} statements, @code{priv_type} can be
specified as any of the following:

@c FIX agl 2002-06-13 New table, need to measure colwidths!

@end multitable
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{USAGE} can be used when you want to create a user that has no privileges.

The privileges @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES}, @code{EXECUTE},
@code{LOCK TABLES}, @code{REPLICATION ...}, @code{SHOW DATABASES} and
@code{SUPER} are new for in MySQL 4.0.2.  To use these new privileges
after upgrading to 4.0.2, you must run the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script.
@xref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.

In older MySQL versions that do not have the @code{SUPER} privilege, the
@code{PROCESS} privilege can be used instead.

To revoke the @code{GRANT OPTION} privilege from a user, use a @code{priv_type}
value of @code{GRANT OPTION}:

@example
mysql> REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON ... FROM ...;
@end example

The only @code{priv_type} values you can specify for a table are @code{SELECT},
@code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}, @code{CREATE}, @code{DROP},
@code{GRANT OPTION}, @code{INDEX}, and @code{ALTER}.

The only @code{priv_type} values you can specify for a column (that is, when
you use a @code{column_list} clause) are @code{SELECT}, @code{INSERT}, and
@code{UPDATE}.

MySQL allows you to create database level privileges even if the database
doesn't exist, to make it easy to prepare for database use.  However, MySQL
currently does not allow you to create table-level grants if the table
doesn't exist.

MySQL will not automatically revoke any privileges even if you drop a table
or drop a database.

You can set global privileges by using @code{ON *.*} syntax.  You can set
database privileges by using @code{ON db_name.*} syntax. If you specify
@code{ON *} and you have a current database, the privileges will be granted in
that database.  (@strong{Warning:} If you specify @code{ON *} and you
@emph{don't} have a current database, the privileges granted will be global!)

@strong{Note:} the @samp{_} and @samp{%} wildcards are allowed when
specifying database names in @code{GRANT} statements that grant privileges at
the global or database levels. This means, for example, that if you
want to use a @samp{_} character as part of a database name,
you should specify it as @samp{\_} in the @code{GRANT} statement, to prevent
the user from being able to access additional databases matching the
wildcard pattern; for example, @code{GRANT ... ON `foo\_bar`.* TO ...}.

In order to accommodate granting rights to users from arbitrary hosts,
MySQL supports specifying the @code{user_name} value in the form
@code{user@@host}.  If you want to specify a @code{user} string
containing special characters (such as @samp{-}), or a @code{host} string
containing special characters or wildcard characters (such as @samp{%}), you
can quote the username or hostname (for example,
@code{'test-user'@@'test-hostname'}). Quote the username and hostname
separately.

You can specify wildcards in the hostname.  For example,
@code{user@@'%.loc.gov'} applies to @code{user} for any host in the
@code{loc.gov} domain, and @code{user@@'144.155.166.%'} applies to @code{user}
for any host in the @code{144.155.166} class C subnet.

The simple form @code{user} is a synonym for @code{user@@'%'}.

MySQL doesn't support wildcards in usernames.  Anonymous users are
defined by inserting entries with @code{User=''} into the
@code{mysql.user} table or creating a user with an empty name with the
@code{GRANT} statement:

@example
mysql> GRANT ALL ON test.* TO ''@@'localhost' ...
@end example

@strong{Note:} If you allow anonymous users to connect to the MySQL
server, you should also grant privileges to all local users as
@code{user@@localhost}. Otherwise, the anonymous user entry for
the local host in the @code{mysql.user} table will be used when users
try to log in to the MySQL server from the local machine!

You can determine whether this applies to you by executing the following query:

@example
mysql> SELECT Host, User FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
@end example

@c TODO: actually, Db, tbl_name, Column_name now are 64 characters...

For the moment, @code{GRANT} only supports host, table, database, and
column names up to 60 characters long. A username can be up to 16
characters.

The privileges for a table or column are formed additively from the
logical OR of the privileges at each of the four privilege
levels.  For example, if the @code{mysql.user} table specifies that a
user has a global @code{SELECT} privilege, the privilege cannot be denied by an
entry at the database, table, or column level.

The privileges for a column can be calculated as follows:

@example
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
@end example

In most cases, you grant rights to a user at only one of the privilege
levels, so life isn't normally this complicated. The details of the
privilege-checking procedure are presented in
@ref{Privilege system}.

If you grant privileges for a username/hostname combination that does not exist
in the @code{mysql.user} table, an entry is added and remains there until
deleted with a @code{DELETE} statement.  In other words, @code{GRANT} may
create @code{user} table entries, but @code{REVOKE} will not remove them;
you must do that explicitly using @code{DROP USER} or @code{DELETE}.

@cindex passwords, setting
In MySQL 3.22.12 or later,
if a new user is created or if you have global grant privileges, the user's
password will be set to the password specified by the @code{IDENTIFIED BY}
clause, if one is given.  If the user already had a password, it is replaced
by the new one.

@strong{Warning:} If you create a new user but do not specify an
@code{IDENTIFIED BY} clause, the user has no password.  This is insecure.

Passwords can also be set with the @code{SET PASSWORD} statement.
@xref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET}}.

If you don't want to send the password in clear text, you can use the
@code{PASSWORD} option followed by a scrambled password from SQL
function @code{PASSWORD()} or the
@code{make_scrambled_password()} C API function.

If you grant privileges for a database, an entry in the @code{mysql.db}
table is created if needed. When all privileges for the database have been
removed with @code{REVOKE}, this entry is deleted.

If a user has no privileges for a table, the table is not displayed
when the user requests a list of tables (for example, with a @code{SHOW TABLES}
statement). The same is true for @code{SHOW DATABASES}.

The @code{WITH GRANT OPTION} clause gives the user the ability to give
to other users any privileges the user has at the specified privilege level.
You should be careful to whom you give the @code{GRANT OPTION} privilege,
because two users with different privileges may be able to join privileges!

You cannot grant another user a privilege you don't have yourself; the
@code{GRANT OPTION} privilege allows you to give away only those privileges
you possess.

Be aware that when you grant a user the @code{GRANT OPTION} privilege at a
particular privilege level, any privileges the user already possesses (or
is given in the future!) at that level are also grantable by that user.
Suppose that you grant a user the @code{INSERT} privilege on a database.  If
you then grant the @code{SELECT} privilege on the database and specify
@code{WITH GRANT OPTION}, the user can give away not only the @code{SELECT}
privilege, but also @code{INSERT}.  If you then grant the @code{UPDATE}
privilege to the user on the database, the user can give away the
@code{INSERT}, @code{SELECT} and @code{UPDATE}.

You should not grant @code{ALTER} privileges to a normal user.  If you
do that, the user can try to subvert the privilege system by renaming
tables!

The
@code{MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR #}, @code{MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR #}, and
@code{MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR #} options are new in MySQL 4.0.2.
They limit the number of queries, updates, and logins a user can
do during one hour. If @code{#} is 0 (default), then this means that there
are no limitations for that user. @xref{User resources}.
Note: To specify any of these options for an existing user without affecting
existing privileges, use @code{GRANT USAGE ON *.* ... WITH MAX_...}.

The @code{REQUIRE} clause can be use to set up requirements related to the
use of secure connections.
For a description of how to use @code{REQUIRE}, see @ref{Secure connections}.

Note that if you are using table or column privileges for even one user, the
server examines table and column privileges for all users and this will slow
down MySQL a bit.
Similarly, if you limit the number of queries, updates, or connections for
any users, the server must monitor these values.

When @code{mysqld} starts, all privileges are read into memory.
Database, table, and column privileges take effect at once, and
user-level privileges take effect the next time the user connects.
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using @code{GRANT} or
@code{REVOKE} are noticed by the server immediately.
If you modify the grant tables manually (using @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE},
and so on), you should execute a @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} statement or run
@code{mysqladmin flush-privileges} to tell the server to reload the grant
tables.
@xref{Privilege changes}.

@cindex Standard SQL, differences from
The biggest differences between the standard SQL and MySQL versions of
@code{GRANT} are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In MySQL, privileges are given for a username/hostname combination
and not only for a username.

@item
Standard SQL doesn't have global or database-level privileges, nor does it 
support all the privilege types that MySQL supports.

@item
MySQL doesn't support the standard SQL @code{TRIGGER} or @code{UNDER}
privileges.

@item
Standard SQL privileges are structured in a hierarchical manner. If you remove
a user, all privileges the user has been granted are revoked. In
MySQL, the granted privileges are not automatically revoked;
you must revoke them yourself.

@item
In MySQL, if you have the @code{INSERT} privilege on only some of the
columns in a table, you can execute @code{INSERT} statements on the
table; the columns for which you don't have the @code{INSERT} privilege
will be set to their default values. standard SQL requires you to have the
@code{INSERT} privilege on all columns.

@item
With standard SQL, when you drop a table, all privileges for the table are
revoked.  With standard SQL, when you revoke a privilege, all privileges
that were granted based on the privilege are also revoked. In MySQL,
privileges can be dropped only with explicit @code{REVOKE} statements or
by manipulating the MySQL grant tables.

@c help_category Administration
@c example_for_help_topic SET PASSWORD
@example
SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('some password')
SET PASSWORD FOR user = PASSWORD('some password')
@end example

The @code{SET PASSWORD} statement assigns a password to an existing
MySQL account.

The first syntax sets the password for the current user. Any client that has
connected to the server using a non-anonymous account can change the password
for that account.

The second syntax sets the password for a specific account on the current
server host. Only clients with access to the @code{mysql} database can do
this.  The @code{user} value should be given in @code{user_name@@host_name}
format, where @code{user_name} and @code{host_name} are exactly as they are
listed in the @code{User} and @code{Host} columns of the @code{mysql.user}
table entry.  For example, if you had an entry with @code{User} and
@code{Host} fields of @code{'bob'} and @code{'%.loc.gov'}, you would write the
statement like this:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@@'%.loc.gov' = PASSWORD('newpass');
@end example

That is equivalent to the following statements:

@example
mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpass')

Analyze and store the key distribution for the table.  During the
analysis, the table is locked with a read lock.  This works on
@code{MyISAM} and @code{BDB} tables. For @code{MyISAM} tables, this statement
is equivalent to using @code{myisamchk -a}.

MySQL uses the stored key distribution to decide the order in which
tables should be joined when you perform a join on something other than a
constant.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The statement returns a table with the following columns:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .60

@item @code{Table} @tab The table name
@item @code{Op} @tab Always @code{analyze}

You can check the stored key distribution with the @code{SHOW INDEX} statement.
@xref{Show database info}.

If the table hasn't changed since the last @code{ANALYZE TABLE} statement,
the table will not be analyzed again.

Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{ANALYZE} statements are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1, they are written to the binary
log unless the optional @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG} keyword

@strong{Note:} This statement is deprecated. We are working on a better

In the meantime, the @code{mysqlhotcopy} script can be used instead.

@code{BACKUP TABLE} copies to the backup directory the minimum number of
table files needed to restore the table, after flushing any buffered changes
to disk. The statement works only for @code{MyISAM} tables.  It copies the
@file{.frm} (definition)  and @file{.MYD} (data) files. The @file{.MYI}
(index) file can be rebuilt from those two files.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Before using this statement, please see @ref{Backup}.

During the backup, a read lock is held for each table, one at time,
as they are being backed up. If you want to back up several tables as
a snapshot (preventing any of them from being changed during the backup
operation), you must first issue a @code{LOCK TABLES} statement to obtain a read
lock for every table in the group.

The statement returns a table with the following columns:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .60
@item @strong{Column} @tab @strong{Value}
@item @code{Table} @tab The table name
@item @code{Op} @tab Always @code{backup}

@c description_for_help_topic CHECK  TABLE QUICK FAST MEDIUM EXTENDED CHANGED
@code{CHECK TABLE} works only on @code{MyISAM} and @code{InnoDB} tables. On
@code{MyISAM} tables, This is the same thing as running @code{myisamchk
--medium-check tbl_name} on the table.

If you don't specify any option, @code{MEDIUM} is used.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Checks the table or tables for errors. For @code{MyISAM} tables, the key statistics
are updated. The statement returns a table with the following columns:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .60
@item @strong{Column} @tab @strong{Value}
@item @code{Table}    @tab The table name
@item @code{Op}       @tab Always @code{check}
@item @code{Msg_type} @tab One of @code{status}, @code{error}, @code{info}, or @code{warning}
@item @code{Msg_text} @tab The message
@end multitable

Note that the statement might produce many rows of information for each checked table.
The last row will be of @code{Msg_type status} and should normally be
@code{OK}.
If you don't get @code{OK}, or @code{Table is already up to
date} you should normally run a repair of the table. @xref{Table
maintenance}. @code{Table is already up to date} means that the storage
engine for the table indicated that there was no need to check the table.

The different check types are as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .85
@item @strong{Type} @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{QUICK} @tab Don't scan the rows to check for incorrect links.
@item @code{FAST}  @tab Only check tables that haven't been closed properly.
@item @code{CHANGED} @tab Only check tables that have been changed since the last check or haven't been closed properly.
@item @code{MEDIUM} @tab Scan rows to verify that deleted links are okay. This also calculates a key checksum for the rows and verifies this with a calculated checksum for the keys.
@item @code{EXTENDED} @tab Do a full key lookup for all keys for each row.  This ensures that the table is 100% consistent, but will take a long time!
@end multitable

If none of the options @code{QUICK}, @code{MEDIUM}, or @code{EXTENDED}
are specified, the default check type for dynamic-format @code{MyISAM}
tables is @code{MEDIUM}.  The default check type also is @code{MEDIUM} for
static-format @code{MyISAM} tables, unless @code{CHANGED} or @code{FAST}
is specified.  In that case, the default is @code{QUICK}. The row scan
is skipped for @code{CHANGED} and @code{FAST} because the rows are very
seldom corrupted.

You can combine check options, as in the following example, which does
a quick check on the table to see whether it was
closed properly:

@example
CHECK TABLE test_table FAST QUICK;
@end example

@strong{Note:} In some cases, @code{CHECK TABLE} will change the
table!  This happens if the table is marked as ``corrupted'' or ``not
closed properly'' but @code{CHECK TABLE} doesn't find any problems in the
table.  In this case, @code{CHECK TABLE} marks the table as okay.

If a table is corrupted, it's most likely that the problem is in
the indexes and not in the data part.  All of the preceding check types
check the indexes thoroughly and should thus find most errors.

If you just want to check a table that you assume is okay, you should use
no check options or the @code{QUICK} option. The latter should be used
when you are in a hurry and can take the very small risk that
@code{QUICK} doesn't find an error in the data file. (In most cases,
MySQL should find, under normal usage, any error in the data file.
If this happens, the table is marked as ``corrupted'' and cannot
be used until it's repaired.)

@code{FAST} and @code{CHANGED} are mostly intended to be used from a
script (for example, to be executed from @code{cron}) if you want to check your
table from time to time. In most cases, @code{FAST} is to be preferred
over @code{CHANGED}.  (The only case when it isn't preferred is when you suspect
that you have found a bug in the @code{MyISAM} code.)

@code{EXTENDED} is to be used only after you have run a normal check but
still get strange errors from a table when MySQL tries to
update a row or find a row by key. (This is very unlikely if a
normal check has succeeded!)

Some problems reported by @code{CHECK TABLE} can't be corrected automatically:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{Found row where the auto_increment column has the value 0}.

This means that you have a row in the table where the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} index column contains the value 0.
(It's possible to create a row where the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column is 0 by
explicitly setting the column to 0 with an @code{UPDATE} statement.)

This isn't an error in itself, but could cause trouble if you decide to
dump the table and restore it or do an @code{ALTER TABLE} on the
table. In this case, the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column will change value
according to the rules of @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns, which could cause
problems such as a duplicate-key error.

To get rid of the warning, just execute an @code{UPDATE} statement
to set the column to some other value than 0.

Reports a table checksum.

If @code{QUICK} is specified, the live table checksum is reported if it is

@xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

In @code{EXTENDED} mode the whole table is read row by row and the checksum
is calculated. This can be very slow for large tables.

table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows
(tables that have @code{VARCHAR}, @code{BLOB}, or @code{TEXT} columns).
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent @code{INSERT}
operations reuse old record positions. You can use @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the data file.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

In most setups, you need not run @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} at all.  Even
if you do a lot of updates to variable-length rows, it's not likely that
you need to do this more than once a week or month and only on certain
tables.

For the moment, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} works only on @code{MyISAM} and
@code{BDB} tables. For @code{BDB} tables, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} is
currently mapped to @code{ANALYZE TABLE}.
@xref{ANALYZE TABLE, , @code{ANALYZE TABLE}}.

You can get @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} to work on other table types by starting
@code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-new} or @code{--safe-mode} option,
but in this case, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} is just mapped to @code{ALTER TABLE}.

@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} works as follows:
@enumerate
@item
If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
@item
If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
@item
If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be done
by sorting the index), update them.
@end enumerate

Note that MySQL locks the table during the time @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} is
running!

Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{OPTIMIZE} statements are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1, they are written to the binary
log unless the optional @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG} keyword 
(or its alias @code{LOCAL}) is used.

@subsubsection @code{REPAIR TABLE} Syntax

@findex REPAIR TABLE

@c example_for_help_topic REPAIR
@example

@end example

@c description_for_help_topic REPAIR  USE_FRM TABLE QUICK EXTENDED NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG LOCAL
@code{REPAIR TABLE} repairs a possibly corrupted table.
By default,
it has the same effect as @code{myisamchk --recover tbl_name} on a table.
@code{REPAIR TABLE} works only on @code{MyISAM} tables.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Normally you should never have to run this statement. However, if disaster
strikes, @code{REPAIR TABLE} is very likely to get back all your data from
a @code{MyISAM} table.  If your tables get corrupted often, you should try
to find the reason for it, to eliminate the need to use @code{REPAIR TABLE}.
@xref{Crashing}.  @xref{MyISAM table problems,  , @code{MyISAM} table problems}.

The statement returns a table with the following columns:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .60
@item @strong{Column} @tab @strong{Value}
@item @code{Table} @tab The table name
@item @code{Op} @tab Always @code{repair}
@item @code{Msg_type} @tab One of @code{status}, @code{error}, @code{info}, or @code{warning}
@item @code{Msg_text} @tab The message
@end multitable

The @code{REPAIR TABLE} statement might produce many rows of information
for each repaired table.  The last one row will have a @code{Msg_type}
or @code{status} and @code{Msg_test} should normally be @code{OK}.  If you
don't get @code{OK}, you should try repairing the table with @code{myisamchk
--safe-recover}, because @code{REPAIR TABLE} does not yet implement all the
options of @code{myisamchk}. We plan to make it more flexible in the future.

If @code{QUICK} is given, @code{REPAIR TABLE} tries to repair
only the index tree.  This type of repair is like that done by
@code{myisamchk --recover --quick}.

If you use @code{EXTENDED}, MySQL creates the index row by row instead of
creating one index at a time with sorting.  (Before MySQL 4.1, this might
be better than sorting on fixed-length keys if you have long @code{CHAR}
keys that compress very well.)  This type of repair is like that done by
@code{myisamchk --safe-recover}.

As of MySQL 4.0.2, there is a @code{USE_FRM} mode for @code{REPAIR}.  Use it
if the @file{.MYI} file is missing or if its header is corrupted.  In this
mode, MySQL will re-create the @file{.MYI} file using information from the
@file{.frm} file. This kind of repair cannot be done with @code{myisamchk}.

@strong{Warning:} If the server dies during a @code{REPAIR TABLE} operation,
it's essential that after restarting it you immediately execute another
@code{REPAIR TABLE} for the table before performing any other operations on
it. (It's always good to start by making a backup.)  In the worst case, you
might have a new clean index file without information about the data file,
and then the next operation you perform could overwrite the data file.
This is an unlikely, but possible scenario.

Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{REPAIR} statements are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1, they are written to the binary
log unless the optional @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG} keyword 
(or its alias @code{LOCAL}) is used.

@findex RESTORE TABLE

@c description_for_help_topic RESTORE  TABLE

@example
RESTORE TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... FROM '/path/to/backup/directory'
@end example

Restores the table or tables from a backup that was made with @code{BACKUP
TABLE}. Existing tables will not be overwritten; if you try to restore over
an existing table, you will get an error.  Just as @code{BACKUP TABLE},
@code{RESTORE TABLE} currently works only for @code{MyISAM} tables.

The backup for each table consists of its @file{.frm} format file and
@file{.MYD} data file. The restore operation restores those files, and then
uses them to rebuild the @file{.MYI} index file.  Restoring takes longer
than backing up due to the need to rebuild the index. The more indexes the
table has, the longer it will take.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{SHOW} has many forms that provide information about databases,
tables, columns, or status information about the server.
This section describes those following:

@c example_for_help_topic SHOW

    | @@@@[global. | session.]system_var_name = expression
@end example

@c description_for_help_topic SET  GLOBAL SESSION VARIABLE
@code{SET} sets different types of variables that affect the operation of the
server or your client. It can be used to assign values to user variables or
system variables.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

In MySQL 4.0.3, we added the @code{GLOBAL} and @code{SESSION} options
and allowed most important system variables to be changed dynamically at
runtime.
The system variables that you can set at runtime are described in
@ref{Dynamic System Variables}.

In older versions of MySQL, we allowed the use of the @code{SET OPTION} syntax,
but this is now deprecated; just leave out the word @code{OPTION}.

The following examples shows the different syntaxes you can use to set
variables.

A user variable is written as @code{@@var_name} and can be set as follows:

@example
SET @@var_name = expression;
@end example

Further information about user variables is given in @ref{Variables}.

System variables can be referred to in @code{SET} statements as
@code{var_name}. The name optionally can be preceded by @code{GLOBAL} or
@code{@@@@global.} to indicate explicitly that the variable is a global
variable, or by @code{SESSION}, @code{@@@@session.}, or @code{@@@@} to
indicate that it is a session variable.  @code{LOCAL} and @code{@@@@local.}
are synonyms for @code{SESSION} and @code{@@@@session.}. If no modifier is
present, @code{SET} sets the session variable.

The @code{@@@@var_name} syntax is supported to make MySQL syntax
compatible with some other databases.

If you set several system variables in the same statement, the last used
@code{GLOBAL} or @code{SESSION} option is used for variables that have no mode
specified.

@example
SET sort_buffer_size=10000;
SET @@@@local.sort_buffer_size=10000;
SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size=1000000, SESSION sort_buffer_size=1000000;
SET @@@@sort_buffer_size=1000000;
SET @@@@global.sort_buffer_size=1000000, @@@@local.sort_buffer_size=1000000;
@end example

If you set a variable using @code{SESSION} (the default), the value remains
in effect until the current session ends or until you set the variable to
a different value. If you set a variable using @code{GLOBAL}, which requires the
@code{SUPER} privilege, the value is remembered and used for new
connections until the server restarts. If you want to make a variable
setting permanent, you should put it in an option file.
@xref{Option files}.

To prevent incorrect usage, MySQL produces an error if you use @code{SET
GLOBAL} with a variable that can only be used with @code{SET SESSION} or if
you do not specify @code{GLOBAL} when setting a global variable.

If you want to set a @code{SESSION} variable to the @code{GLOBAL} value or a
@code{GLOBAL} value to the compiled-in MySQL default value, you can set it to
@code{DEFAULT}. For example, the following two statements are identical in
setting the session value of @code{max_join_size} to the global value:

@example
SET max_join_size=DEFAULT;
SET @@@@session.max_join_size=@@@@global.max_join_size;
@end example

You can get a list of most variables with @code{SHOW VARIABLES}.
@xref{SHOW VARIABLES,  , @code{SHOW VARIABLES}}.
To get a specific variable name or list of names that match a pattern, use a
@code{LIKE} clause:

@example
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'max_join_size';
@end example

You can also get the value for a specific value by using the
@code{@@@@[global.|local.]variable_name} syntax with @code{SELECT}:

@example
SELECT @@@@max_join_size, @@@@global.max_join_size;
@end example

When you retrieve a variable with @code{SELECT @@@@var_name} (that is, you
do not specify @code{global.}, @code{session.}, or @code{local.}), MySQL returns
the @code{SESSION} value if it exists and the @code{GLOBAL} value otherwise.

The following list describes variables that have non-standard syntax or that are
not described in the list of system variables that is found in
@ref{Server system variables}.
Although these variables are not displayed by @code{SHOW VARIABLES}, you can
obtain their values with @code{SELECT} (with the exception of @code{CHARACTER
SET}). For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT @@@@AUTOCOMMIT;
+--------------+
| @@@@autocommit |
+--------------+
|            1 |
+--------------+
@end example

@c TODO: Move this list to server config chapter?

@table @code

@item AUTOCOMMIT = @{0 | 1@}
Set the autocommit mode.
If set to @code{1}, all changes to a table take effect immediately.
If set to @code{0}, you have to use @code{COMMIT} to accept a transaction or
@code{ROLLBACK} to cancel it.  Note that when you change @code{AUTOCOMMIT}
mode from @code{0} to @code{1}, MySQL performs an automatic @code{COMMIT}
of any open transaction.  Another way to begin a transaction is to use a
@code{START TRANSACTION} or @code{BEGIN} statement.
@xref{COMMIT,  , @code{COMMIT}}.

@item BIG_TABLES = @{0 | 1@}
@cindex table is full
If set to @code{1}, all temporary tables are stored on disk rather than in
memory.  This is a little slower, but the error @code{The table tbl_name is
full} will not occur for @code{SELECT} operations that require a large
temporary table.  The default value for a new connection is
@code{0} (use in-memory temporary tables).  As of MySQL 4.0, you
should normally never need to set this variable, because MySQL automatically
converts in-memory tables to disk-based tables as necessary.  This variable
previously was named @code{SQL_BIG_TABLES}.

@c TODO: discuss optional collation

@item CHARACTER SET @{character_set_name | DEFAULT@}
This maps all strings from and to the client with the given mapping.
Before MySQL 4.1, the only allowable value for @code{character_set_name}
is @code{cp1251_koi8}, but you can add new mappings by editing the
@file{sql/convert.cc} file in the MySQL source distribution.  As of MySQL
4.1.1, @code{SET CHARACTER SET} sets three session system variables:
@code{character_set_client} and @code{character_set_results} are set to
the given character set, and @code{character_set_connection} to the value
of @code{character_set_database}.

The default mapping can be restored by using a value of @code{DEFAULT}.

Note that the syntax for @code{SET CHARACTER SET} differs
from that for setting most other options.

@c THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED
@c @item DATE_FORMAT = format_str
@c Determines how the server converts @code{DATE} values to strings. This
@c variable is available as a global, local, or command-line
@c option. @code{format_str} can be specified conveniently using the
@c @code{GET_FORMAT()} function.
@c @xref{Date and time functions}.

@c @code{GET_FORMAT()} function.
@c @xref{Date and time functions}.

@item FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1} (the default), foreign key constraints for @code{InnoDB}
tables are checked.  If set to @code{0}, they are ignored.  Disabling foreign
key checking can be useful for reloading @code{InnoDB} tables in an order
different than that required by their parent/child relationships.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.52.
@xref{InnoDB foreign key constraints,  , @code{InnoDB} foreign key constraints}.

@item IDENTITY = #
The variable is a synonym for the @code{LAST_INSERT_ID} variable.
It exists for compatibility with other databases.
As of MySQL 3.23.25, you can read its value with @code{SELECT @@@@IDENTITY}.
As of MySQL 4.0.3, you can also set its value with @code{SET IDENTITY}.

@item INSERT_ID = #
Set the value to be used by the following @code{INSERT} or @code{ALTER TABLE}
statement when inserting an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value.  This is mainly used
with the binary log.

@item LAST_INSERT_ID = #
Set the value to be returned from @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}. This is stored in
the binary log when you use @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} in a statement that updates
a table. Setting this variable does not update @code{mysql_insert_id()}.

@c TODO: discuss optional collation

@item NAMES @{'character_set_name' | DEFAULT@}
@code{SET NAMES} sets the three session system variables
@code{character_set_client}, @code{character_set_connection}, and
@code{character_set_results} to the given character set.

The default mapping can be restored by using a value of @code{DEFAULT}.

Note that the syntax for @code{SET NAMES} differs
from that for setting most other options.
This statement is available as of MySQL 4.1.0.

@item SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1} (the default), you can find the last inserted row for a table
that contains an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column by using the following construct:

@example
WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL
@end example

This behavior is used by some ODBC programs, such as Access.
@code{SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL} was added in MySQL 3.23.52.

@item SQL_BIG_SELECTS = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{0}, MySQL aborts @code{SELECT} statements
that probably will take a very long time (that is, statements for which
the optimizer estimates that the number of of examined rows will
exceed the value of @code{max_join_size}).
This is useful when an inadvisable @code{WHERE} statement has been
issued.  The default value for a new connection is @code{1}, which allows
all @code{SELECT} statements.

If you set the @code{max_join_size} system variable to a value other than
@code{DEFAULT}, @code{SQL_BIG_SELECTS} will be set to @code{0}.

@item SQL_BUFFER_RESULT = @{0 | 1@}
@code{SQL_BUFFER_RESULT} forces results from @code{SELECT} statements
to be put into temporary tables. This helps MySQL free the
table locks early and can be beneficial in cases where it takes a long time to
send results to the client.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.13.

@item SQL_LOG_BIN = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{0}, no logging is done to the binary log for the client.
The client must have the @code{SUPER} privilege to set this option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.16.

@item SQL_LOG_OFF = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1}, no logging is done to the general query log for this
client.  The client must have the @code{SUPER} privilege to set this option.

@item SQL_LOG_UPDATE = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{0}, no logging is done to the update log for the client.
The client must have the @code{SUPER} privilege to set this option.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.5.
Starting from MySQL 5.0.0, it is deprecated and is mapped to
@code{SQL_LOG_BIN} (@pxref{News-5.0.0}).

@item SQL_QUOTE_SHOW_CREATE = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1}, @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} quotes table and column
names. If set to @code{0}, quoting is disabled.  This option is enabled
by default so that replication will work for tables with table and column
names that require quoting.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.26.
@ref{SHOW CREATE TABLE, , @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}}.

@item SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1}, MySQL aborts @code{UPDATE} or @code{DELETE} statements
that do not use a key in the @code{WHERE} clause or a @code{LIMIT} clause.
This makes it possible to catch @code{UPDATE} or @code{DELETE} statements
where keys are not used properly and that would probably change or delete a
large number of rows.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.32.

@item SQL_SELECT_LIMIT = @{value | DEFAULT@}
The maximum number of records to return from @code{SELECT} statements.  The
default value for a new connection is ``unlimited.'' If you have changed the
limit, the default value can be restored by using a @code{SQL_SELECT_LIMIT}
value of @code{DEFAULT}.

If a @code{SELECT} has a @code{LIMIT} clause, the @code{LIMIT} takes
precedence over the value of @code{SQL_SELECT_LIMIT}.

@item SQL_WARNINGS = @{0 | 1@}
This variable controls whether single-row @code{INSERT} statements produce
an information string if warnings occur.  The default is 0.  Set the value
to 1 to produce an information string.
This variable was added in MySQL 3.22.11.

@item TIMESTAMP = @{timestamp_value | DEFAULT@}
Set the time for this client.  This is used to get the original timestamp if
you use the binary log to restore rows.  @code{timestamp_value} should be a
Unix epoch timestamp, not a MySQL timestamp.

@c THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED
@c @item TIME_FORMAT = format_str
@c Determines how the server converts @code{TIME} values to strings. This
@c variable is available as a global, local, or command-line
@c option. @code{format_str} can be specified conveniently using the
@c @code{GET_FORMAT()} function.
@c @xref{Date and time functions}.

@item UNIQUE_CHECKS = @{0 | 1@}
If set to @code{1} (the default), uniqueness checks for secondary indexes in
@code{InnoDB} tables are performed.  If set to @code{0}, no uniqueness
checks are done.  This variable was added in MySQL 3.23.52.

@end example

@code{SHOW COLUMNS} lists the columns in a given table.  If the column types
differ from what you expect them to be based on your @code{CREATE TABLE}
statement, note that MySQL sometimes changes column types when you create or
alter a table.  The conditions for which this occurs are described in
@ref{Silent column changes}.

The @code{FULL} keyword can be used from MySQL 3.23.32 on. It causes the the
output to include the privileges you have for each column.  As of MySQL 4.1,
@code{FULL} also causes any per-column comments to be displayed.

You can use @code{db_name.tbl_name} as an alternative to the @code{tbl_name
FROM db_name} syntax.  These two statements are equivalent:

@example
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable FROM mydb;
mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM mydb.mytable;
@end example

@code{SHOW FIELDS} is a synonym for @code{SHOW COLUMNS}.  You can also
list a table's columns with the @code{mysqlshow db_name tbl_name} command.

The @code{DESCRIBE} statement provides information similar to
@code{SHOW COLUMNS}.

@code{SHOW INDEX} returns table index information in a format that closely
resembles the @code{SQLStatistics} call in ODBC.

@code{SHOW INDEX} returns the following fields:

@multitable @columnfractions .20 .80
@item @strong{Column}            @tab @strong{Meaning}
@item @code{Table}               @tab The name of the table.

@item @code{Key_name}            @tab The name of the index.
@item @code{Seq_in_index}        @tab The column sequence number in the index,
                                      starting with 1.
@item @code{Column_name}         @tab The column name.
@item @code{Collation}           @tab How the column is sorted in the index.
                                      In MySQL, this can have values
                                      @samp{A} (Ascending) or @code{NULL} (Not
                                      sorted).
@item @code{Cardinality}         @tab The number of unique values in the index.
                                      This is updated by running @code{ANALYZE
                                      TABLE} or @code{myisamchk -a}.
                                      @code{Cardinality} is counted based on
                                      statistics stored as integers, so it's
                                      not necessarily accurate for small tables.
@item @code{Sub_part}            @tab The number of indexed characters if the
                                      column is only partly indexed.
                                      @code{NULL} if the entire column is indexed.
@item @code{Packed}              @tab Indicates how the key is packed.  @code{NULL} if it is not.
@item @code{Null}                @tab Contains @code{YES} if the column may contain @code{NULL}.
@item @code{Index_type}          @tab The index method used (@code{BTREE},
@code{FULLTEXT}, @code{HASH}), @code{RTREE}).
@item @code{Comment}             @tab Various remarks.  Before MySQL 4.0.2 when the @code{Index_type} column was added, @code{Comment} indicates whether an index is @code{FULLTEXT}.
@end multitable

The @code{Packed} and @code{Comments} columns were added in MySQL 3.23.0.
The @code{Null} and @code{Index_type} columns were added in MySQL 4.0.2.

You can use @code{db_name.tbl_name} as an alternative to the @code{tbl_name

@example
SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST
@end example

@code{SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST} shows you which threads are running.
You can also get this information using the @code{mysqladmin processlist}
statement.  If you have the @code{SUPER} privilege, you can see all
threads.  Otherwise, you can see only your own threads.
@xref{KILL, ,@code{KILL}}.
If you don't use the @code{FULL} option, only the first 100
characters of each query are shown.

Starting from MySQL 4.0.12, the statement reports the hostname for TCP/IP
connections in @code{host_name:client_port} format to make it easier to
determine which client is doing what.

This statement is very useful if you get the 'too many connections' error
message and want to find out what's going on. MySQL reserves
one extra connection for a client with the @code{SUPER} privilege
to ensure that you should always be able to log in and check the system
(assuming that you are not giving this privilege to all your users).

Some states commonly seen in the output from @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}:

@table @code

@item Checking table
The thread is performing (automatic) checking of the table.

@item Closing tables
Means that the thread is flushing the changed table data to disk and
closing the used tables. This should be a fast operation.  If not, then
you should verify that you don't have a full disk and that the disk is not
in very heavy use.

@item Connect Out
Slave connecting to master.

@item Copying to tmp table on disk
The temporary result set was larger than @code{tmp_table_size} and the
thread is now changing the in temporary table from in-memory to disk-based
format to save memory.

@item Creating tmp table
The thread is creating a temporary table to hold a part of the result for
the query.

@item deleting from main table
The server is executing the first part of a multiple-table delete and
deleting only from the first table.

@item deleting from reference tables
The server is executing the second part of a multiple-table delete and deleting
the matched rows from the other tables.

@item Flushing tables
The thread is executing @code{FLUSH TABLES} and is waiting for all
threads to close their tables.

@item Killed
Someone has sent a kill to the thread and it should abort next time it
checks the kill flag.  The flag is checked in each major loop in MySQL,
but in some cases it might still take a short time for the thread to die.
If the thread is locked by some other thread, the kill will take effect
as soon as the other thread releases its lock.

@item Sending data
The thread is processing rows for a @code{SELECT} statement and is
also sending data to the client.

@item Sorting for group
The thread is doing a sort to satisfy a @code{GROUP BY}.

@item Sorting for order
The thread is doing a sort to satisfy a @code{ORDER BY}.

@item Opening tables
This simply means that the thread is trying to open a table. This is
should be very fast procedure, unless something prevents opening. For
example, an @code{ALTER TABLE} or a @code{LOCK TABLE} can prevent opening
a table until the statement is finished.

@item Removing duplicates
The query was using @code{SELECT DISTINCT} in such a way that MySQL
couldn't optimize away the distinct operation at an early stage. Because of
this, MySQL requires an extra stage to remove all duplicated rows before
sending the result to the client.

@item Reopen table
The thread got a lock for the table, but noticed after getting the lock
that the underlying table structure changed. It has freed the lock,
closed the table, and is now trying to reopen it.

@item Repair by sorting
The repair code is using sorting to create indexes.

@item Repair with keycache
The repair code is using creating keys one by one through the key cache.
This is much slower than @code{Repair by sorting}.

@item Searching rows for update
The thread is doing a first phase to find all matching rows before
updating them.  This has to be done if the @code{UPDATE} is changing
the index that is used to find the involved rows.

@item Sleeping
The thread is waiting for the client to send a new statement to it.

@item System lock
The thread is waiting to get a external system lock for the
table. If you are not using multiple @code{mysqld} servers that are accessing
the same tables, you can disable system locks with the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option.

@item Upgrading lock
The @code{INSERT DELAYED} handler is trying to get a lock for the table
to insert rows.

@item Updating
The thread is searching for rows to update and updating them.

@item User Lock
The thread is waiting on a @code{GET_LOCK()}.

@item Waiting for tables
The thread got a notification that the underlying structure for a table
has changed and it needs to reopen the table to get the new structure.
However, to be able to reopen the table, it must wait until all other
threads have closed the table in question.

This notification happens if another thread has used @code{FLUSH TABLES}
or one of the following statements on the table in question: @code{FLUSH
TABLES tbl_name}, @code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{RENAME TABLE},
@code{REPAIR TABLE}, @code{ANALYZE TABLE}, or @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}.

@item waiting for handler insert
The @code{INSERT DELAYED} handler has processed all pending inserts and is
waiting for new ones.

@end table

Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a thread stays in any
of these states for many seconds, there might be a problem around that
needs to be investigated.

There are some other states that are not mentioned in the preceding list,
but most of them are useful only for finding bugs in the server.

also get this list using the @code{mysqlshow --status db_name} command.

@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} returns the following fields:

@table @code

@item Name
The name of the table.

@item Type
The type of the table. @xref{Table types}.

@item Row_format
The row storage format (@code{Fixed}, @code{Dynamic}, or @code{Compressed}).

@item Rows
The number of rows.

@item Avg_row_length
The average row length.

@item Data_length
The length of the data file.

@item Max_data_length
The maximum length of the data file.
For fixed-row formats, this is the maximum number of rows in the table.
For dynamic-row formats, this is the total number of data bytes that
can be stored in the table, given the data pointer size used.

@item Index_length
The length of the index file.

@item Data_free
The number of allocated but not used bytes.

@item Auto_increment
The next @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value.

@item Create_time
When the table was created.

@item Update_time
When the data file was last updated.

@item Check_time
When the table was last checked.

@item Collation
The table's character set and collation. (New in 4.1.1)

@item Checksum
The live checksum value (if any). (New in 4.1.1)

@item Create_options
Extra options used with @code{CREATE TABLE}.

@item Comment
The comment used when creating the table (or some information why MySQL
couldn't access the table information).

@end table

In the table comment, @code{InnoDB} tables will report the free space of
the tablespace to which the table belongs.  For a table located in the
shared tablespace, this is the free space of the shared tablespace. If
you are using multiple tablespaces and the table has its own tablespace,
the freespace is for just that table.

For @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables, the @code{Data_length},
@code{Max_data_length}, and @code{Index_length} values approximate the
actual amount of allocated memory. The allocation algorithm reserves memory
in large amounts to reduce the number of allocation operations.

@end example

@cindex @code{mysqladmin}
@code{SHOW VARIABLES} shows the values of some MySQL system variables.  This
information also can be obtained using the @code{mysqladmin variables}
command.

The @code{GLOBAL} and @code{SESSION} options are new in MySQL 4.0.3.
With @code{GLOBAL}, you will get the values that will be used for new
connections to MySQL. With @code{SESSION}, you will get the values that
are in effect for the current connection. If you use neither option, the
default @code{SESSION}. @code{LOCAL} is a synonym for @code{SESSION}.

If the default values are unsuitable, you can set most of these variables
using command-line options when @code{mysqld} starts or at runtime with
the @code{SET} statement.
See @ref{Server options} and @ref{SET OPTION, , @code{SET}}.

Partial output is shown here. The list of variables and their values may be
different for your server. The meaning of each variable is given in
@xref{Server system variables}.
Information about tuning them is provided in @ref{Server parameters}.

@node SHOW WARNINGS,  , SHOW VARIABLES, SHOW
@subsubsection @code{SHOW WARNINGS} Syntax

@findex SHOW WARNINGS

@example
SHOW WARNINGS [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
@end example


@code{SHOW WARNINGS} shows the error, warning, and note messages that
resulted from the last statement that generated messages, or nothing if the
last statement that used a table generated no messages.
This statement is implemented as of MySQL 4.1.0.
A related statement, @code{SHOW ERRORS}, shows only the errors.
@xref{SHOW ERRORS,  , @code{SHOW ERRORS}}.

The list of messages is reset for each new statement that uses a table.

You can retrieve the total number of errors, warnings, and notes
from the @code{warning_count} variable:

@example
SELECT @@@@warning_count;
@end example

The value of @code{warning_count} might be greater than the number of
messages displayed by @code{SHOW WARNINGS} if the @code{max_error_count}
system variable is set low enough that not all messages are stored. An
example shown later in this section demonstrates how this can happen.

The @code{LIMIT} clause has the same syntax as for the @code{SELECT}
statement.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.

The MySQL server sends back the total number of errors, warnings, and
notes resulting from the last statement.
If you are using the C API, this value can be obtained by calling
@code{mysql_warning_count()}.
@xref{mysql_warning_count,  , @code{mysql_warning_count()}}.

Note that the framework for warnings was added in MySQL 4.1.0, at which
point many statements did not generate warnings.  In 4.1.1, the situation is
much improved, with warnings generated for statements such as @code{LOAD
DATA INFILE} and DML statements such as @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE},
@code{CREATE TABLE}, and @code{ALTER TABLE}.

The following @code{DROP TABLE} statement results in a note:

@example
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS no_such_table;
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+-------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                       |
+-------+------+-------------------------------+
| Note  | 1051 | Unknown table 'no_such_table' |
+-------+------+-------------------------------+
@end example

Here is a simple example that shows a syntax warning for @code{CREATE TABLE}
and conversion warnings for @code{INSERT}:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a TINYINT NOT NULL, b CHAR(4)) TYPE=MyISAM;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1287
Message: 'TYPE=storage_engine' is deprecated, use
         'ENGINE=storage_engine' instead
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(10,'mysql'),(NULL,'test'),
    -> (300,'open source');
Query OK, 3 rows affected, 4 warnings (0.01 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 4

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1265
Message: Data truncated for column 'b' at row 1
*************************** 2. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1263
Message: Data truncated, NULL supplied to NOT NULL column 'a' at row 2
*************************** 3. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1264
Message: Data truncated, out of range for column 'a' at row 3
*************************** 4. row ***************************
  Level: Warning
   Code: 1265
Message: Data truncated for column 'b' at row 3
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

The maximum number of error, warning, and note messages to store is controlled
by the @code{max_error_count} system variable.  By default, its value is 64.
To change the number of messages you want stored, change the value of
@code{max_error_count}.
In the following example, the @code{ALTER TABLE} statement produces three
warning messages, but only one is stored because @code{max_error_count}
has been set to @code{1}:

@example
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_error_count';
+-----------------+-------+
| Variable_name   | Value |
+-----------------+-------+
| max_error_count | 64    |
+-----------------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SET max_error_count=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b CHAR;
Query OK, 3 rows affected, 3 warnings (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 3

mysql> SELECT @@@@warning_count;
+-----------------+
| @@@@warning_count |
+-----------------+
|               3 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+----------------------------------------+
| Level   | Code | Message                                |
+---------+------+----------------------------------------+
| Warning | 1263 | Data truncated for column 'b' at row 1 |
+---------+------+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

To disable warnings, set @code{max_error_count} to @code{0}. In this case,
@code{warning_count} still represents how many warnings have occurred, but
none of the messages are stored.

@end example

@c description_for_help_topic CACHE INDEX
The @code{CACHE INDEX} statement assigns table indexes to a specific key
cache. It is used only for @code{MyISAM} tables.

The following statement assigns indexes from the tables @code{t1},
@code{t2}, and @code{t3} to the key cache named @code{hot_cache}:

@example
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1, t2, t3 IN hot_cache;
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| Table   | Op                 | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
| test.t1 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t2 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
| test.t3 | assign_to_keycache | status   | OK       |
+---------+--------------------+----------+----------+
@end example
@c end_description_for_help_topic

The syntax of @code{CACHE INDEX} allows you to specify that only particular
indexes from a table should be assigned to the cache.  However, the current
implementation assigns all the table's indexes to the cache, so there is no
reason to specify anything other than the table name.

The key cache referred to in a @code{CACHE INDEX} statement can be created
by setting its size with a parameter setting statement or in the server
parameter settings. For example:

@example
mysql> SET GLOBAL keycache1.key_buffer_size=128*1024;
@end example

Key cache parameters can be accessed as members of a structured system
variable.
@xref{Structured System Variables}.

A key cache must exist before you can assign indexes to it:

@example
mysql> CACHE INDEX t1 in non_existent_cache;
ERROR 1283 (HY000): Unknown key cache 'non_existent_cache'
@end example

By default, table indexes are assigned to the main (default) key cache
created at the server startup. When a key cache is destroyed, all
indexes assigned to it become assigned to the default key cache again.

Index assignment affects the server globally: If one client
assigns an index to a given cache, this cache is used for all queries
involving the index, no matter what client issues the queries.

@code{CACHE INDEX} was added in MySQL 4.1.1.

You should use the @code{FLUSH} statement if you want to clear some of the
internal caches MySQL uses.  To execute @code{FLUSH}, you must have
the @code{RELOAD} privilege.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{flush_option} can be any of the following:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .75
@item @strong{Option} @tab @strong{Description}

@item @code{HOSTS}  @tab Empties the host cache tables.  You should flush the
host tables if some of your hosts change IP number or if you get the
error message @code{Host ... is blocked}.  When more than
@code{max_connect_errors} errors occur successively for a given host while
connecting to the MySQL server, MySQL assumes that
something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection requests.
Flushing the host tables allows the host to attempt to connect
again. @xref{Blocked host}. You can start @code{mysqld} with
@code{--max_connect_errors=999999999} to avoid this error message.

@item @code{DES_KEY_FILE} @tab Reloads the DES keys from the file that was
specified with the @code{--des-key-file} option at server startup time.

@item @code{LOGS} @tab Closes and reopens all log files.
If you have specified an update log file or a binary log file without
an extension, the extension number of the log file will be incremented
by one relative to the previous file. If you have used an extension in
the file name, MySQL will close and reopen the update log file.
@xref{Update log}. On Unix, this is the same thing as sending a @code{SIGHUP}
signal to the @code{mysqld} server.

@item @code{PRIVILEGES} @tab Reloads the privileges from the grant tables in
the @code{mysql} database.

@item @code{QUERY CACHE} @tab Defragment the query cache to better utilize its
memory.  This statement does not remove any queries from the cache, unlike
@code{RESET QUERY CACHE}.

@item @code{STATUS} @tab Resets most status variables to zero. This is something you should use only when debugging a query. @xref{Bug reports}.

@c TODO: non-TEMPORARY tables only?

@item @code{@{TABLE | TABLES@} [tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...]} @tab When no tables are named, closes all open tables and forces all tables in use to be closed. This also flushes the query cache.  With one or more table names, flushes only the given tables.
@code{FLUSH TABLES} also removes all query results from the query cache, like
the @code{RESET QUERY CACHE} statement.
statement

@item @code{TABLES WITH READ LOCK} @tab Closes all open tables and locks all
tables for all databases with a read lock until you execute @code{UNLOCK
TABLES}. This is very convenient way to get backups if you have a filesystem
such as Veritas that can take snapshots in time.

@item @code{USER_RESOURCES} @tab Resets all user resources to zero. This
enables clients that have reached their hourly connection, query, or update
limits to resume activity. @xref{User resources}.
@end multitable

Before MySQL 4.1.1, @code{FLUSH} statements are not written to the binary
log. Since MySQL 4.1.1, they are written to the binary log unless the
optional @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG} keyword (or its alias @code{LOCAL}) is
used.  Exceptions are that @code{FLUSH LOGS}, @code{FLUSH MASTER},
@code{FLUSH SLAVE}, and @code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} are not logged in
any case because they would cause problems if replicated to a slave.

You can also access some of these statements with the @code{mysqladmin}
utility, using the @code{flush-hosts}, @code{flush-logs}, @code{flush-privileges},
@code{flush-status}, or @code{flush-tables} commands.

@c description_for_help_topic KILL
Each connection to @code{mysqld} runs in a separate thread.  You can see
which threads are running with the @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} statement and kill
a thread with the @code{KILL thread_id} statement.

As of MySQL 5.0.0, @code{KILL} allows the optional @code{CONNECTION} or
@code{QUERY} modifiers:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{KILL CONNECTION} is the same as @code{KILL} with no modifier:
It terminates the connection associated with the given @code{thread_id}.

@item
@code{KILL QUERY} terminates the statement that the connection currently
is executing, but leaves the connection intact.

@end itemize

If you have the @code{PROCESS} privilege, you can see all threads.
If you have the @code{SUPER} privilege, you can kill all threads and
statements.  Otherwise, you can only see and kill your own threads and
statements.

You can also use the @code{mysqladmin processlist} and @code{mysqladmin kill}
commands to examine and kill threads.

@strong{Note:} You currently cannot use @code{KILL} with the Embedded MySQL
Server library, because the embedded server merely runs inside the threads
of the host application, it does not create connection threads of its own.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

When you do a @code{KILL}, a thread-specific kill flag is set for
the thread.
In most cases, it might take some time for the thread to die, because the kill
flag is checked only at specific intervals:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In @code{SELECT}, @code{ORDER BY} and @code{GROUP BY} loops, the flag is
checked after reading a block of rows. If the kill flag is set, the
statement is aborted.
@item
During @code{ALTER TABLE}, the kill flag is checked before each block of
rows are read from the original table. If the kill flag was set, the statement
is aborted and the temporary table is deleted.
@item
During @code{UPDATE} or @code{DELETE}, the kill flag
is checked after each block read and after each updated or deleted
row. If the kill flag is set, the statement is aborted.  Note that if you
are not using transactions, the changes will not be rolled back!
@item
@code{GET_LOCK()} will abort and return @code{NULL}.
@item
An @code{INSERT DELAYED} thread will quickly flush all rows it has in
memory and terminate.
@item
If the thread is in the table lock handler (state: @code{Locked}),
the table lock will be quickly aborted.

@end example

This statement preloads all index blocks from @code{t1}. It preloads only
blocks for the non-leaf nodes from @code{t2}.

The syntax of @code{LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE} allows you to specify that only
particular indexes from a table should be preloaded.  However, the current

Deletes all the binary logs listed in the log
index that are strictly prior to the specified log or date.
The logs also are removed from the list recorded in the log index file,
so that the given log becomes the first. 
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Example:

@example
PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010';
PURGE MASTER LOGS BEFORE '2003-04-02 22:46:26';
@end example

The @code{BEFORE} variant is available in MySQL 4.1; its date argument
can be in @code{'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'} format.
@code{MASTER} and @code{BINARY} are synonyms, but @code{BINARY} can be used
only as of MySQL 4.1.1.

If you have an active slave that is currently reading one of the logs you
are trying to delete, this statement does nothing and fails with an error.
However, if a slave is dormant and you happen to purge one of
the logs it wants to read, the slave will be unable to replicate once it
comes up.  The statement is safe to run while slaves are replicating. You
do not need to stop them.

To purge logs, follow this procedure:

@enumerate
@item
On each slave server, use @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} to check which log it is
reading.
@item
Obtain a listing of the logs on the master server with @code{SHOW MASTER LOGS}.

    | MASTER_SSL_CERT = 'cert_file_name'
    | MASTER_SSL_KEY = 'key_file_name'
    | MASTER_SSL_CIPHER = 'cipher_list'
@end example

Changes the parameters that the slave server uses for connecting to and
communicating with the master server.

The relay log options
(@code{RELAY_LOG_FILE} and @code{RELAY_LOG_POS}) are available beginning with
MySQL 4.0.

The SSL options
(@code{MASTER_SSL},
@code{MASTER_SSL_CA},
@code{MASTER_SSL_CAPATH},
@code{MASTER_SSL_CERT},
@code{MASTER_SSL_KEY},
and
@code{MASTER_SSL_CIPHER})
are available beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.
You can change these options even on slaves that are compiled without SSL
support. They are saved to the @file{master.info} file, but will be ignored
until you use a server that has SSL support enabled.

If you don't specify a given parameter, it keeps its old
value, except as indicated in the following discussion. For example, if the password to connect to your MySQL master has
changed, you just need to issue these statements
to tell the slave about the new password:

@example
mysql> STOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='new3cret';
mysql> START SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication
@end example

There is no need to specify the parameters that do
not change (host, port, user, and so forth).

@code{MASTER_HOST} and @code{MASTER_PORT} are the hostname (or IP address) of
the master host and its TCP port. Note that if @code{MASTER_HOST} is
equal to @code{localhost}, then, like in other parts of MySQL, the port
may be ignored (if Unix socket files can be used for example).

If you specify @code{MASTER_HOST} or @code{MASTER_PORT},
the slave assumes that the master server is different than
before (even if you specify a host or port value that is
the same as the current value.) In this case, the old values of master
binary log name and position are considered no longer applicable, so if you
do not specify @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} and @code{MASTER_LOG_POS} in the
statement, @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE=''} and @code{MASTER_LOG_POS=4} are
silently appended to it. 

@code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} and @code{MASTER_LOG_POS} are the coordinates
at which the slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the
next time the thread starts.
If you specify either of them, you can't specify @code{RELAY_LOG_FILE} or
@code{RELAY_LOG_POS}.
If neither of @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} or @code{MASTER_LOG_POS} are
specified, the last coordinates of the @strong{slave SQL thread}
before @code{CHANGE MASTER} was issued are used. This ensures that
replication has no discontinuity, even if the slave SQL thread was late
compared to the slave I/O thread, when you just want to change, say, the
password to use. This safe behavior was introduced starting from MySQL
4.0.17 and 4.1.1. (Before these versions, the used coordinates were 
the last coordinates of the slave I/O thread before @code{CHANGE MASTER}
was issued. This caused the SQL thread to possibly lose some events
from the master, thus breaking replication.)

@code{CHANGE MASTER} @strong{deletes all relay log files} (and starts
a new one), unless you specify @code{RELAY_LOG_FILE} or
@code{RELAY_LOG_POS} (in that case relay logs will be kept;
since MySQL 4.1.1 the @code{relay_log_purge} global variable
will silently be set to 0).

@code{CHANGE MASTER TO} updates the contents of the @file{master.info} and
@file{relay-log.info} files

@code{CHANGE MASTER} is useful for setting up a slave when you have
the snapshot of the master and have recorded the log and the offset
corresponding to it.  After loading the snapshot into the slave, you
can run @code{CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',
MASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master} on the slave.

Examples:

@example
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',
    ->     MASTER_USER='replication',
    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
    ->     MASTER_PORT=3306,
    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4,
    ->     MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;

mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',
    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;
@end example
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@code{MASTER_USER}, @code{MASTER_PASSWORD},
@code{MASTER_SSL}, @code{MASTER_SSL_CA},
@code{MASTER_SSL_CAPATH}, @code{MASTER_SSL_CERT}, @code{MASTER_SSL_KEY},
and @code{MASTER_SSL_CIPHER} provide information for the slave about how to
connect to its master.

The first example changes the master and master's binary log
coordinates. This is used when you want to set up the slave to replicate
the master.

The second example shows an operation that is less frequently used. It
is done when the slave has relay logs that you want it to execute again
for some reason.  To do this, the master need not be reachable. You just
have to use @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} and start the SQL thread (@code{START
SLAVE SQL_THREAD}).

You can even use the second operation in a non-replication setup with a
standalone, slave-of-nobody server, to recover after a crash.  Suppose that your
server has crashed and you have restored a backup.  You want to replay
the server's own binary logs (not relay logs, but regular binary logs),
supposedly named @file{myhost-bin.*}. First make a backup copy of these
binary logs in some safe place, in case you don't exactly follow the
procedure below and accidentally have the server purge the binary logs.
If using MySQL 4.1.1 or newer, use @code{SET GLOBAL relay_log_purge=0} for
additional safety.  Then start the server without the @code{log-bin}
option. Before MySQL 4.0.19, start it with a new (different from before) server
id; in newer versions there is no need, just use the
@code{--replicate-same-server-id} option. Start it with
@code{--relay-log=myhost-bin} (to make the server believe that these
regular binary logs are relay logs) and @code{--skip-slave-start}. After
the server starts, issue these statements:

@example
mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO
    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='myhost-bin.153',
    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=410,
    ->     MASTER_HOST='some_dummy_string';
mysql> START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
@end example

Then the server will read and execute its own binary logs, thus achieving
crash recovery.  Once the recovery is finished, run @code{STOP SLAVE},
shut down the server, delete @file{master.info} and @file{relay-log.info},
and restart the server with its original options.

For the moment, specifying @code{MASTER_HOST} (even with a dummy value) is
required to make the server think it is a slave. In the future, we plan to add
options to get rid of these small constraints.


@node LOAD DATA FROM MASTER, LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER, CHANGE MASTER TO, Replication Slave SQL
@subsubsection @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} Syntax

@findex LOAD DATA FROM MASTER

@c description_for_help_topic LOAD DATA FROM MASTER  LOAD DATA FROM MASTER
@example
LOAD DATA FROM MASTER
@end example

Takes a snapshot of the master and copies it to the slave.
It updates the values of @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} and
@code{MASTER_LOG_POS} so that the slave will start replicating from the
correct position. Any table and database exclusion rules
specified with @code{replicate-*-do-*} and @code{replicate-*-ignore-*}
options are honored. @code{replicate-rewrite-db} is NOT taken into account
(because one user could, with this option, set up a non-unique
mapping like this: @code{replicate-rewrite-db=db1->db3} and
@code{replicate-rewrite-db=db2->db3}, which would confuse the slave when it
loads the master's tables).

Use of this statement is subject to the following conditions:

@itemize @bullet

@item
It works only with @code{MyISAM} tables.

@item
It acquires a global read lock on the master while taking the snapshot,
which prevents updates on the master during the load operation.

@end itemize

In the future, it is planned to make this statement work with
@code{InnoDB} tables and to remove the need for a global read lock by using
the non-blocking online backup feature.

If you are loading big tables, you might have to increase the values
of @code{net_read_timeout} and @code{net_write_timeout}
on both your master and slave servers.
@xref{Server system variables}.

Note that @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} does @emph{not} copy any
tables from the @code{mysql} database.  This makes it easy to have
different users and privileges on the master and the slave.

The @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} statement
requires that the replication account that is used to connect to the master
has the @code{RELOAD} and @code{SUPER} privileges on the master and the
@code{SELECT} privilege for all master tables you want to load. All
master tables for which the user does not have the @code{SELECT} privilege are
ignored by @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}. This is because the
master will hide them from the user: @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} calls
@code{SHOW DATABASES} to know the master databases to load, but
@code{SHOW DATABASES} returns only databases for which the user has
some privilege.
See @ref{Show database info}.
On the slave's side, the user that issues @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} should
have grants to drop and create the databases and tables that are copied.

@subsubsection @code{LOAD TABLE tbl_name FROM MASTER} Syntax

@findex LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER

@c description_for_help_topic LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER  LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER
@example
LOAD TABLE tbl_name FROM MASTER
@end example

Downloads a copy of the table from master to the slave. This statement is
implemented mainly for debugging of @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}.
It requires that the account used for connecting to the master server has the
@code{RELOAD} and @code{SUPER} privileges on the master and the
@code{SELECT} privilege on the master table to load.
On the slave side, the user that issues @code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} should
have grants to drop and create the table.

The conditions for @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} apply here, too. For
example, @code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} works only for @code{MyISAM} tables.
The timeout notes for @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} apply as well.

@c description_for_help_topic RESET SLAVE  RESET SLAVE
@example
RESET SLAVE
@end example

Makes the slave forget its replication position in the master's binary logs.
This statement is meant to be used for a clean start: It deletes the
@file{master.info} and @file{relay-log.info} files, all the relay logs,
and starts a new relay log.  @strong{Note:} All relay logs are deleted,
even if they have not been totally executed by the slave SQL thread.
(This is a condition likely to exist on a replication slave if you have
issued a @code{STOP SLAVE} statement or if the slave is highly loaded.)

Connection information stored in the @file{master.info} file is immediately
reset using any values specified in the corresponding startup options.
This information includes values such as master host, master port, master
user, and master password.  If the slave SQL thread was in the middle of
replicating temporary tables when it was stopped, and @code{RESET SLAVE}
is issued, these replicated temporary tables are deleted on the slave.

This statement was named @code{FLUSH SLAVE} before MySQL 3.23.26.

Skip the next @code{n} events from the master. This is
useful for recovering from replication stops caused by a statement.

This statement is valid only when the slave thread is not running.

Depending on your version of MySQL, you may not see all the fields just
shown. In particular, several fields are present only as of MySQL 4.1.1.

@code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} returns the following fields:

@table @code

@item Slave_IO_State
A copy of the @code{State} field of
the output of @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} for the slave I/O thread. This
tells you if the thread is trying to connect to the master, waiting
for events from the master, reconnecting to the master, and so on. Possible
states are listed in @ref{Replication Implementation Details}. Looking at
this field is necessary because, for example, the thread can be running
but unsuccessfully trying to connect to the master; only this field
will make you aware of the connection problem.
On the opposite, the state of the SQL thread is not copied, because
things are simpler for this thread: If it's running, there is no
problem; if it's not, you will find the error in the
@code{Last_Error} field (described below). 

This field is present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@item Master_Host
The current master host.

@item Master_User
The current user used to connect to the master.

@item Master_Port
The current master port.

@item Connect_Retry
The current value of the @code{--master-connect-retry} option.

@item Master_Log_File
The name of the master binary log file from which the I/O thread is
currently reading.

@item Read_Master_Log_Pos
The position up to which the I/O thread has read in the current master binary log.

@item Relay_Log_File
The name of the relay log file from which the SQL thread is currently
reading and executing.

@item Relay_Log_Pos
The position up to which the SQL thread has read and executed in the current relay log.

@item Relay_Master_Log_File
The name of the master binary log file that contains the
last event executed by the SQL thread.

@item Slave_IO_Running
Whether or not the I/O thread is started.

@item Slave_SQL_Running
Whether or not the SQL thread is started.

@item Replicate_Do_DB, Replicate_Ignore_DB
The lists of databases that were specified with the
@code{--replicate-do-db} and @code{--replicate-ignore-db} options, if any.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@item Replicate_Do_Table, Replicate_Ignore_Table, Replicate_Wild_Do_Table, Replicate_Wild_Ignore_Table

The lists of tables that were specified with the
@code{--replicate-do-table},
@code{--replicate-ignore-table},
@code{--replicate-wild-do-table},
and
@code{--replicate-wild-ignore_table}
options, if any.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@item Last_Errno, Last_Error
The error number and error message returned by the most recently executed query.
An error number of 0 and message of the empty string mean ``no error.''
If the @code{Last_Error} value is not empty, it will also appear as a
message in the slave's error log.

For example:

@example
Last_Errno: 1051
Last_Error: error 'Unknown table 'z'' on query 'drop table z'
@end example

The message indicates that
the table @code{z} existed on the master and was dropped there, but it
did not exist on the slave, so @code{DROP TABLE} failed on the slave.
(This might occur, for example, if you forget to copy the table to the
slave when setting up replication.)

@item Skip_Counter
The last used value for @code{SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER}.

@item Exec_Master_Log_Pos
The position of the last event executed by the SQL thread
from the master's binary log (@code{Relay_Master_Log_File}).
(@code{Relay_Master_Log_File}, @code{Exec_Master_Log_Pos}) in the
master's binary log corresponds to
(@code{Relay_Log_File}, @code{Relay_Log_Pos})
in the relay log.

@item Relay_Log_Space
The total combined size of all existing relay logs.

@item Until_Condition, Until_Log_File, Until_Log_Pos

The values specified in the @code{UNTIL} clause of the @code{START SLAVE}
statement.

@code{Until_Condition} has these values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{None} if no @code{UNTIL} clause was specified
@item
@code{Master} if the slave is reading until a given position in the master's
binary logs
@item
@code{Relay} if the slave is reading until a given position in its relay logs
@end itemize

@code{Until_Log_File} and @code{Until_Log_Pos} indicate the log filename and
position values that define the point at which the SQL thread will stop
executing.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@item Master_SSL_Allowed, Master_SSL_CA_File, Master_SSL_CA_Path, Master_SSL_Cert, Master_SSL_Cipher, Master_SSL_Key

These fields show the
the SSL parameters used by the slave to connect to the master, if any.

@code{Master_SSL_Allowed} has these values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{Yes} if an SSL connection to the master is allowed
@item
@code{No} if an SSL connection to the master is not allowed
@item
@code{Ignored} if an SSL connection is allowed but the slave server does not
have SSL support enabled
@end itemize

The values of the other SSL-related fields correspond to the values of the
@code{--master-ca},
@code{--master-capath},
@code{--master-cert},
@code{--master-cipher},
and
@code{--master-key}
options.

These fields are present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@item Seconds_Behind_Master
The number of seconds that have elapsed since the timestamp of the last
master's event executed by the slave SQL thread. This will be @code{NULL}
when no event has been executed yet, or after @code{CHANGE MASTER} and
@code{RESET SLAVE}. This field can be used to know how ``late'' your slave
is. It will work even though your master and slave don't have identical
clocks.

This field is present beginning with MySQL 4.1.1.

@end example

@code{START SLAVE} with no options starts both of the slave threads.
The I/O thread reads queries from the master server and stores them in the
relay log.  The SQL thread reads the relay log and executes the
queries.
@code{START SLAVE} requires the @code{SUPER} privilege.

If @code{START SLAVE} succeeds in starting the slave threads, it
returns without any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the slave
threads start and then later stop (for example, because they don't manage to
connect to the master or read its binary logs, or some other
problem). @code{START SLAVE} will not warn you about this. You must
check your slave's error log for error messages generated by
the slave threads, or check that they are running fine with @code{SHOW
SLAVE STATUS}.

@c end_description_for_help_topic

As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can add @code{IO_THREAD} and @code{SQL_THREAD}
options to the statement to name which of the threads to start.

As of MySQL 4.1.1, an @code{UNTIL} clause may be added to specify that
the slave should start and run until the SQL thread reaches a given point in
the master binary logs or in the slave relay logs. When the SQL thread reaches
that point, it stops.  If the @code{SQL_THREAD} option is specified in the
statement, it starts only the SQL thread.  Otherwise, it starts both slave
threads.  If the SQL thread is already running, the @code{UNTIL} clause is
ignored and a warning is issued.

With an @code{UNTIL} clause, you must specify both a log filename and
position. Do not mix master and relay log options.

Any @code{UNTIL} condition is reset by a subsequent @code{STOP SLAVE}
statement, a @code{START SLAVE} statement that includes no @code{UNTIL}
clause, or a server restart.

The @code{UNTIL} clause can be useful for debugging replication, or to
cause replication to proceed until just before the point where you want
to avoid having the slave replicate a statement. For example, if an unwise
@code{DROP TABLE} statement was executed on the master, you can use
@code{UNTIL} to tell the slave to execute up to that point but no farther.
To find what the event is, use @code{mysqlbinlog} with the master logs or
slave relay logs, or by using a @code{SHOW BINLOG EVENTS} statement.

If you are using @code{UNTIL} to have the slave process replicated queries in
sections, it is recommended that you start the slave with the
@code{--skip-slave-start} option to prevent the SQL thread from running
when the slave server starts.  It's probably best to use this option in an
option file rather than on the command line, so that an unexpected server
restart does not cause it to be forgotten.

The @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} statement includes output fields that display
the current values of the @code{UNTIL} condition.

This statement is called @code{SLAVE START} before MySQL 4.0.5.
For the moment, @code{SLAVE START} is still accepted for backward
compatibility, but is deprecated.

MySQL supports several storage engines that act as handlers for different
table types. MySQL storage engines include both those that handle
transaction-safe tables and those that handle non-transaction-safe tables:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The original storage engine was @code{ISAM}, which managed non-transactional
tables. This engine has been replaced by @code{MyISAM} and should no longer
be used. It is deprecated in MySQL 4.1, and will be removed in MySQL 5.0.

@item
In MySQL 3.23.0, the @code{MyISAM} and @code{HEAP} storage engines were
introduced.  @code{MyISAM} is an improved replacement for @code{ISAM}.
The @code{HEAP} storage engine provides in-memory tables.
The @code{MERGE} storage engine was
added in MySQL 3.23.25.  It allows a collection of identical @code{MyISAM}
tables to be handled as a single table.  All three of these storage engines
handle non-transactional tables, and all are included in MySQL by default.
Note that the
@code{HEAP} storage engine now
is known as the @code{MEMORY} engine.

@item
The @code{InnoDB} and @code{BDB}
storage engines that handle transaction-safe tables were introduced in later
versions of MySQL 3.23.
Both are available in source distributions as of MySQL 3.23.34a.
@code{BDB} is included in MySQL-Max binary distributions on those operating
systems that support it.  @code{InnoDB} also is included in MySQL-Max binary
distributions for MySQL 3.23.  Beginning with MySQL 4.0, @code{InnoDB}
is included by default in all MySQL binary distributions.  In source
distributions, you can enable or disable either engine by configuring MySQL
as you like.

@c TODO: update for NDB when appropriate

@end itemize

This chapter describes each of the MySQL storage engines except for
@code{InnoDB}, which is covered in @ref{InnoDB}.

When you create a new table, you can tell MySQL what type of table to create
by adding an @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} table option to the @code{CREATE
TABLE} statement:

@example
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = INNODB;
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) TYPE = MEMORY;
@end example

@code{ENGINE} is the preferred term, but cannot be used before MySQL 4.0.18.
@code{TYPE} is available beginning with MySQL 3.23.0, the first
version of MySQL for which multiple storage engines were available.

If you omit the @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} option,
the default table type is usually @code{MyISAM}.
This can be changed by setting the @code{table_type} system variable.

To convert a table from one type to another, use an @code{ALTER TABLE}
statement that indicates the new type:

@example
ALTER TABLE t ENGINE = MYISAM;
ALTER TABLE t TYPE = BDB;
@end example

See @ref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}} and
@ref{ALTER TABLE, , @code{ALTER TABLE}}.

@c We should consider removing this or making a new section 'What happens when a
@c table is created'. Currently it seems a bit out of place and not that
@c helpful.

If you try to use a storage engine that is not compiled in or that is
compiled in but deactivated, MySQL instead creates a table of type
@code{MyISAM}.  This behavior is convenient when you want to copy tables
between MySQL servers that support different storage engines. (For example, in
a replication setup, perhaps your
master server supports transactional storage engines for increased safety,
but the slave servers use only non-transactional storage engines for greater
speed.)

This automatic automatic substitution of the @code{MyISAM} table type when an
unavailable type is specified can be confusing for new MySQL
users.  In MySQL 4.1 and up, a warning is generated when a table type is
automatically changed.

MySQL always creates an @file{.frm} file to hold the table and column
definitions. The table's index and data may be stored in one or more other
files, depending on the table type.
The server creates the @file{.frm} file above the storage engine level.
Individual storage engines create any additional files required for the tables
that they manage.

A database may contain tables of different types.

Transaction-safe tables (TSTs) have several advantages over
non-transaction-safe tables (NTSTs):

@itemize @bullet
@item
Safer. Even if MySQL crashes or you get hardware problems, you
can get your data back, either by automatic recovery or from a backup
plus the transaction log.
@item
You can combine many statements and accept them all at the same time with
the @code{COMMIT} statement (if autocommit is disabled).
@item
You can execute @code{ROLLBACK} to ignore your changes (if
autocommit is disabled).
@item
If an update fails, all your changes will be restored. (With
non-transaction-safe tables, all
changes that have taken place are permanent.)
@item
Transaction-safe storage engines
can provide better concurrency for tables that get many updates concurrently
with reads.
@end itemize

Note that to use the @code{InnoDB} storage engine in MySQL 3.23, you
must configure at least the @code{innodb_data_file_path} startup option.
In 4.0 and up, @code{InnoDB} uses default configuration values if you specify
none.
@xref{InnoDB configuration,  , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.

Non-transaction-safe tables have several advantages of their own, all
of which occur because there is no transaction overhead:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Much faster
@item
Lower disk space requirements
@item
Less memory required to perform updates
@end itemize

You can combine transaction-safe and non-transaction-safe tables in the same statements to get the best
of both worlds. However, within a transaction with autocommit disabled,
changes to non-transaction-safe tables still are committed immediately and
cannot be rolled back.

@section The @code{MyISAM} Storage Engine

@cindex @code{MyISAM} storage engine
@cindex @code{MyISAM} table type
@cindex tables, @code{MyISAM}

@code{MyISAM} is the default storage engine as of MySQL 3.23. It is
based on the @code{ISAM} code but has many useful extensions.

Each @code{MyISAM} table is stored on disk in three files.  The files have
names that begin with the table name and have an extension to indicate the
file type.  An @file{.frm} file stores the table definition.  The data file
has an @file{.MYD} (MYData) extension.  The index file has an @file{.MYI}
(MYIndex) extension,

To specify explicitly that you want a @code{MyISAM} table, indicate that with
an @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} table option:

@example
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = MYISAM;
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) TYPE = MYISAM;
@end example

Normally, the @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} option is unnecessary;
@code{MyISAM} is the default storage engine unless the default has been
changed.

You can check or repair @code{MyISAM} tables with the @code{myisamchk}
utility. @xref{Crash recovery}. You can compress @code{MyISAM} tables with
@code{myisampack} to take up much less space.
@xref{myisampack, , @code{myisampack}}.

The following characteristics of the @code{MyISAM} storage engine are
improvements over the older @code{ISAM} engine:

@itemize @bullet

@item
All data values are stored with the low byte first. This makes the data
machine and operating system independent. The only requirement for binary
portability is that the machine uses two's-complement signed integers
(as every machine for the last 20 years has) and IEEE floating-point
format (also totally dominant among mainstream machines). The only area of
machines that may not support binary compatibility are embedded systems,
which sometimes have peculiar processors.

There is no big speed penalty for storing data low byte first; the bytes
in a table row normally are unaligned and it doesn't take that much more
power to read an unaligned byte in order than in reverse order.  Also, the
code in the server that fetches column values is not time critical compared
to other code.

@item
Large files (up to 63-bit file length) are supported on
filesystems and operating systems that support large files.

@item
Dynamic-sized rows are much less fragmented when mixing deletes
with updates and inserts.  This is done by automatically combining adjacent
deleted blocks and by extending blocks if the next block is deleted.

@item
The maximum number of indexes per table is 64 (32 before MySQL 4.1.2).  This
can be changed by recompiling.  The maximum number of columns per index is 16.

@item
The maximum key length is 1000 bytes (500 before MySQL 4.1.2).
This can be changed by recompiling.  For the case of a key longer than
250 bytes, a larger key block size than the default of 1024 bytes is used.

@item
@code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns can be indexed.

@item
@code{NULL} values are allowed in indexed columns.  This takes 0-1
bytes per key.

@item
All numeric key values are stored with the high byte first to allow better index
compression.

@item
Index files are usually much smaller with @code{MyISAM} than with
@code{ISAM}. This means that @code{MyISAM} normally will use less
system resources than @code{ISAM}, but will need more CPU time when inserting
data into a compressed index.

@item
When records are inserted in sorted order (as when you are using an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column), the index tree is split so that the high
node only contains one key. This improves space utilization in the index
tree.

@item
Internal handling of one @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column per table.
@code{MyISAM} automatically updates this column for @code{INSERT/UPDATE}.  This
makes @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns faster (at least 10%).
Values at the top of the sequence are not reused after being deleted as they
are with @code{ISAM}.  (When an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column is
defined as the last column of a multiple-column index, reuse of deleted
values does occur.)  The @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value can be reset with
@code{ALTER TABLE} or @code{myisamchk}.

@item
If a table doesn't have free blocks in the middle of the data file, you can
@code{INSERT} new rows into it at the same time that other threads are
reading from the table. (These are known as concurrent inserts.) A free block can
occur as a result of deleting rows or an update of a dynamic length row with
more data than its current contents.  When all free blocks are used up
(filled in), future inserts become concurrent again.

@item
You can put the data file and index file on different directories
to get more speed with the @code{DATA DIRECTORY} and @code{INDEX DIRECTORY}
table options to
@code{CREATE TABLE}. @xref{CREATE TABLE,  , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

@item
As of MySQL 4.1, each character column can have a different character set.

@item
There is a flag in the @code{MyISAM} index file that indicates whether the
table was closed correctly.  If @code{mysqld} is started with the
@code{--myisam-recover} option, @code{MyISAM} tables are automatically
checked (and optionally repaired) when opened if the table wasn't closed
properly.

@item
@code{myisamchk} marks tables as checked if you run it with the
@code{--update-state} option. @code{myisamchk --fast} checks only those
tables that don't have this mark.

@item
@code{myisamchk --analyze} stores statistics for key parts, not only for
whole keys as in @code{ISAM}.

@item
@code{myisampack} can pack @code{BLOB} and @code{VARCHAR} columns;
@code{pack_isam} cannot.

@end itemize

@code{MyISAM} also supports the following features, which MySQL
will be able to use in the near future:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Support for a true @code{VARCHAR} type; a @code{VARCHAR} column starts
with a length stored in two bytes.

@item
Tables with @code{VARCHAR} may have fixed or dynamic record length.

@item
@code{VARCHAR} and @code{CHAR} columns may be up to 64KB.

@item
A hashed computed index can be used for @code{UNIQUE}. This will allow
you to have @code{UNIQUE} on any combination of columns in a table. (You
can't search on a @code{UNIQUE} computed index, however.)

@table @code

@item --myisam-recover=mode

Set the mode for automatic recovery of crashed @code{MyISAM} tables.

@item --delay-key-write=ALL

Don't flush key buffers between writes for any @code{MyISAM} table.

@strong{Note:} If you do this, you should not use @code{MyISAM} tables from
another program (such as from another MySQL server or with @code{myisamchk}) when
the table is in use. Doing so will lead to index corruption.

Using @code{--external-lock} will not help for tables that use
@code{--delay-key-write}.

@end table

@xref{Server options}.

The following system variables affect the behavior of
@code{MyISAM} tables:

@table @code

@item bulk_insert_buffer_size

The size of the tree cache used in bulk insert
optimization. @strong{Note:} This is a limit @emph{per thread}!

@item myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size

Used to help MySQL to decide when to use the slow but safe key cache index
creation method. @strong{Note:} This parameter is given in megabytes
before MySQL 4.0.3, and in bytes as of 4.0.3.

@item myisam_max_sort_file_size

Don't use the fast sort index method to create an index if the temporary
file would become larger than this.  @strong{Note:} This parameter is
given in megabytes before MySQL 4.0.3, and in bytes as of 4.0.3.

@item myisam_sort_buffer_size

Set the size of the buffer used when recovering tables.

@end table

@xref{Server system variables}.

Automatic recovery is activated if you start @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--myisam-recover} option. In this case, when the server opens a
@code{MyISAM} table, it checks whether the table
is marked as crashed or whether the open count variable for the
table is not 0 and you are running the server with
@code{--skip-external-locking}.  If either of these conditions is true, the
following happens:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The table is checked for errors.

@item
If the server finds an error, it tries to do a fast table repair (with
sorting and without re-creating the data file).

@item
If the repair fails because of an error in the data file (for example, a
duplicate-key error), the server tries again, this time re-creating the
data file.

@item
If the repair still fails, the server tries once more with the old repair option
method (write row by row without sorting). This method should be able to repair
any type of error and has low disk space requirements.

@end itemize

If the recovery wouldn't be able to recover all rows from a previous
completed statement and you didn't specify @code{FORCE} in the value of the
@code{--myisam-recover} option, automatic repair aborts with an error
message in the error log:

@example
Error: Couldn't repair table: test.g00pages
@end example

If you specify @code{FORCE}, a warning like this is written instead:

@example
Warning: Found 344 of 354 rows when repairing ./test/g00pages
@end example

Note that if the automatic recovery value includes @code{BACKUP}, the
recovery process creates files with names of the form
@file{tbl_name-datetime.BAK}.  You should have a @code{cron} script that
automatically moves these files from the database directories to backup
media.


@node Key space, MyISAM table formats, MyISAM start, MyISAM
@subsection Space Needed for Keys

@cindex key space, MyISAM

@code{MyISAM} tables use B-tree indexes. You can roughly calculate
the size for the index file as @code{(key_length+4)/0.67}, summed over
all keys.  This is for the worst case when all keys are inserted in
sorted order and the table doesn't have any compressed keys.

String indexes are space compressed. If the first index part is a
string, it will also be prefix compressed.  Space compression makes the
index file smaller than the worst-case figure if the string column has a lot
of trailing space or is a @code{VARCHAR} column that is not always used
to the full length. Prefix compression is used on keys that start
with a string.  Prefix compression helps if there are many strings
with an identical prefix.

In @code{MyISAM} tables, you can also prefix compress numbers by specifying
@code{PACK_KEYS=1} when you create the table.  This helps when you have
many integer keys that have an identical prefix when the numbers are stored
high-byte first.


@node MyISAM table formats, MyISAM table problems, Key space, MyISAM
@subsection @code{MyISAM} Table Storage Formats

@code{MyISAM} supports three different storage formats. Two of them (fixed
and dynamic format) are chosen automatically depending on the type of
columns you are using. The third, compressed format, can be created only
with the @code{myisampack} utility.

When you @code{CREATE} or @code{ALTER} a table that has no @code{BLOB}
or @code{TEXT} columns, you can force the table format to @code{FIXED} or
@code{DYNAMIC} with the @code{ROW_FORMAT} table option. This causes
@code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} columns to become @code{CHAR} for
@code{FIXED} format or @code{VARCHAR} for @code{DYNAMIC} format.

In the future, you will be able to compress or decompress tables by specifying
@code{ROW_FORMAT=@{COMPRESSED | DEFAULT@}} to @code{ALTER TABLE}.

@end menu


@node Static format, Dynamic format, MyISAM table formats, MyISAM table formats
@subsubsection Static (Fixed-Length) Table Characteristics

Static format is the default for @code{MyISAM} tables.  It is used when the
table contains no variable-length columns (@code{VARCHAR}, @code{BLOB}, or
@code{TEXT}). Each row is stored using a fixed number of bytes.

Of the three @code{MyISAM} storage formats, static format is the simplest
and most secure (least subject to corruption). It is also the fastest of the
on-disk formats. The speed comes from the easy way that rows in the data file
can be found on disk: When looking up a row based on a row number in the
index, multiply the row number by the row length.  Also, when scanning a
table, it is very easy to read a constant number of records with each disk
read operation.

The security is evidenced if your computer crashes while the MySQL server is
writing to a fixed-format @code{MyISAM} file. In this case, @code{myisamchk}
can easily determine where each row starts and ends, so it can usually
reclaim all records except the partially written one. Note that @code{MyISAM}
table
indexes can always be reconstructed based on the data rows.

General characteristics of static format tables:

@itemize @bullet

@item
All @code{CHAR}, @code{NUMERIC}, and @code{DECIMAL} columns are space-padded
to the column width.

@item
Very quick.

@item
Easy to cache.

@item
Easy to reconstruct after a crash, because records are located in fixed
positions.

@item
Reorganization is unnecessary unless you delete a huge number of records
and want to return free disk space to the operating system. To do this,
use @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{myisamchk -r}.

@item
Usually require more disk space than for dynamic-format tables.

@end itemize


@node Dynamic format, Compressed format, Static format, MyISAM table formats
@subsubsection Dynamic Table Characteristics

@cindex dynamic table characteristics
@cindex tables, dynamic

Dynamic storage format is used if a @code{MyISAM} table contains any
variable-length columns (@code{VARCHAR}, @code{BLOB}, or @code{TEXT}), or if
the table was created with the @code{ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC} option.

This format is a little more complex because each row has a header that
indicates
how long it is. One record can also end up at more than one location when it
is made longer as a result of an update.

@cindex tables, defragment
You can use @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{myisamchk} to defragment a
table. If you have fixed-length columns that you access or change frequently
in a table that also contains some variable-length columns, it might be
a good idea to move the variable-length columns to other tables just to
avoid fragmentation.

General characteristics of dynamic-format tables:

@itemize @bullet

@item
All string columns are dynamic except those with a length less than four.

@item
Each record is preceded by a bitmap that indicates which columns contain the
empty string (for string columns) or zero (for numeric columns). Note that
this does not include columns that contain @code{NULL} values. If a string
column has a length of zero after trailing space removal, or a numeric
column has a value of zero, it is marked in the bitmap and not saved to
disk.  Non-empty strings are saved as a length byte plus the string
contents.

@item
Much less disk space usually is required than for fixed-length tables.

@item
Each record uses only as much space as is required. However, if a record
becomes larger, it is split into as many pieces as are required, resulting
in record fragmentation.  For example, if you update a row with information
that extends the row length, the row will be fragmented.  In this case,
you may have to run @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{myisamchk -r} from time to time to get better
performance.  Use @code{myisamchk -ei} to obtain table statistics.

@item
More difficult than static-format tables to reconstruct after a crash,
because a record may be fragmented into many pieces and a link (fragment)
may be missing.

@item
The expected row length for dynamic-sized records is calculated using the
following expression:

@example
3
+ (number of columns + 7) / 8
+ (number of char columns)
+ (packed size of numeric columns)
+ (length of strings)
+ (number of NULL columns + 7) / 8
@end example

There is a penalty of 6 bytes for each link. A dynamic record is linked
whenever an update causes an enlargement of the record. Each new link will be
at least 20 bytes, so the next enlargement will probably go in the same link.
If not, there will be another link. You may check how many links there are
with @code{myisamchk -ed}. All links may be removed with @code{myisamchk -r}.

default. (This is when MySQL was placed under the GPL.) For earlier
versions, @code{myisampack} was included only with licenses or support
agreements, but the server still can read tables that were compressed
with @code{myisampack}.  Compressed tables can be uncompressed with
@code{myisamchk}.  (For the @code{ISAM} storage engine, compressed tables
can be created with @code{pack_isam} and uncompressed with @code{isamchk}.)

Compressed tables have the following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Compressed tables take very little disk space. This minimizes disk usage, which
is very nice when using slow disks (such as CD-ROMs).

@item
Each record is compressed separately, so there is very little access overhead.  The
header for a record is fixed (1-3 bytes) depending on the biggest record in the
table.  Each column is compressed differently.  There is usually a different
Huffman tree for each column.  Some of the compression types are:

@itemize @minus

@item
Suffix space compression.

@item
Prefix space compression.

@item
Numbers with a value of zero are stored using one bit.

@item
If values in an integer column have a small range, the column is stored
using the smallest possible type. For example, a @code{BIGINT} column
(eight bytes) can be stored as a @code{TINYINT} column (one byte) if all
its values are in the range from @code{-128} to @code{127}.

@item
If a column has only a small set of possible values, the column type is
converted to @code{ENUM}.

@item
A column may use a combination of the preceding compressions.

@item

@subsubsection Corrupted @code{MyISAM} Tables

Even though the @code{MyISAM} table format is very reliable (all changes to
a table made by an SQL statement are written before the statement returns),
you can still get corrupted tables if some of the following things happen:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @code{mysqld} process is killed in the middle of a write.

@item
Unexpected computer shutdown occurs (for example, the computer is turned off).

@item
Hardware errors.

@item
You are using an external program (such as @code{myisamchk}) on a table that
is being modified by the server at the same time.

@item
A software bug in the MySQL or @code{MyISAM} code.

@end itemize

Typical symptoms for a corrupt table are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You get the following error while selecting data from the table:

@example
Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to repair it
@end example

@item
Queries don't find rows in the table or return incomplete data.

@end itemize

You can check whether a @code{MyISAM} table is okay with the @code{CHECK
TABLE} statement.  You can repair a corrupted @code{MyISAM} table with
@code{REPAIR TABLE}.  When @code{mysqld} is not running, you can also
check or repair a table with the @code{myisamchk} command.
See @ref{CHECK TABLE,  , @code{CHECK TABLE}},
@ref{REPAIR TABLE,  , @code{REPAIR TABLE}}, and @ref{myisamchk syntax}.

If your tables become corrupted frequently, you should try to determine why
this is happening.  The most important thing to know is whether the table
became corrupted as a result of a server crash. You can verify this easily
by looking for a recent @code{restarted mysqld} message in the error log.
If there is such a message, it is likely that that table corruption is a
result of the server dying.  Otherwise, corruption may have occurred during
normal operation, which is a bug. You should try to create a reproducible
test case that demonstrates the problem.
See @ref{Crashing} and @ref{Reproduceable test case}.


@node MyISAM table close,  , Corrupted MyISAM tables, MyISAM table problems
@subsubsection Problems from Tables Not Being Closed Properly

Each @code{MyISAM} index (@file{.MYI}) file has a counter in the header
that can be used to check whether a table has been closed properly.
If you get the following warning from @code{CHECK TABLE} or @code{myisamchk},
it means that this counter has gone out of sync:

@example
clients are using or haven't closed the table properly
@end example

This warning doesn't necessarily mean that the table is corrupted, but
you should at least check the table to verify that it's okay.

The counter works as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The first time a table is updated in MySQL, a counter in the
header of the index files is incremented.

@item
The counter is not changed during further updates.

@item
When the last instance of a table is closed (because of a @code{FLUSH
TABLES} operation or because there isn't room in the table cache), the
counter is decremented if the table has been updated at any point.

@item
When you repair the table or check the table and it is found to be okay,
the counter is reset to zero.

@item
To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that might
check the table, the counter is not decremented on close if it was zero.

@end itemize

In other words, the counter can go out of sync only under these conditions:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @code{MyISAM} tables are copied without a preceding @code{LOCK TABLES} and
@code{FLUSH TABLES}.

@item
MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close.
(Note that the table may still be okay, because MySQL always issues writes
for everything between each statement.)

@item
A table was modified by @code{myisamchk --recover} or @code{myisamchk
--update-state} at the same time that it was in use by @code{mysqld}.

@item
Many @code{mysqld} servers are using the table and one server performed a
@code{REPAIR TABLE} or @code{CHECK TABLE} on the table while it was in use by
another server.  In this setup, it is safe to use @code{CHECK TABLE},
although you might get the warning from other servers. However, @code{REPAIR
TABLE} should be avoided because when one server replaces the data file
with a new one, this is not signaled to the other servers.

In general, it is a bad idea to share a data directory among multiple servers.

* MERGE table problems::        @code{MERGE} Table Problems
@end menu

The @code{MERGE} storage engine was introduced in MySQL 3.23.25. It
is also known as the @code{MRG_MyISAM} engine. The code is now reasonably
stable.

A @code{MERGE} table is a collection of identical @code{MyISAM} tables that
can be used as one.  ``Identical'' means that all tables have
identical column and index information.  You can't merge tables in which the
columns are packed differently, don't have exactly the same columns, or
have the indexes in different order.  However, any or all of the tables can be
compressed with @code{myisampack}.
@xref{myisampack, , @code{myisampack}}.
@c end_description_for_help_topic


When you create a @code{MERGE} table, MySQL creates two files on disk.
The files have names that begin with the table name and have an extension
to indicate the file type.  An @file{.frm} file stores the table definition,
and an @file{.MRG} file contains the names of the tables that should be
used as one.  (Originally, all used tables had to be in the same database
as the @code{MERGE} table itself. This restriction has been lifted as of
MySQL 4.1.1.)

You can use @code{SELECT}, @code{DELETE}, @code{UPDATE}, and (as of MySQL
4.0) @code{INSERT} on the collection of tables.  For the moment, you must
have @code{SELECT}, @code{UPDATE}, and @code{DELETE} privileges on the
tables that you map to a @code{MERGE} table.

If you @code{DROP} the @code{MERGE} table, you are dropping only the
@code{MERGE} specification. The underlying tables are not affected.

When you create a @code{MERGE} table, you must specify a
@code{UNION=(list-of-tables)} clause that indicates which tables you want to
use as one. You can optionally specify an @code{INSERT_METHOD} option if you
want inserts for the @code{MERGE} table to happen in the first or last table
of the @code{UNION} list. If you don't specify any @code{INSERT_METHOD}
option or specify it with a value of @code{NO}, attempts to insert records
into the @code{MERGE} table result in an error.

The following example shows how to create a @code{MERGE} table:

@c example_for_help_topic MERGE
@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    message CHAR(20));
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->    message CHAR(20));
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ('Testing'),('table'),('t1');
mysql> INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ('Testing'),('table'),('t2');
mysql> CREATE TABLE total (
    ->    a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ->    message CHAR(20), INDEX(a))
    ->    TYPE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2) INSERT_METHOD=LAST;
@end example

Note that the @code{a} column is indexed in the @code{MERGE} table, but is
not declared as a @code{PRIMARY KEY} as it is in the underlying
@code{MyISAM} tables. This is necessary because a @code{MERGE} table cannot
enforce uniqueness over the set of underlying tables.

After creating the @code{MERGE} table, you can do things like this:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM total;
+---+---------+
| a | message |
+---+---------+
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t1      |
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t2      |
+---+---------+
@end example

Note that you can also manipulate the @file{.MRG} file directly from
outside of the MySQL server:

@example
shell> cd /mysql-data-directory/current-database
shell> ls -1 t1 t2 > total.MRG
shell> mysqladmin flush-tables
@end example

To remap a @code{MERGE} table to a different collection of @code{MyISAM}
tables, you can do one of the following:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{DROP} the table and re-create it.

@item
Use @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name UNION=(...)} to change the list of underlying
tables.

@item
Change the @file{.MRG} file and issue a @code{FLUSH TABLE} statement for the
@code{MERGE} table and all underlying tables to force the storage engine to
read the new definition file.

@end itemize

@code{MERGE} tables can help you solve the following problems:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put data from
different months into separate tables, compress some of them with
@code{myisampack}, and then create a @code{MERGE} table to use them as one.

@item
Obtain more speed. You can split a big read-only table based on some
criteria, and then put individual tables on different disks.
A @code{MERGE} table on this could be much faster than using
the big table. (You can also use a RAID table to get the same
kind of benefits.)

@item
Do more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you are looking
for, you can search in just one of the split tables for some queries
and use a @code{MERGE} table for others.  You can even have many
different @code{MERGE} tables that use overlapping sets of tables.

@item
Do more efficient repairs. It's easier to repair the individual tables that
are mapped to a @code{MERGE} table than to repair a single really big table.

@item
Instantly map many tables as one. A @code{MERGE} table need not maintain
an index of its own because it uses the indexes of the individual tables.
As a result, @code{MERGE} table collections are @emph{very} fast to create
or remap.  (Note that you must still specify the index definitions when
you create a @code{MERGE} table, even though no indexes are created.)

@item
If you have a set of tables that you join as a big table on demand or
batch, you should instead create a @code{MERGE} table on them on demand.
This is much faster and will save a lot of disk space.

@item
Exceed the file size limit for the operating system. Each @code{MyISAM} table
is bound by this limit, but a collection of @code{MyISAM} tables is not.

@item
You can create an alias or synonym for a @code{MyISAM} table by defining a
@code{MERGE} table that maps to that single table.  There should be no
really notable performance impact of doing this (only a couple of indirect
calls and @code{memcpy()} calls for each read).

@end itemize

The disadvantages of @code{MERGE} tables are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You can use only identical @code{MyISAM} tables for a @code{MERGE} table.

@item
@code{MERGE} tables use more file descriptors. If 10 clients are using a
@code{MERGE} table that maps to 10 tables, the server uses
(10*10) + 10 file descriptors.  (10 data file descriptors for each of the 10
clients, and 10 index file descriptors shared among the clients.)

@item
Key reads are slower. When you read a key, the @code{MERGE}
storage engine needs to issue a read on all underlying tables to check
which one most closely matches the given key.  If you then do a ``read-next,''
the @code{MERGE} storage engine needs to search the read buffers
to find the next key. Only when one key buffer is used up, the storage engine
will need to read the next key block. This makes @code{MERGE} keys much slower
on @code{eq_ref} searches, but not much slower on @code{ref} searches.
See @ref{EXPLAIN,  , @code{EXPLAIN}} for more information about @code{eq_ref}
and @code{ref}.

@node MERGE table problems,  , MERGE, MERGE
@subsection @code{MERGE} Table Problems

The following are the known problems with @code{MERGE} tables:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} to change a @code{MERGE} table to another
table type, the mapping to the underlying tables is lost. Instead, the rows
from the underlying @code{MyISAM} tables are copied into the altered table,
which then is assigned the new type.

@item
Before MySQL 4.1.1, all underlying tables and the @code{MERGE} table itself
had to be in the same database.

@item
@code{REPLACE} doesn't work.

@item
You can't use
@code{DROP TABLE},
@code{ALTER TABLE},
@code{DELETE FROM} without a @code{WHERE} clause,
@code{REPAIR TABLE},
@code{TRUNCATE TABLE},
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}, or
@code{ANALYZE TABLE}
on any of the tables that are
mapped into a @code{MERGE} table that is ``open.''  If you do this, the
@code{MERGE} table may still refer to the original table and you will
get unexpected results. The easiest way to work around this deficiency
is to issue  @code{FLUSH TABLES} statement to ensure that no @code{MERGE}
tables remain ``open.''

@item
A @code{MERGE} table cannot maintain @code{UNIQUE} constraints over the
whole table.  When you perform an @code{INSERT}, the data goes into the
first or last @code{MyISAM} table (depending on the value of the
@code{INSERT_METHOD} option). MySQL ensures that unique key values remain
unique within that @code{MyISAM} table, but not across all the tables in the
collection.

@item
Before MySQL 3.23.49, @code{DELETE FROM merge_table} used without a
@code{WHERE} clause only clears the mapping for the table. That is, it
incorrectly empties the @file{.MRG} file rather than deleting records from
the mapped tables.

@item
Using @code{RENAME TABLE} on an active @code{MERGE} table may corrupt the
table.  This will be fixed in MySQL 4.1.x.

@item
When you create a @code{MERGE} table, there is no check whether the
underlying tables exist and have identical structure.  When the @code{MERGE}
table is used, MySQL does a quick check that the record length for all
mapped tables is equal, but this is not foolproof.  If you create a
@code{MERGE} table from dissimilar @code{MyISAM} tables, you are very likely
to run into strange problems.

@item
Index order in the @code{MERGE} table and its underlying tables should be
the same.  If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} to add a @code{UNIQUE} index
to a table used in a @code{MERGE} table, and then use @code{ALTER TABLE} to
add a non-unique index on the @code{MERGE} table, the index order will be
different for the tables if there was an old non-unique index in the
underlying table. (This is because @code{ALTER TABLE} puts @code{UNIQUE}
indexes before non-unique indexes to be able to detect duplicate keys as early
as possible.)  Consequently, queries may return unexpected results.

@item
@code{DROP TABLE} on a table that is in use by a @code{MERGE} table does
not work on Windows because the @code{MERGE} storage engine does the table
mapping hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow
you to delete files that are open, you first must flush all @code{MERGE}
tables (with @code{FLUSH TABLES}) or drop the @code{MERGE} table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
views.

@section The @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) Storage Engine

@c TODO: parts of this may be true only for hash indexes. Now that
@c MEMORY supports BTREE indexes, some statements may need to be qualified.

@cindex @code{HEAP} table type
@cindex @code{MEMORY} storage engine
@cindex @code{MEMORY} table type
@cindex tables, @code{MEMORY}
@cindex tables, @code{HEAP}

The @code{MEMORY} storage engine creates tables with contents that are stored
in memory. Before MySQL 4.1, @code{MEMORY} tables are called @code{HEAP}
tables. As of 4.1, @code{HEAP} is a synonym for @code{MEMORY}, and
@code{MEMORY} is the preferred term.

Each @code{MEMORY} table is associated with one disk file.  The filename
begins with the table name and has an extension of @file{.frm} to indicate
that it stores the table definition.

To specify explicitly that you want a @code{MEMORY} table, indicate that with
an @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} table option:

@example
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = MEMORY;
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) TYPE = HEAP;
@end example

@code{MEMORY} tables are stored in memory and use hash indexes.  This makes
them very fast, and very useful for creating temporary tables!  However,
when the server shuts down, all data stored in @code{MEMORY} tables is lost.
The tables continue to exist because their definitions are stored in the
@file{.frm} files on disk, but their contents will be empty when the server
restarts.

Here is an example that shows how you might create, use, and remove a
@code{MEMORY} table:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE test TYPE=MEMORY
    ->     SELECT ip,SUM(downloads) AS down
    ->     FROM log_table GROUP BY ip;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(ip),AVG(down) FROM test;
mysql> DROP TABLE test;
@end example

@code{MEMORY} tables have the following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Space for @code{MEMORY} tables is allocated in small blocks. The tables use
100% dynamic hashing (on inserting). No overflow areas and no extra key
space are needed.  There is no extra space needed for free lists.  Deleted
rows are put in a linked list and are reused when you insert new data into
the table.  @code{MEMORY} tables also don't have problems with deletes plus
inserts, which is common with hashed tables.

@item
@code{MEMORY} tables allow up to 32 indexes per table, 16 columns per index,
and a maximum key length of 500 bytes.

@item
Before MySQL 4.1, the @code{MEMORY} storage engine implements only hash
indexes.  From MySQL 4.1 on,
hash indexes are still the default, but
you can specify explicitly that a @code{MEMORY}
table index should be @code{HASH} or @code{BTREE} by adding a @code{USING}
clause:

@example
CREATE TABLE lookup
    (id INT, INDEX USING HASH (id))
    ENGINE = MEMORY;
CREATE TABLE lookup
    (id INT, INDEX USING BTREE (id))
    ENGINE = MEMORY;
@end example

General characteristics of B-tree and hash indexes are described in
@ref{MySQL indexes}.

@item
You can have non-unique keys in a @code{MEMORY} table.
(This is an uncommon feature for implementations of hash indexes.)

@item
If you have a hash index on a @code{MEMORY} table that has a high degree of
key duplication (many index entries containing the same value), updates to
the table that affect key values and all deletes will be significantly
slower.  The degree of slowdown is proportional to the degree of duplication
(or, inversely proportional to the index cardinality).  You can use a
@code{BTREE} index to avoid this problem.

@item
@code{MEMORY} tables use a fixed record length format.

@item
@code{MEMORY} doesn't support @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} columns.

@item
@code{MEMORY} doesn't support @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns.

@item
Prior to MySQL 4.0.2, @code{MEMORY} doesn't support indexes on columns that
can contain @code{NULL} values.

@item
@code{MEMORY} tables are shared between all clients (just like any other
non-@code{TEMPORARY}
table).

@item
The @code{MEMORY} table property that table contents are stored in memory
is one that is shared with internal tables that the server creates on
the fly while processing queries.  However, internal tables also have the
property that the server converts them to on-disk tables automatically if
they become too large.  The size limit is determined by the value of the
@code{tmp_table_size} system variable.

@code{MEMORY} tables are not converted to disk tables.  To ensure that you
don't accidentally do anything foolish, you can set the
@code{max_heap_table_size} system variable to impose a maximum size on
@code{MEMORY} tables.  For individual tables, you can also specify a
@code{MAX_ROWS} table option in the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement.

@item
The server needs enough extra memory to maintain all @code{MEMORY} tables
that are in use at the same time.

@item
To free memory used by a @code{MEMORY} table if you no longer require its
contents, you should execute @code{DELETE} or
@code{TRUNCATE TABLE}, or else remove the table with @code{DROP TABLE}.

@item
If you want to populate a @code{MEMORY} table when the MySQL server starts,
you can use the @code{--init-file} option.  For example, you can put
statements such as @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT} or @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}
into the file to load the table from some persistent data source.
@xref{Server options}.

@item
If you are using replication, the master server's @code{MEMORY} tables
become empty when it is shut down and restarted.  However, a slave is not
aware that these tables have become empty, so it will return out-of-date
content if you select data from them.  Beginning with MySQL 4.0.18, when a
@code{MEMORY} table is used on the master for the first time since the master's
startup, a @code{DELETE FROM} statement is written to the master's binary
log automatically, thus synchronizing the slave to the master again.  Note
that even with this strategy, the slave still has out-of-date data in the
table during the interval between the master's restart and its first use of
the table.  But if you use the @code{--init-file} option to populate the
@code{MEMORY} table on the master at startup, it ensures that the failing
time interval is zero.

@item
The memory needed for one row in a @code{MEMORY} table is calculated using the
following expression:

@example
SUM_OVER_ALL_KEYS(max_length_of_key + sizeof(char*) * 2)
+ ALIGN(length_of_row+1, sizeof(char*))
@end example

@code{ALIGN()} represents a round-up factor to cause the row length to be an
exact multiple of the @code{char} pointer size.
@code{sizeof(char*)} is 4 on 32-bit machines and 8 on 64-bit machines.

Sleepycat Software has provided MySQL with the Berkeley DB transactional
storage engine. This storage engine typically is called @code{BDB} for short.
Support for the @code{BDB} storage engine is included in the MySQL source
distribution starting from version 3.23.34a and is activated in MySQL-Max
binary distributions.

@code{BDB} tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes and are also
capable of @code{COMMIT} and @code{ROLLBACK} operations on transactions.
The MySQL source distribution comes with a @code{BDB} distribution that has a
couple of small patches to make it work more smoothly with MySQL.
You can't use a non-patched @code{BDB} version with MySQL.

We at MySQL AB are working in close cooperation with Sleepycat to keep the
quality of the MySQL/BDB interface high.  (Even though Berkeley DB is in
itself very tested and reliable, the MySQL interface is still considered
gamma quality.  We are improving and optimizing it.)

When it comes to support for any problems involving @code{BDB} tables, we
are committed to helping our users locate the problem and create a
reproducible test case.  Any such test case will be forwarded to Sleepycat,
which in turn will help us find and fix the problem.  As this is a two-stage
operation, any problems with @code{BDB} tables may take a little longer for
us to fix than for other storage engines.  However, we anticipate no
significant difficulties with this procedure because the Berkeley DB code
itself is used in many applications other than MySQL.

start the server with the @code{--skip-bdb} option.


@node BDB install, BDB start, BDB portability, BDB
@subsection Installing @code{BDB}

If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes support for
Berkeley DB, simply follow the usual binary distribution installation
instructions. (MySQL-Max distributions include @code{BDB} support.)

If you build MySQL from source, you can enable @code{BDB} support by running
@code{configure} with the @code{--with-berkeley-db} option in addition
to any other options that you normally use.  Download a distribution for
MySQL 3.23.34 or newer, change location into its top-level directory,
and run this command:

@example
shell> ./configure --with-berkeley-db [other-options]
@end example

For more information, see
@ref{Installing binary},
@ref{mysqld-max, , @code{mysqld-max}}, and
@xref{Installing source}.


@node BDB start, BDB characteristics, BDB install, BDB
@subsection @code{BDB} Startup Options

The following options to @code{mysqld} can be used to change the behavior of
the @code{BDB} storage engine:

@table @code

@item --bdb-home=path

The base directory for @code{BDB} tables.  This should be the same directory
you
use for @code{--datadir}.

@item --bdb-lock-detect=method

The @code{BDB} lock detection method. The option value should be 
@code{DEFAULT}, @code{OLDEST}, @code{RANDOM}, or @code{YOUNGEST}.

@item --bdb-logdir=path

The @code{BDB} log file directory.

@item --bdb-no-recover

Don't start Berkeley DB in recover mode.

@item --bdb-no-sync

Don't synchronously flush the @code{BDB} logs.

@item --bdb-shared-data

Start Berkeley DB in multi-process mode.  (Don't use @code{DB_PRIVATE} when
initializing Berkeley DB.)

@item --bdb-tmpdir=path

The @code{BDB} temporary file directory.

@item --skip-bdb

Disable the @code{BDB} storage engine.

@end table

@xref{Server options}.

The following system variable affects the behavior of
@code{BDB} tables:

@table @code

@item bdb_max_lock

The maximum number of locks you can have active on a @code{BDB} table.

@end table

@xref{Server system variables}.

If you use the @code{--skip-bdb} option, MySQL will not initialize the Berkeley DB
library and this will save a lot of memory.  However, if you use this
option, you cannot use @code{BDB} tables.  If you try to create a @code{BDB}
table, MySQL will create a @code{MyISAM} table instead.

Normally, you should start @code{mysqld} without the @code{--bdb-no-recover}
option if you intend to use @code{BDB} tables.  However, this may give you
problems when you try to start @code{mysqld} if the @code{BDB} log files are
corrupted.
@xref{Starting server}.

With the @code{bdb_max_lock} variable, you can specify the maximum number of
locks that can be active on a @code{BDB} table.  The default is
10,000. You should increase this if errors such as the following occur
when you perform long transactions or when @code{mysqld} has to examine
many rows to execute a query:

@example
bdb: Lock table is out of available locks
Got error 12 from ...
@end example

You may also want to change the @code{binlog_cache_size} and
@code{max_binlog_cache_size} variables if you are using large
multiple-statement transactions.
@xref{Binary log}.


@node BDB characteristics, BDB TODO, BDB start, BDB
@subsection Characteristics of @code{BDB} Tables

Each @code{BDB} table is stored on disk in two files.  The files have
names that begin with the table name and have an extension to indicate the
file type.  An @file{.frm} file stores the table definition, and a @file{.db}
file contains the table data and indexes.

To specify explicitly that you want a @code{BDB} table, indicate that with
an @code{ENGINE} or @code{TYPE} table option:

@example
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = BDB;
CREATE TABLE t (i INT) TYPE = BDB;
@end example

@code{BerkeleyDB} is a synonym for @code{BDB} in the @code{ENGINE} or
@code{TYPE} option.

The @code{BDB} storage engine provides transactional tables. The way you use
these tables depends on the autocommit mode:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you are running with autocommit enabled (which is the default),
changes to @code{BDB} tables are committed immediately and cannot be rolled
back.

@item
If you are running with autocommit disabled, changes do not become
permanent until you execute a @code{COMMIT} statement.  Instead of
committing, you can execute @code{ROLLBACK} to forget the changes.

You can start a transaction with
the @code{BEGIN WORK} statement to suspend autocommit, or with
@code{SET AUTOCOMMIT=0} to disable autocommit explicitly.

@end itemize

@xref{COMMIT,  , @code{COMMIT}}.

The @code{BDB} storage engine has the following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{BDB} tables can have up to 31 indexes per table, 16 columns per index,
and a maximum key size of 1024 bytes (500 bytes before MySQL 4.0).

@item
MySQL requires a @code{PRIMARY KEY} in each @code{BDB} table so that each row
can be uniquely identified.  If you don't create one explicitly,
MySQL creates and maintains a hidden @code{PRIMARY KEY} for
you.  The hidden key has a length of five bytes and is incremented for each
insert attempt.

@item
The @code{PRIMARY KEY} will be faster than any other index, because the
@code{PRIMARY KEY} is stored together with the row data.  The other indexes
are stored as the key data + the @code{PRIMARY KEY}, so it's important to
keep the @code{PRIMARY KEY} as short as possible to save disk space and get
better speed.

This behavior is similar to that of @code{InnoDB}, where shorter primary
keys save space not only in the primary index but in secondary indexes as
well.

@item
If all columns you access in a @code{BDB} table are part of the same index or
part of the primary key, MySQL can execute the query
without having to access the actual row.  In a @code{MyISAM} table, this can
be done only if the columns are part of the same index.

@item
Sequential scanning is slower than for @code{MyISAM} tables because the data
in @code{BDB} tables is stored in B-trees and not in a separate data file.

@item
Key values are not prefix- or suffix-compressed like key values in
@code{MyISAM} tables. In other words, key information takes a little more
space in @code{BDB} tables compared to @code{MyISAM} tables.

@item
There are often holes in the @code{BDB} table to allow you to insert
new rows in the middle of the index tree.  This makes @code{BDB} tables
somewhat larger than @code{MyISAM} tables.

@item
@code{SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name} is slow for @code{BDB} tables, because
no row count is maintained in the table.

@item
The optimizer needs to know the approximate number of rows in the table.
MySQL solves this by counting inserts and maintaining this in a separate
segment in each @code{BDB} table.  If you don't issue a lot of @code{DELETE}
or @code{ROLLBACK} statements, this number should be accurate enough for
the MySQL optimizer. However, MySQL stores the number only on close, so
it may be incorrect if the server terminates unexpectedly. It should not
be fatal even if this number is not 100% correct.  You can update the row
count by using @code{ANALYZE TABLE} or @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}.
See @ref{ANALYZE TABLE,  , @code{ANALYZE TABLE}} and
@ref{OPTIMIZE TABLE,  , @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE}}.

@item
Internal locking in @code{BDB} tables is done at the page level.

@item
@code{LOCK TABLES} works on @code{BDB} tables as with other tables.  If you
don't use @code{LOCK TABLE}, MySQL issues an internal multiple-write lock on
the table (a lock that doesn't block other writers) to ensure that the
table will be properly locked if another thread issues a table lock.

@item
To be able to roll back transactions, the @code{BDB} storage engine
maintains log files.  For maximum performance, you can use the
@code{--bdb-logdir} option to place the @code{BDB} logs on a different disk
than the one where your databases are located.

@item
MySQL performs a checkpoint each time a new @code{BDB} log file is started,
and removes any @code{BDB} log files that are not needed for current
transactions.  You can also use @code{FLUSH LOGS} at any time to checkpoint
the Berkeley DB tables.

For disaster recovery, you should use table backups plus MySQL's binary log.
@xref{Backup}.

@strong{Warning:} If you delete old log files that are still in use,
@code{BDB} will not be able to do recovery at all and you may lose data if
something goes wrong.

@item
Applications must always be prepared to handle cases where
any change of a @code{BDB} table may cause an automatic rollback and any
read may fail with a deadlock error.

@item
If you get full disk with a @code{BDB} table, you will get an error
(probably error 28) and the transaction should roll back.  This contrasts
with @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} tables, for which @code{mysqld} will wait
for enough free disk before continuing.

@end itemize


@node BDB TODO, BDB restrictions, BDB characteristics, BDB
@subsection Things We Need to Fix for @code{BDB}

@itemize @bullet

@item
It's very slow to open many @code{BDB} tables at the same time. If you are
going to use @code{BDB} tables, you should not have a very large table cache
(for example, with a size larger than 256) and you should use the
@code{--no-auto-rehash} option when you use the @code{mysql} client.  We
plan to partly fix this in 4.0.

@item
@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} doesn't yet provide very much information for
@code{BDB}
tables.

@item
Optimize performance.

@item
Change to not use page locks at all for table scanning operations.
@end itemize


@node BDB restrictions, BDB errors, BDB TODO, BDB
@subsection Restrictions on @code{BDB} Tables

The following list indicates restrictions that you must observe when using
@code{BDB} tables:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each
@code{BDB} table stores in the @file{.db} file the path to the file as it
was created.  This was done to be able to detect locks in a multi-user
environment that supports symlinks.  However, the consequence is that
@code{BDB} table files cannot be moved from one database directory to
another.

@item
When making backups of @code{BDB} tables, you must either use
@code{mysqldump} or else make a backup that includes the files for each
@code{BDB} table (the @file{.frm} and @file{.db} files) as well as the
@code{BDB} log files.  The @code{BDB} storage engine stores unfinished
transactions in its log files and requires them to be present when
@code{mysqld} starts.  The @code{BDB} logs are the files in the data
directory with names of the form @file{log.XXXXXXXXXX} (ten digits).

@item
If a column that allows @code{NULL} values has a unique index, only a single
@code{NULL} value is allowed. This differs from other storage engines.

@end itemize

@node BDB errors,  , BDB restrictions, BDB
@subsection Errors That May Occur When Using @code{BDB} Tables

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the following error occurs when you start @code{mysqld}, it means that
the new @code{BDB} version doesn't support the old log file format:

@example
bdb:  Ignoring log file: .../log.XXXXXXXXXX:
unsupported log version #
@end example

In this case, you must delete all @code{BDB} logs from your data directory
(the files with names that have the format @file{log.XXXXXXXXXX}) and
restart @code{mysqld}.  We also recommend that you then use @code{mysqldump
--opt} to dump your @code{BDB} tables, drop the tables, and restore them
from the dump file.

@item
If autocommit mode is disabled and you drop a @code{BDB} table that
is referenced in another transaction, you may get error messages of the
following form in your MySQL error log:

@example
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  Missing log fileid entry
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  txn_abort: Log undo failed for LSN:
                       1 3644744: Invalid
@end example

This is not fatal, but until the problem is fixed, we recommend that you
not drop @code{BDB} tables except while autocommit mode is enabled.  (The
fix is not trivial.)

@end itemize

@node ISAM,  , BDB, Table types
@section The @code{ISAM} Storage Engine

@cindex @code{ISAM} storage engine
@cindex @code{ISAM} table type
@cindex tables, ISAM

The original storage engine in MySQL was the @code{ISAM} engine. It was the
only storage engine available until MySQL 3.23, when the improved
@code{MyISAM} engine was introduced as the default. @code{ISAM} now is
deprecated.  As of MySQL 4.1, it's included in the source but not enabled in
binary distributions.  It will disappear in MySQL 5.0.
Embedded MySQL server versions do not support @code{ISAM} tables by default.

Due to the deprecated status of @code{ISAM}, and because @code{MyISAM} is
an improvement over @code{ISAM}, you are advised to convert any remaining
@code{ISAM} tables to @code{MySAM} as soon as possible.  To convert an
@code{ISAM} table to a @code{MyISAM} table, use an @code{ALTER TABLE}
statement:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE = MYISAM;
@end example

For more information about @code{MyISAM}, see
@ref{MyISAM,  , @code{MyISAM}}.

Each @code{ISAM} table is stored on disk in three files.  The files have
names that begin with the table name and have an extension to indicate the
file type.  An @file{.frm} file stores the table definition.  The data file
has an @file{.ISD} extension.  The index file has an @file{.ISM}
extension.

@code{ISAM} uses B-tree indexes.

You can check or repair @code{ISAM} tables with the @code{isamchk} utility.
@xref{Crash recovery}.

@code{ISAM} has the following properties:

@itemize @bullet
@item Compressed and fixed-length keys
@item Fixed and dynamic record length
@item 16 indexes per table, with 16 key parts per key
@item Maximum key length 256 bytes (default)
@item Data values are stored in machine format; this is fast, but machine/OS dependent
@end itemize

Many of the properties of @code{MyISAM} tables are also true for @code{ISAM}
tables. However, there are also many differences. The following list
describes some of the ways that @code{ISAM} is distinct from @code{MyISAM}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Not binary portable across OS/platforms.

@item
Can't handle tables larger than 4GB.

@item
Only supports prefix compression on strings.

@item
Smaller (more restrictive) key limits.

@item
Dynamic tables become more fragmented.

@item
Doesn't support @code{MERGE} tables.

@item
Tables are checked and repaired with @code{isamchk} rather than with
@code{myisamchk}.

@item
Tables are compressed with @code{pack_isam} rather than with @code{myisampack}.

@item
Cannot be used with the @code{BACKUP TABLE} or  @code{RESTORE TABLE}
backup-related statements.

@item
Cannot be used with the @code{CHECK TABLE}, @code{REPAIR TABLE}, @code{OPTIMIZE
TABLE}, or @code{ANALYZE TABLE} table-maintenance statements.

@item
No support for full-text searching or spatial data types.

@item
No support for multiple character sets per table.

@item
Indexes cannot be assigned to specific key caches.

@cindex InnoDB
@cindex transactions, support
@cindex transaction-safe tables
@cindex ACID

@code{InnoDB} provides MySQL with a transaction-safe (@code{ACID} compliant)
storage engine with commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities.
@code{InnoDB} does locking on the row level and also provides an Oracle-style
consistent
non-locking read in @code{SELECT} statements. These features increase
multi-user concurrency and performance. There is no need for
lock escalation in @code{InnoDB}
because row-level locks in @code{InnoDB} fit in very little space.
@code{InnoDB} also supports @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraints.
In SQL queries you can freely mix @code{InnoDB} type tables with other
table types of MySQL, even within the same query.

@code{InnoDB} has been designed for maximum performance when processing
large data volumes. Its CPU efficiency is probably not
matched by any other disk-based relational database engine.

Fully integrated with MySQL Server, the @code{InnoDB} storage engine maintains
its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main memory.
@code{InnoDB} stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which
may consist of several files (or raw disk partitions).
This is different from, for example,
@code{MyISAM} tables where each table is stored using separate files.
@code{InnoDB} tables can be of any size even on operating
systems where file size is limited to 2GB.

@code{InnoDB} is included in binary distributions by default as of MySQL 4.0.
For information about @code{InnoDB} support in MySQL 3.23, see
@ref{InnoDB in MySQL 3.23}.

@code{InnoDB} is used in production at numerous
large database sites requiring high performance.
The famous Internet news site Slashdot.org runs on @code{InnoDB}.
Mytrix, Inc. stores over 1TB of data in @code{InnoDB},
and another site handles an average
load of 800 inserts/updates per second in @code{InnoDB}.

@code{InnoDB} is published under the same GNU @code{GPL} License Version 2
(of June 1991) as MySQL. If you distribute MySQL/InnoDB, and your application
does not satisfy the provisions of the GPL license, you must purchase a
commercial
@strong{MySQL Pro} license from @uref{https://order.mysql.com/?sub=pg&pg_no=1}.

@section @code{InnoDB} in MySQL 3.23

Beginning with MySQL 4.0, @code{InnoDB} is enabled by default, so
the following information applies only to MySQL 3.23.

@code{InnoDB} tables are included in the MySQL source distribution
starting from 3.23.34a and are activated in the MySQL-Max
binaries of the 3.23 series.
For Windows, the MySQL-Max binaries are included in the
standard distribution.

If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes support for
@code{InnoDB}, simply follow the instructions of the MySQL manual for
installing a binary version of MySQL. If you already have MySQL 3.23
installed, the simplest way to install MySQL-Max is to replace the
executable @code{mysqld} server with the corresponding executable from the
MySQL-Max distribution.  MySQL and MySQL-Max differ only in the server
executable.
See @ref{Installing binary} and
@ref{mysqld-max, , @code{mysqld-max}}.

To compile the MySQL source code with @code{InnoDB} support,
download MySQL 3.23.34a or newer from
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/}
and configure MySQL with the
@code{--with-innodb} option. 
@xref{Installing source}.

To use @code{InnoDB} tables with MySQL 3.23, you must specify configuration
parameters in the @code{[mysqld]} section of the @file{my.cnf} option file.
On Windows, you can use @file{my.ini} instead. If you do not configure
@code{InnoDB} in the option file, @code{InnoDB} will not start. (From MySQL
4.0 on, @code{InnoDB} uses default parameters if you do not specify any.
However, it is still recommended that to get best performance, you should use
parameters appropriate for your system, as discussed in
@ref{InnoDB configuration,  , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.)

In MySQL 3.23, you must specify at the minimum an @code{innodb_data_file_path}
value to configure the @code{InnoDB} data files. For example, to configure
@code{InnoDB} to use a single 10MB auto-extending data file, place the
following setting in the @code{[mysqld]} section of your option file:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:10M:autoextend
@end example

@code{InnoDB} will create the @file{ibdata1} file in the MySQL data directory
by default. To specify the location explicitly, specify an
@code{innodb_data_home_dir} setting.
@xref{InnoDB configuration,  , @code{InnoDB} configuration}.


@node InnoDB configuration, InnoDB start, InnoDB in MySQL 3.23, InnoDB
@section @code{InnoDB} Configuration

To enable @code{InnoDB} tables in MySQL 3.23, see
@ref{InnoDB in MySQL 3.23}.

From MySQL 4.0 on, the @code{InnoDB} storage engine is enabled
by default. If you don't want to use @code{InnoDB} tables, you can
add the @code{skip-innodb} option to your MySQL option file.

Two important disk-based resources managed by the @code{InnoDB} storage
engine are its tablespace data files and its log files.

If you specify no @code{InnoDB} configuration options, MySQL 4.0 and
above creates an auto-extending 10MB data file named @file{ibdata1} and
two 5MB log files named @file{ib_logfile0} and @file{ib_logfile1} in the MySQL data directory.
(In MySQL 4.0.0 and 4.0.1, the data file is 64MB and not auto-extending.)
In MySQL 3.23, @code{InnoDB} will not start if you provide no configuration
options.

@strong{Note:} To get good performance, you should explicitly provide
@code{InnoDB} parameters as discussed in the following examples. Naturally,
you should edit the settings to suit your hardware and requirements.

To set up the @code{InnoDB} tablespace files, use the
@code{innodb_data_file_path} option in the @code{[mysqld]} section of the
@file{my.cnf} option file.  On Windows, you can use @file{my.ini} instead.
The value of @code{innodb_data_file_path} should be a list of one or more
data file specifications.  If you name more than one data file, separate them
by semicolon (@samp{;}) characters:

@example
innodb_data_file_path=datafile_spec1[;datafile_spec2]...
@end example

For example, a setting that explicitly creates a tablespace having the
same characteristics as the MySQL 4.0 default is as follows:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:10M:autoextend
@end example

This setting configures a single 10MB data file named @file{ibdata1} that is
auto-extending.  No location for the file is given, so the default is the
MySQL data directory.

Sizes are specified using @code{M} or @code{G} suffix letters to indicate
units of MB or GB.

A tablespace containing a fixed-size 50MB data file named @file{ibdata1} and
a 50MB auto-extending file named @code{ibdata2} in the data directory can be
configured like this:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:50M;ibdata2:50M:autoextend
@end example

The full syntax for a data file specification includes the filename, its size,
and several optional attributes:

@example
file_name:file_size[:autoextend[:max:max_file_size]]
@end example

The @code{autoextend} attribute and those following can be used only for the
last data file in the @code{innodb_data_file_path} line.  @code{autoextend}
is available starting from MySQL 3.23.50 and 4.0.2.

If you specify the @code{autoextend} option for the last data file,
@code{InnoDB} extends the data file if it runs out of free space in the
tablespace. The increment is 8MB at a time.

If the disk becomes full, you might want to add another data file on
another disk. Instructions for reconfiguring an existing tablespace are
given in @ref{Adding and removing}.

@code{InnoDB} is not aware of the maximum file size, so
be cautious on filesystems where the maximum file size is 2GB.
To specify a maximum size for an auto-extending data file, use the @code{max}
attribute. The following configuration allows @file{ibdata1} to grow up to a
limit of 500MB:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:10M:autoextend:max:500M
@end example

@code{InnoDB} creates tablespace files in the MySQL data directory by default.
To specify a location explicitly, use the @code{innodb_data_home_dir} option.
For example, to use two files named @file{ibdata1} and @file{ibdata2} but
create them in the @file{/ibdata} directory, configure @code{InnoDB} like this:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_home_dir = /ibdata
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:50M;ibdata2:50M:autoextend
@end example

@strong{Note:} @code{InnoDB} does not create directories, so make sure that
the @file{/ibdata} directory exists before you start the server.  This is
also true of any log file directories that you configure.  Use the Unix or
DOS @code{mkdir} command to create any necessary directories.

@code{InnoDB} forms the directory path for each data file by textually
concatenating the value of @code{innodb_data_home_dir} to the data file name,
adding a slash or backslash between if needed.  If the
@code{innodb_data_home_dir} option is not mentioned in @file{my.cnf} at all,
the default value is the ``dot'' directory @file{./}, which means the MySQL
data directory.

If you specify @code{innodb_data_home_dir} as an empty string, you can
specify absolute paths for the data files listed in the
@code{innodb_data_file_path} value. The following example is equivalent to
the preceding one:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path=/ibdata/ibdata1:50M;/ibdata/ibdata2:50M:autoextend
@end example

@strong{A simple @file{my.cnf} example.}
Suppose that you have a computer
with 128MB RAM and one hard disk. The following example shows
possible configuration parameters in @file{my.cnf} or
@file{my.ini} for @code{InnoDB}. The example assumes the use of
MySQL-Max 3.23.50 or later or MySQL 4.0.2 or later because it makes use of the
@code{autoextend} attribute.

This example suits most users, both on Unix and Windows,
who do not want to distribute @code{InnoDB} data files and
log files on several disks. It creates an
auto-extending data file @file{ibdata1} and two @code{InnoDB} log files
@file{ib_logfile0} and @file{ib_logfile1} in the
MySQL data directory.  Also, the small archived @code{InnoDB} log file
@file{ib_arch_log_0000000000} that @code{InnoDB} creates automatically ends
up in the data directory.

@example
[mysqld]
# You can write your other MySQL server options here
# ...
# Data files must be able to hold your data and indexes.
# Make sure that you have enough free disk space.
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend
#
# Set buffer pool size to 50-80% of your computer's memory
set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=70M
set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=10M
#
# Set the log file size to about 25% of the buffer pool size
set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=20M
set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
#
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
@end example

Make sure that the MySQL server has the proper access rights to create files
in the data directory. More generally, the server must have access rights in
any directory where it needs to create data files or log files.

Note that data files must be less than 2GB in some filesystems.
The combined size of the log files must be less than 4GB. The combined
size of data files must be at least 10MB.

When you create an @code{InnoDB} tablespace for the first time, it is
best that you start the MySQL server from the command prompt.
@code{InnoDB} will then print the information about the database
creation to the screen, so you can see what is happening.
For example, on Windows, if @code{mysqld-max} is located in
@file{C:\mysql\bin}, you can start it like this:

@example
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max --console
@end example

If you do not send server output to the screen, check the server's error log
to see what @code{InnoDB} prints during the startup process.

See @ref{InnoDB init,  , @code{InnoDB} init} for an example of what the
information displayed by @code{InnoDB} should look like.

@strong{Where to specify options on Windows?}
The rules for option files on Windows are as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Only one of @file{my.cnf} or @file{my.ini} should be created.

@item
The @file{my.cnf} file should be placed in the root
directory of the @file{C:} drive.

@item
The @file{my.ini} file should be placed in the @code{WINDIR} directory; for
example, @file{C:\WINDOWS} or @file{C:\WINNT}. You can use the @code{SET}
command at the command prompt in a console window to print the value of
@code{WINDIR}:

@example
C:\> SET WINDIR
windir=C:\WINNT
@end example

@item
If your PC uses a boot loader where the @file{C:} drive
is not the boot drive, your only option is to use the @file{my.ini} file.

@end itemize

@strong{Where to specify options on Unix?}
On Unix, @code{mysqld} reads options from the following files, if they exist,
in the following order: 

@c Note: Do not remove blank lines following the @item lines

@itemize @bullet

@item @file{/etc/my.cnf}

Global options.  

@item @file{COMPILATION_DATADIR/my.cnf}

Server-specific options.  

@item @file{defaults-extra-file}

The file specified with the @code{--defaults-extra-file} option.

@item @file{~/.my.cnf}

User-specific options.

@end itemize

@code{COMPILATION_DATADIR} is the MySQL data directory that was
specified as a @code{configure} option when @code{mysqld}
was compiled
(typically @file{/usr/local/mysql/data} for a binary installation or @file{/usr/local/var} for a source installation).

If you want to make sure that @code{mysqld} reads options only from a
specific file, you can use the @code{--defaults-option} as the first option
on the command line when starting the server:

@example
mysqld --defaults-file=your_path_to_my_cnf
@end example

@strong{An advanced @file{my.cnf} example.}
Suppose that you have a Linux computer
with 2GB RAM and three 60GB hard disks
(at directory paths @file{/}, @file{/dr2} and
@file{/dr3}). The following example shows possible
configuration parameters in @file{my.cnf} for @code{InnoDB}. 

@example
[mysqld]
# You can write your other MySQL server options here
# ...
innodb_data_home_dir =
#
# Data files must be able to hold your data and indexes
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:2000M;/dr2/ibdata/ibdata2:2000M:autoextend
#
# Set buffer pool size to 50-80% of your computer's memory,
# but make sure on Linux x86 total memory usage is < 2GB
set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G
set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=20M
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /dr3/iblogs
#
# innodb_log_arch_dir must be the same as innodb_log_group_home_dir
# (starting from 4.0.6, you can omit it)
innodb_log_arch_dir = /dr3/iblogs
set-variable = innodb_log_files_in_group=2
#
# Set the log file size to about 25% of the buffer pool size
set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=250M
set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
#
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
set-variable = innodb_lock_wait_timeout=50
#
# Uncomment the next lines if you want to use them
#innodb_flush_method=fdatasync
#set-variable = innodb_thread_concurrency=5
@end example

Note that the example places the two data files on different disks.
@code{InnoDB} will fill the tablespace beginning with the first data file.
In some cases, it will
improve the performance of the database if all data is not placed
on the same physical disk. Putting log files on a different disk from
data is very often beneficial for performance.
You can also use raw disk partitions (raw devices)
as @code{InnoDB} data files, which may speed up I/O. @xref{InnoDB Raw Devices}.

@strong{Warning:} On GNU/Linux x86, you must be careful not to set memory
usage too high.  @code{glibc} will allow the process heap to grow over
thread stacks, which will crash your server. It is a risk if the value of
the following expression is close to or exceeds 2GB:

@example
innodb_buffer_pool_size
+ key_buffer_size
+ max_connections*(sort_buffer_size+read_buffer_size+binlog_cache_size)
+ max_connections*2MB
@end example

Each thread will use a stack (often 2MB, but only 256KB in MySQL AB binaries)
and in the worst case also uses @code{sort_buffer_size + read_buffer_size}
additional memory.

Starting from MySQL 4.1, you can use up to 64GB of physical memory in 32-bit
Windows.  See the description for @code{innodb_buffer_pool_awe_mem_mb} in
@ref{InnoDB start,  , @code{InnoDB} start}.

@strong{How to tune other @code{mysqld} server parameters?}
The following values are typical and suit most users:

@example
[mysqld]
skip-external-locking
set-variable = max_connections=200
set-variable = read_buffer_size=1M
set-variable = sort_buffer_size=1M
#
# Set key_buffer to 5 - 50% of your RAM depending on how much
# you use MyISAM tables, but keep key_buffer_size + InnoDB
# buffer pool size < 80% of your RAM
set-variable = key_buffer_size=...
@end example


@node InnoDB start, InnoDB init, InnoDB configuration, InnoDB
@section @code{InnoDB} Startup Options

@c TODO: Have separate lists for options and variables?

This section describes the @code{InnoDB}-related server options.  In MySQL
4.0 and up, all of them can be specified in @code{--opt_name=value} form on
the command line or in option files.  Before MySQL 4.0, numeric options
should be specified using @code{--set-variable=opt_name=value} or @code{-O
opt_name=value} syntax.

@c TODO: these should be listed using --opt_name=type_of_value syntax

@table @code

@item innodb_additional_mem_pool_size
The size of a memory pool @code{InnoDB} uses to store data dictionary
information and other internal data structures.  The more tables you have in
your application, the more memory you will need to allocate here. If
@code{InnoDB} runs out of memory in this pool, it will start to allocate
memory from the operating system, and write warning messages to the MySQL
error log. The default value is 1MB.

@item innodb_buffer_pool_awe_mem_mb
The size of the buffer pool (in MB), if it is placed in the AWE memory of
32-bit Windows. Available from 4.1.0 and relevant only in 32-bit Windows. If
your 32-bit Windows operating system supports more than 4GB memory, so-called ``Address
Windowing Extensions,'' you can allocate the @code{InnoDB} buffer pool into the
AWE physical memory using this parameter. The maximum possible value for this
is 64000. If this parameter is specified, @code{innodb_buffer_pool_size}
is the window in the 32-bit address space of @code{mysqld} where @code{InnoDB}
maps that AWE memory. A good value for @code{innodb_buffer_pool_size}
is 500MB.

@item innodb_buffer_pool_size
The size of the memory buffer @code{InnoDB} uses to cache data and indexes
of its tables.  The larger you set this value, the less disk I/O is needed
to access data in tables. On a dedicated database server, you may set this
to up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. However, do not set it
too large because competition for the physical memory might cause paging
in the operating system.

@item innodb_data_file_path
The paths to individual data files and their sizes. The full directory path
to each data file is acquired by concatenating @code{innodb_data_home_dir}
to each path specified here. The file sizes are specified in megabytes
or gigabytes (1024MB) by appending @code{M} or @code{G} to the size
value.  The sum of the sizes of the files must be at least 10MB. On some
operating systems, files must be less than 2GB. If you do not specify
@code{innodb_data_file_path}, the default behavior starting from 4.0 is to
create a single 10MB auto-extending data file named @file{ibdata1}. Starting
from 3.23.44, you can set the file size bigger than 4GB on those operating
systems that support big files. You can also use raw disk partitions as
data files. @xref{InnoDB Raw Devices}.

@item innodb_data_home_dir
The common part of the directory path for all @code{InnoDB} data files. If
you do not set this value, the default is the MySQL data directory. You can
specify this also as an empty string, in which case you can use absolute
file paths in @code{innodb_data_file_path}.

@item innodb_fast_shutdown
By default, @code{InnoDB} does a full purge and an insert buffer merge
before a shutdown. These operations can take minutes, or even hours in extreme
cases.  If you set this parameter to 1, @code{InnoDB}
skips these operations at shutdown. This option is available starting from
MySQL 3.23.44 and 4.0.1. Its default value is 1 starting from 3.23.50.

@item innodb_file_io_threads
The number of file I/O threads in @code{InnoDB}. Normally this should be
left at the default value of 4, but disk I/O on Windows may benefit from
a larger number. On Unix, increasing the number has no effect; @code{InnoDB}
always uses the default value.
This option is available as of MySQL 3.23.37.

@item innodb_file_per_table
This option causes @code{InnoDB} to create each new table
using its own @file{.ibd} file for storing data and indexes, rather than in
the shared tablespace. @xref{Multiple tablespaces}.
This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

@item innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit
Normally you set this to 1, meaning that at a transaction commit, the log
is flushed to disk, and the modifications made by the transaction become
permanent and survive a database crash. If you are willing to compromise
this safety, and you are running small transactions, you may set this to
0 or 2 to reduce disk I/O to the logs. A value of 0 means that the log is
only written to the log file and the log file flushed to disk approximately
once per second. A value of 2 means the log is written to the log file at
each commit, but the log file is only flushed to disk approximately once
per second.  The default value is 1 (prior to MySQL 4.0.13, the default 0).

@item innodb_flush_method
This option is relevant only on Unix systems. If set to @code{fdatasync},
@code{InnoDB} uses @code{fsync()} to flush both the data and log
files. If set to @code{O_DSYNC}, @code{InnoDB} uses @code{O_SYNC}
to open and flush the log files, but uses @code{fsync()} to flush the
data files. If @code{O_DIRECT} is specified (available on some GNU/Linux
versions  starting from MySQL 4.0.14), @code{InnoDB} uses @code{O_DIRECT}
to open the data files, and uses @code{fsync()} to flush both the data
and log files. Note that @code{InnoDB} does not use @code{fdatasync} or
@code{O_DSYNC} by default because there have been problems with them on
many Unix flavors.  This option is available as of MySQL 3.23.40.

@item innodb_force_recovery
Warning: This option should be defined only in an emergency situation when
you want to dump your tables from a corrupt database! Possible values are
from 1 to 6. The meanings of these values are described in @ref{Forcing
recovery}. As a safety measure, @code{InnoDB} prevents a user from modifying
data when this option is greater than 0. This option is available starting
from MySQL 3.23.44.

@item innodb_lock_wait_timeout
The timeout in seconds an @code{InnoDB} transaction may wait for a lock
before being rolled back.  @code{InnoDB} automatically detects transaction
deadlocks in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you
use the @code{LOCK TABLES} statement, or other transaction-safe storage
engines than @code{InnoDB} in the same transaction, a deadlock may arise
that @code{InnoDB} cannot notice. In cases like this, the timeout is useful
to resolve the situation. The default is 50 seconds.

@item innodb_log_arch_dir
The directory where fully written log files would be archived if we used log
archiving.  The value of this parameter should currently be set the same as
@code{innodb_log_group_home_dir}. Starting from MySQL 4.0.6, you may omit
this option.

@item innodb_log_archive
This value should currently be set to 0.  Because recovery from a backup
is done by MySQL using its own log files, there is currently no need to
archive @code{InnoDB} log files. The default for this option is 0.

@item innodb_log_buffer_size
The size of the buffer that @code{InnoDB} uses to write to the log files
on disk.  Sensible values range from 1MB to 8MB.  The default is 1MB. A large
log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need to write the log
to disk before the transactions commit. Thus, if you have big transactions,
making the log buffer larger will save disk I/O.

@item innodb_log_file_size
The size of each log file in a log group. The combined size of
log files must be less than 4GB on 32-bit computers. The default is 5MB.
Sensible values range from 1MB to 1/@code{N}-th of the size of the buffer pool,
below, where @code{N} is the number of log files in the group. The larger
the value, the less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer
pool, saving disk I/O. But larger log files also mean that recovery will
be slower in case of a crash.

@item innodb_log_files_in_group
The number of log files in the log group. @code{InnoDB} writes to the
files in a circular fashion. The default is 2 (recommended).

@item innodb_log_group_home_dir
The directory path to the @code{InnoDB} log files.  It must have the same
value as @code{innodb_log_arch_dir}.  If you do not specify any @code{InnoDB}
log parameters, the default is to create two 5MB files names @file{ib_logfile0}
and @file{ib_logfile1} in the MySQL data directory.

@item innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct
This is an integer in the range from 0 to 100. The default is 90. The main
thread in @code{InnoDB} tries to flush pages from the buffer pool so that
at most this many percent of pages may not yet flushed been flushed at
any particular time. Available starting from 4.0.13 and 4.1.1. If you have the
@code{SUPER} privilege, this percentage can be changed while the server is
running:

@example
SET GLOBAL innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = value;
@end example

@item innodb_mirrored_log_groups
The number of identical copies of log groups we keep for the
database. Currently this should be set to 1.

@item innodb_open_files
This option is relevant only if you use multiple tablespaces in
@code{InnoDB}. It specifies the maximum number of @file{.ibd} files that
@code{InnoDB} can keep open at one time. The minimum value is 10. The
default is 300.  This option is available as of MySQL 4.1.1.

The file descriptors used for @file{.ibd} files are for @code{InnoDB} only.
They are independent of those specified by the @code{--open-files-limit}
server option, and do not affect the operation of the table cache.

@item innodb_thread_concurrency
@code{InnoDB} tries to keep the number of operating system threads
concurrently inside @code{InnoDB} less than or equal to the limit given
by this parameter. The default value is 8. If you have low performance
and @code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} reveals many threads waiting for semaphores,
you may have thread thrashing and should try setting this parameter lower
or higher.  If you have a computer with many processors and disks, you
can try setting the value higher to better utilize the resources of you
computer. A recommended value is the sum of the number of processors and
disks your system has.  A value of 500 or greater disables the concurrency
checking.  This option is available starting from MySQL 3.23.44 and 4.0.1.

@node InnoDB init, Using InnoDB tables, InnoDB start, InnoDB
@section Creating the @code{InnoDB} Tablespace

Suppose that you have installed MySQL and have edited your option file so
that it contains the necessary @code{InnoDB} configuration parameters.
Before starting MySQL, you should verify that the directories you have
specified for @code{InnoDB} data files and log files exist and that the
MySQL server has access rights to those directories. @code{InnoDB} cannot
create directories, only files. Check also that you have enough disk space
for the data and log files.

It is best to run the MySQL server @code{mysqld} from the command prompt
when you create an @code{InnoDB} database, not from the @code{mysqld_safe}
wrapper or as a Windows service. When you run from a command prompt you
see what @code{mysqld} prints and what is happening. On Unix, just invoke
@code{mysqld}. On Windows, use the @code{--console} option.

When you start the MySQL server after initially configuring @code{InnoDB} in
your option file, @code{InnoDB} creates your
data files and log files. @code{InnoDB} will print something like the following:

@example
InnoDB: The first specified datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata1
did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata1 size to 134217728
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 size to 262144000
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 size
to 5242880
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 did not exist:
new to be created
InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 size
to 5242880
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer not found: creating new
InnoDB: Doublewrite buffer created
InnoDB: Creating foreign key constraint system tables
InnoDB: Foreign key constraint system tables created
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
@end example

A new @code{InnoDB} database has now been created. You can connect to the MySQL
server with the usual MySQL client programs like @code{mysql}.
When you shut down the MySQL server with @code{mysqladmin shutdown},
the output will be like the following:

@example
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Normal shutdown
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Shutdown Complete
InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
InnoDB: Shutdown completed
@end example

You can now look at the data file and log directories and you
will see the files created. The log directory will also contain
a small file named @file{ib_arch_log_0000000000}. That file
resulted from the database creation, after which @code{InnoDB} switched off
log archiving.
When MySQL is started again, the data files and log files will already have
been created, so the output will be much briefer:

@example
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
@end example

@node Error creating InnoDB,  , InnoDB init, InnoDB init
@subsection Dealing with @code{InnoDB} Initialization Problems

If @code{InnoDB} prints an operating system error in a file operation,
usually the problem is one of the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item You did not create the @code{InnoDB} data file or log directories.
@item @code{mysqld} does not have access rights to create files in those
directories.
@item @code{mysqld} does not read the proper @file{my.cnf} or @file{my.ini}
option file, and consequently does not see the options you specified.
@item The disk is full or a disk quota is exceeded.
@item You have created a subdirectory whose name is equal to a data file
you specified.
@item There is a syntax error in @code{innodb_data_home_dir}
or @code{innodb_data_file_path}.
@end itemize

If something goes wrong when @code{InnoDB} attempts to initialize
its tablespace or its log files, you should delete all files created
by @code{InnoDB}. This means all data files, all log files, and the small
archived log file. In case you already created some @code{InnoDB} tables,
delete the corresponding @file{.frm} files for these tables (and any
@file{.ibd} files if you are using multiple tablespaces) from the
MySQL database directories as well. Then you can try the @code{InnoDB}
database creation again.  It is best to start the MySQL server from a
command prompt so that you see what is happening.


@node Using InnoDB tables, Adding and removing, InnoDB init, InnoDB
@section Creating @code{InnoDB} Tables

Suppose that you have started the MySQL client with the command @code{mysql test}.
To create an @code{InnoDB} table, you must specify and @code{ENGINE = InnoDB}
or @code{TYPE = InnoDB} option in the table creation SQL statement:

@example
CREATE TABLE customers (a INT, b CHAR (20), INDEX (a)) ENGINE=InnoDB;
CREATE TABLE customers (a INT, b CHAR (20), INDEX (a)) TYPE=InnoDB;
@end example

The SQL statement creates a table and an index on column @code{a} in the
@code{InnoDB} tablespace that consists of the data files you specified in
@file{my.cnf}. In addition, MySQL creates a file @file{customers.frm}
in the @file{test} directory under the MySQL database directory.
Internally, @code{InnoDB} adds to its own data dictionary an entry for
table @code{'test/customers'}. This means you can create a table of the same
name @code{customers} in some other database, and the table names will
not collide inside @code{InnoDB}.

You can query the amount of free space in the @code{InnoDB} tablespace
by issuing a @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} statement for any @code{InnoDB} table.
The amount of free
space in the tablespace appears in the @code{Comment} section in the
output of @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS}. An example:

@example
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM test LIKE 'customers'
@end example

Note that the statistics @code{SHOW} gives about @code{InnoDB} tables
are only approximate. They are used in SQL optimization.  Table and index
reserved sizes in bytes are accurate, though.

@subsection How to Use Transactions in @code{InnoDB} with Different APIs

By default, each client that connects to the MySQL server begins with autocommit
mode enabled, which automatically commits every SQL statement you run.
To use multiple-statement transactions, you can switch autocommit off
with the SQL statement @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0} and use @code{COMMIT}
and @code{ROLLBACK} to commit or roll back your transaction.
If you want to leave autocommit on, you can enclose your transactions
between @code{START TRANSACTION} and @code{COMMIT} or @code{ROLLBACK}.
Before MySQL 4.0.11, you have to use the keyword @code{BEGIN}
instead of @code{START TRANSACTION}. The following example shows two
transactions. The first is committed and the second is rolled back.

@example
shell> mysql test
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5 to server version: 3.23.50-log
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

In APIs like PHP, Perl DBI/DBD, JDBC, ODBC, or the standard C call
interface of MySQL, you can send transaction control statements such as
@code{COMMIT} to the MySQL server as strings just like any other
SQL statements such as @code{SELECT} or @code{INSERT}.
Some APIs also offer separate special transaction commit and rollback functions
or methods.

@subsection Converting @code{MyISAM} Tables to @code{InnoDB}

Important: You should not convert MySQL system tables in the @code{mysql}
database (such as @code{user} or @code{host}) to the @code{InnoDB} type. The
system tables must always be of the @code{MyISAM} type.

If you want all your (non-system) tables to be created as @code{InnoDB}
tables, you can, starting from the MySQL 3.23.43, add the line
@code{default-table-type=innodb} to the @code{[mysqld]} section of
your @file{my.cnf} or @file{my.ini} file.

@code{InnoDB} does not have a special optimization for separate index
creation the way the @code{MyISAM} storage engine does.  Therefore, it does
not pay to export and import the table and create indexes afterward.
The fastest way to alter a table to @code{InnoDB} is to do the inserts
directly to an @code{InnoDB} table. That is, use @code{ALTER TABLE
... TYPE=INNODB}, or create an empty @code{InnoDB} table with identical
definitions and insert the rows with @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT *
FROM ...}.

If you have @code{UNIQUE} constraints on secondary keys, starting from
MySQL 3.23.52, you can speed up a table import by turning off the uniqueness
checks temporarily during the import session: @code{SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0;}
For big tables this saves a lot of disk I/O because @code{InnoDB} can then
use its insert buffer to write secondary index records in a batch.

To get better control over the insertion process, it might be good to insert
big tables in pieces:

@example
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable
   WHERE yourkey > something AND yourkey <= somethingelse;
@end example

After all data has been inserted, you can rename the tables.

During the conversion of big tables, you should increase the size of the
@code{InnoDB} buffer pool to reduce disk I/O. Do not use more than 80% of the
physical memory, though. You can also increase the sizes of the @code{InnoDB}
log files and the log files.

Make sure that you do not fill up the tablespace: @code{InnoDB} tables require
a lot more disk space than @code{MyISAM} tables. If an @code{ALTER TABLE}
runs out of space, it will start a rollback, and that can take hours if
it is disk-bound.  For inserts, @code{InnoDB} uses the insert buffer to
merge secondary index records to indexes in batches. That saves a lot of
disk I/O. In rollback, no such mechanism is used, and the rollback can take
30 times longer than the insertion.

In the case of a runaway rollback, if you do not have valuable data in your
database, it may be advisable to kill the database process rather than wait
for millions of disk I/O operations to complete.
For the complete procedure, see @ref{Forcing recovery}.


@node InnoDB auto-increment column, InnoDB foreign key constraints, Converting tables to InnoDB, Using InnoDB tables
@subsection How an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} Column Works in @code{InnoDB}

If you specify an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column for a table, the @code{InnoDB}
table handle in the data dictionary will contain a special counter called
the auto-increment counter that is used in assigning new values for the
column. The auto-increment counter is stored only in main memory, not
on disk.

@code{InnoDB} uses the following algorithm to initialize the auto-increment
counter for a table @code{T} that contains an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column
named @code{ai_col}: After a server startup, when a user first does an insert
to a table @code{T}, @code{InnoDB} executes the equivalent of this statement:

@example
SELECT MAX(ai_col) FROM T FOR UPDATE;
@end example

The value retrieved by the statement is incremented by one and assigned to
the column and the auto-increment counter of the table. If the table is
empty, the value @code{1} is assigned. If the auto-increment counter is not
initialized and the user invokes a @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} statement that
displays output for the table @code{T}, the counter is initialized (but not
incremented) and stored for use by later inserts.
Note that in this initialization
we do a normal exclusive-locking read on the table and the lock lasts to the end
of the transaction.

@code{InnoDB} follows the same procedure for initializing the auto-increment
counter for a freshly created table.

Note that if the user specifies @code{NULL} or @code{0} for the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column in an @code{INSERT}, @code{InnoDB} treats the
row as if the value had not been specified and generates a new value for it.

After the auto-increment counter has been initialized, if a user inserts
a row that explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is
bigger than the current counter value, the counter is set to the specified
column value. If the user does not explicitly specify a value, @code{InnoDB}
increments the counter by one and assigns the new value to the column.

When accessing the auto-increment counter, @code{InnoDB} uses a special table
level @code{AUTO-INC} lock that it keeps to the end of the current SQL
statement, not to the end of the transaction.
The special lock release strategy was introduced to improve concurrency
for inserts into a table containing an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column. Two
transactions cannot have the @code{AUTO-INC} lock on the same table
simultaneously.

Note that you may see gaps in the sequence of values assigned to the
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column if you roll back transactions that have gotten
numbers from the counter.

The behavior of the auto-increment mechanism is not defined if a user
assigns a negative value to the column or if the value becomes bigger
than the maximum integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.


@node InnoDB foreign key constraints, InnoDB and MySQL Replication, InnoDB auto-increment column, Using InnoDB tables
@subsection @code{FOREIGN KEY} Constraints

Starting from MySQL 3.23.43b, @code{InnoDB} features foreign key constraints.

@c description_for_help_topic CONSTRAINT  FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES NO ACTION ON DELETE CASCADE SET NULL RESTRICT UPDATE
The syntax of a foreign key constraint definition in @code{InnoDB} looks like
this:

@example
[CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY [id] (index_col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES tbl_name (index_col_name, ...)
    [ON DELETE @{CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | RESTRICT@}]
    [ON UPDATE @{CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | RESTRICT@}]
@end example
@c end_description_for_help_topic

Both tables must be @code{InnoDB} type.  In the referencing table, there must
be an index where the foreign key columns are listed as the @emph{first}
columns in the same order. In the referenced table, there must be an index
where the referenced columns are listed as the @emph{first} columns in
the same order. Index prefixes on foreign key columns are not supported.

@code{InnoDB} does not automatically create indexes on foreign keys or
referenced keys: You must create them explicitly. The indexes are needed
so that foreign key checks can be fast and not require a table scan.

Corresponding columns in the foreign key and the referenced key must
have similar internal data types inside @code{InnoDB} so that they can be
compared without a type conversion.
The @strong{size and the signedness of integer types has to be the same}.
The length of string types need not be the same.
If you specify a @code{SET NULL} action, make sure that you
have @strong{not declared the columns in the child table} as
@code{NOT NULL}.

If MySQL reports an error number 1005 from a @code{CREATE TABLE} statement,
and the error message string refers to errno 150, this means that the table
creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not correctly formed.
Similarly, if an @code{ALTER TABLE} fails and it refers to errno 150,
that means a foreign key definition would be incorrectly formed for the
altered table.  Starting from MySQL 4.0.13, you can use @code{SHOW INNODB
STATUS} to display a detailed explanation of the latest @code{InnoDB}
foreign key error in the server.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, @code{InnoDB} does not check foreign key
constraints on those foreign key or referenced key values
that contain a @code{NULL} column.

@strong{A deviation from SQL standards:} If in the parent table
there are several rows that have the same referenced key value,
then @code{InnoDB} acts in foreign key checks as if the other parent
rows with the same key value do not exist. For example,
if you have defined a @code{RESTRICT} type constraint, and there
is a child row with several parent rows, @code{InnoDB} does not allow
the deletion of any of those parent rows. 

Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, you can also associate the
@code{ON DELETE CASCADE} or @code{ON DELETE SET NULL} clause with
the foreign key constraint. Corresponding @code{ON UPDATE} options
are available starting from 4.0.8. If @code{ON DELETE CASCADE} is
specified, and a row in the parent table is deleted, @code{InnoDB}
automatically deletes also all those rows in the child table
whose foreign key values are equal to the referenced key value in
the parent row. If @code{ON DELETE SET NULL} is specified, the
child rows are automatically updated so that the columns in the
foreign key are set to the SQL @code{NULL} value.

@code{InnoDB} performs cascading operations through a depth-first algorithm,
based on records in the indexes corresponding to the foreign key
constraints.

@strong{A deviation from SQL standards:} If
@code{ON UPDATE CASCADE} or @code{ON UPDATE SET NULL} recurses to
update the @emph{same table} it has already updated during the cascade,
it acts like @code{RESTRICT}. This means that you cannot use
self-referential @code{ON UPDATE CASCADE} or
@code{ON UPDATE SET NULL} operations.
This is to prevent infinite loops resulting from cascaded updates.
A self-referential @code{ON DELETE SET NULL}, on the other hand,
is possible from 4.0.13.
A self-referential @code{ON DELETE CASCADE} has been possible since @code{ON
DELETE} was implemented.

A simple example that relates @code{parent} and @code{child} tables through a
single-column foreign key:

@example
CREATE TABLE parent(id INT NOT NULL,
                    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE child(id INT, parent_id INT,
                   INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
                   FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id)
                     ON DELETE CASCADE
) TYPE=INNODB;
@end example

A more complex example in which a @code{product_order} table has foreign keys
for two other tables. One foreign key references a two-column index in the
@code{product} table. The other references a single-column index in the
@code{customer} table:

@c example_for_help_topic CONSTRAINT
@example
CREATE TABLE product (category INT NOT NULL, id INT NOT NULL,
                      price DECIMAL,
                      PRIMARY KEY(category, id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE customer (id INT NOT NULL,
                      PRIMARY KEY (id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE product_order (no INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                      product_category INT NOT NULL,
                      product_id INT NOT NULL,
                      customer_id INT NOT NULL,
                      PRIMARY KEY(no),
                      INDEX (product_category, product_id),
                      FOREIGN KEY (product_category, product_id)
                        REFERENCES product(category, id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,
                      INDEX (customer_id),
                      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
                        REFERENCES customer(id)) TYPE=INNODB;
@end example

Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, @code{InnoDB} allows you to add a new
foreign key constraint to a table by using @code{ALTER TABLE}:

@example
ALTER TABLE yourtablename
    ADD [CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY [id] (index_col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES tbl_name (index_col_name, ...)
    [ON DELETE @{CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | RESTRICT@}]
    [ON UPDATE @{CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION | RESTRICT@}]
@end example

@strong{Remember to create the required indexes first}.
You can also add a self-referential foreign key constraint to a
table using @code{ALTER TABLE}.

Starting from MySQL 4.0.13, @code{InnoDB} supports the use of @code{ALTER
TABLE} to drop foreign keys:

@example
ALTER TABLE yourtablename
    DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_symbol
@end example

If the @code{FOREIGN KEY} clause included a @code{CONSTRAINT} name when you
created the foreign key, you can refer to that name to drop the foreign key.
(A constraint name can be given as of MySQL 4.0.18.)  Otherwise, the
@code{fk_symbol} value is internally generated by @code{InnoDB} when the
foreign key is created. To find out the symbol when you want to drop a foreign
key, use the @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} statement.
An example:

@example
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE ibtest11c\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: ibtest11c
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `ibtest11c` (
  `A` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `D` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `B` varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
  `C` varchar(175) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`A`,`D`,`B`),
  KEY `B` (`B`,`C`),
  KEY `C` (`C`),
  CONSTRAINT `0_38775` FOREIGN KEY (`A`, `D`)
REFERENCES `ibtest11a` (`A`, `D`)
ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT `0_38776` FOREIGN KEY (`B`, `C`)
REFERENCES `ibtest11a` (`B`, `C`)
ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
) TYPE=InnoDB CHARSET=latin1
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE ibtest11c DROP FOREIGN KEY 0_38775;
@end example

Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, the @code{InnoDB} parser allows you to use
backticks around table and column names in a
@code{FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ...} clause.
Starting from MySQL 4.0.5, the @code{InnoDB} parser also takes into account
the @code{lower_case_table_names} system variable setting.

Before MySQL 3.23.50, @code{ALTER TABLE} or @code{CREATE INDEX}
should not be used in connection with tables that have foreign
key constraints or that are referenced in foreign key constraints:
Any @code{ALTER TABLE} removes all foreign key
constraints defined for the table. You should not use
@code{ALTER TABLE} with the referenced table, either. Instead,
use @code{DROP TABLE} and @code{CREATE TABLE} to modify the
schema. When MySQL does an @code{ALTER TABLE} it may internally
use @code{RENAME TABLE}, and that will confuse the
foreign key constraints that refer to the table.
In MySQL, a @code{CREATE INDEX} statement is processed as an
@code{ALTER TABLE}, so the same considerations apply.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.50, @code{InnoDB} returns the foreign key
definitions of a table as part of the output of the @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}
statement:

@example
SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name;
@end example

From this version, @code{mysqldump} also produces correct definitions
of tables to the dump file, and does not forget about the foreign keys.

You can display the foreign key constraints for a table like this:
@example
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM db_name LIKE 'tbl_name'
@end example

The foreign key constraints are listed in the @code{Comment} column of
the output.

When performing foreign key checks, @code{InnoDB} sets shared row
level locks on child or parent records it has to look at.
@code{InnoDB} checks foreign key constraints immediately; the check
is not deferred to transaction commit.

To make it easier to reload dump files for tables that have foreign key
relationships, @code{mysqldump} automatically includes a statement in the
dump output to set @code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} to 0 as of MySQL 4.1.1. This
avoids problems with tables having to be reloaded in a particular order
when the dump is reloaded.  For earlier versions, you can disable the
variable manually within @code{mysql} when loading the dump file like this:

@example
mysql> SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
mysql> SOURCE dump_file_name;
mysql> SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
@end example

This allows you to import the tables in any order if the dump file contains
tables that are not correctly ordered for foreign keys. It also speeds
up the import operation.  @code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} is available starting
from MySQL 3.23.52 and 4.0.3.

Setting @code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} to 0 can also be useful for ignoring
foreign key constraints during @code{LOAD DATA} operations.

@code{InnoDB} allows you to drop any table, even though that
would break the foreign key constraints that reference
the table. When you drop a table, the constraints that
were defined in its create statement are also dropped.

If you re-create a table that was dropped, it must have
a definition that conforms to the foreign key constraints
referencing it. It must have the right column names and types,
and it must have indexes on the referenced keys, as stated earlier.
If these are not satisfied, MySQL returns error number 1005
and refers to errno 150 in the error message string.


@node InnoDB and MySQL Replication, Multiple tablespaces, InnoDB foreign key constraints, Using InnoDB tables
@subsection @code{InnoDB} and MySQL Replication

@c TODO: Add xref to here from replication chapter.

MySQL replication works for @code{InnoDB} tables as it does
for @code{MyISAM} tables. It is also possible to use replication in
a way where the table type on the slave is not the same as the original
table type on the master.  For example, you can replicate modifications to
an @code{InnoDB} table on the master to a @code{MyISAM} table on the slave.

To set up a new slave for a master, you have to make a copy of the
@code{InnoDB} tablespace and the log files, as well as the @file{.frm} files
of the @code{InnoDB} tables, and move the copies to the slave.
For the proper procedure to do this, see @ref{Moving}.

If you can shut down the master or an existing slave, you can take a
cold backup of the @code{InnoDB} tablespace and log files and use that to
set up a slave.
To make a new slave without taking down any server you can also use
the non-free (commercial) @uref{http://www.innodb.com/order.html,@code{InnoDB Hot Backup} tool}.

There are minor limitations in @code{InnoDB} replication:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} does not work for @code{InnoDB} type
tables. There are workarounds: 1) dump the table on the master and import the
dump file into the slave, or 2) use @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE=MyISAM}
on the master before setting up replication with @code{LOAD TABLE tbl_name
FROM MASTER}, and then use @code{ALTER TABLE} to alter the master table
back to the @code{InnoDB} type afterward.
@item
Before MySQL 4.0.6, @code{SLAVE STOP} did not
respect the boundary of a multiple-statement transaction.
An incomplete transaction would be rolled back, and the next
@code{SLAVE START} would only execute the remaining part of the half
transaction. That would cause replication to fail.
@item
Before MySQL 4.0.6, a slave crash in the middle of a
multiple-statement transaction would cause the same problem as
@code{SLAVE STOP}.
@item
Before MySQL 4.0.11, replication of the
@code{SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0} statement does not work properly.
@end itemize

Most of these limitations can be eliminated by using more recent server
versions for which the limitations do not apply.

Transactions that fail on the master do not affect replication at all.
MySQL replication is based on the binary log where MySQL writes SQL
statements that modify data. A slave reads the binary log of the master and
executes the same SQL statements. However, statements that occur within a
transaction are not written to the binary log until the transaction commits,
at which point all statements in the transaction are written at once.
If a statement fails, for example, because of a foreign key violation,
or if a transaction is rolled back, no SQL statements are written to the
binary log, and the transaction is not executed on the slave at all.


@node Multiple tablespaces,  , InnoDB and MySQL Replication, Using InnoDB tables
@subsection Using Per-Table Tablespaces

Starting from MySQL 4.1.1, you can store each @code{InnoDB} table and its
indexes into its own file. This feature is called ``multiple tablespaces''
because in effect each table has its own tablespace.

@strong{Important note:} If you upgrade to MySQL 4.1.1 or higher, it is
difficult to downgrade back to 4.0 or 4.1.0! That is because earlier
versions of @code{InnoDB} are not aware of multiple tablespaces.

If you need to downgrade to 4.0, you have to take table dumps and
re-create the whole @code{InnoDB} tablespace. If you have not created new
@code{InnoDB} tables under MySQL 4.1.1 or later, and need to downgrade
quickly, you can also do a direct downgrade to the MySQL
4.0.18 or later in the 4.0 series.
Before doing the direct downgrade to 4.0.x, you have to end all client
connections to the @code{mysqld} server that is to be downgraded, and let it
run the purge and insert buffer merge operations to completion, so that
@code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} shows the main thread in the state
@code{waiting for server activity}. Then you can shut down
@code{mysqld} and start 4.0.18 or later in the 4.0 series.
A direct downgrade is not recommended, however, because it has not
been extensively tested.

You can enable multiple tablespaces by adding a line to the
@code{[mysqld]} section of @file{my.cnf}:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_file_per_table
@end example

After restarting the server, @code{InnoDB} will store each newly created
table into its own file @file{tbl_name.ibd} in the database directory
where the table belongs.  This is similar to what the @code{MyISAM}
storage engine does, but @code{MyISAM} divides the table into a data
file @file{tbl_name.MYD} and the index file @file{tbl_name.MYI}.
For @code{InnoDB}, the data and the indexes are stored together in the
@file{.ibd} file.  The @file{tbl_name.frm} file is still created as usual.

If you remove the @code{innodb_file_per_table} line from @file{my.cnf} and
restart the server, @code{InnoDB} creates tables inside the shared tablespace
files again.

@code{innodb_file_per_table} affects only table creation. If you start the
server with this option, new tables are created using @file{.ibd} files, but you can still access tables that exist in the shared
tablespace. If you remove the option, new tables are created in the shared
tablespace, but you can still access any tables that
were created using multiple tablespaces.

@code{InnoDB} always needs the shared tablespace. The @file{.ibd}
files are not sufficient for @code{InnoDB} to operate. The shared tablespace
consists of the familiar @file{ibdata} files where @code{InnoDB} puts its
internal data dictionary and undo logs.

@strong{You cannot freely move @file{.ibd} files around} between database
directories the way you can with
@code{MyISAM} table files. This is because the table definition is stored
in the @code{InnoDB} shared tablespace, and also because @code{InnoDB}
must preserve the consistency of transaction IDs and log sequence numbers.

Within a given MySQL installation, you can move an @file{.ibd} file and the
associated table from one database to another with the familiar @code{RENAME
TABLE} statement:

@example
RENAME TABLE old_db_name.tbl_name TO new_db_name.tbl_name;
@end example

If you have a ``clean'' backup of an @file{.ibd} file,
you can restore it to the MySQL installation from which it originated as
follows:

@c TODO: ALTER TABLE section needs DISCARD/IMPORT TABLESPACE

@enumerate
@item
Issue this @code{ALTER TABLE} statement:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISCARD TABLESPACE;
@end example

Caution: This deletes the current @file{.ibd} file.

@item
Put the backup @file{.ibd} file back in the proper database directory.

@item
Issue this @code{ALTER TABLE} statement:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name IMPORT TABLESPACE;
@end example

@end enumerate

In this context, a ``clean'' @file{.ibd} file backup means:

@itemize @bullet
@item
There are no uncommitted modifications by transactions in the @file{.ibd}
file. 
@item
There are no unmerged insert buffer entries in the @file{.ibd} file.
@item
Purge has removed all delete-marked index records from the @file{.ibd} file. 
@item
@code{mysqld} has flushed all modified pages of the @file{.ibd} file from
the buffer pool to the file. 
@end itemize

You can make such a clean backup @file{.ibd} file with the following method:

@enumerate
@item
Stop all activity from the @code{mysqld} server and commit all transactions.
@item 
Wait until @code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} shows that there are no active
transactions in the database, and the main thread status of @code{InnoDB} is
@code{Waiting for server activity}. Then you can make a copy of the
@file{.ibd} file. 
@end enumerate

Another method for making a clean copy of an @file{.ibd} file is to
use the commercial @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} tool:

@enumerate
@item
Use @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} to back up the @code{InnoDB} installation.
@item
Start a second @code{mysqld} server on the backup and let it clean up
the @file{.ibd} files in the backup. 
@end enumerate

It is in the TODO to also allow moving clean @file{.ibd} files to
another MySQL installation. This requires resetting of
transaction IDs and log sequence numbers in the @file{.ibd} file.


@node Adding and removing, Backing up, Using InnoDB tables, InnoDB
@section Adding and Removing @code{InnoDB} Data and Log Files

This section describes what you can do when your @code{InnoDB} tablespace runs
out of room or when you want to change the size of the log files.

From MySQL 3.23.50 and 4.0.2, the easiest way to increase the size of the
@code{InnoDB} tablespace is to configure it from the beginning to be
auto-extending.  Specify the @code{autoextend} attribute for the last
data file in the tablespace definition. Then @code{InnoDB} will increase the
size of that file automatically in 8MB increments when it runs out of space.

Alternatively, you can increase the size of your tablespace by adding another
data file. To do this, you have to shut down the MySQL server,
edit the @file{my.cnf} file to add a new data file to the end of
@code{innodb_data_file_path}, and start the server again.

If your last data file already was defined with the keyword @code{autoextend},
the procedure to edit @file{my.cnf} must take into account the size to
which the last data file has grown. You have to
look at the size of the data file, round the size downward to the
closest multiple of 1024 * 1024 bytes (= 1MB), and specify the rounded
size explicitly in @code{innodb_data_file_path}. Then you can add
another data file.  Remember that only the last data file in the
@code{innodb_data_file_path} can be specified as auto-extending.

As an example, assume that the tablespace has just one auto-extending data file
@file{ibdata1}:

@example
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:10M:autoextend
@end example

Suppose that that this data file, over time, has grown to 988MB. Below is the
configuration line after adding another auto-extending data file.

@example
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:988M;/disk2/ibdata2:50M:autoextend
@end example

When you add a new file to the tablespace, make sure that it does not
exist so that @code{InnoDB} creates it and initializes it when you restart
the server.

Currently, you cannot remove a data file from the tablespace. To decrease the
size of your tablespace, use this procedure:

If you want to change the number or the size of your @code{InnoDB} log
files, you have to stop the MySQL server and make sure that it shuts down
without errors.  Then copy the old log files into a safe place just in case
something went wrong in the shutdown and you will need them to recover the
tablespace. Delete the old log files from the log file directory, edit
@file{my.cnf} to change the log file configuration, and start the MySQL
server again. @code{mysqld} will see that the no log files exist at startup
and tell you that it is creating new ones.

@section Backing Up and Recovering an @code{InnoDB} Database

The key to safe database management is taking regular backups.

@code{InnoDB Hot Backup} is an online backup tool you can use to backup
your @code{InnoDB} database while it is running. @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} does not
require you to shut down your database and it does not set any locks or
disturb your normal database processing. @code{InnoDB Hot Backup}
is a non-free (commercial) additional tool whose annual license fee is
390 euros per computer where the MySQL server is run.
See the @uref{http://www.innodb.com/order.html,@code{InnoDB Hot Backup} homepage}
for detailed information and screenshots.

If you are able to shut down your MySQL server, you can make
a ``binary'' backup that consists of all files used by @code{InnoDB} to manage
its tables. Use the following procedure:

@enumerate
@item
Shut down your MySQL server and make sure that it shuts down without errors.
@item
Copy all your data files into a safe place.
@item
Copy all your @code{InnoDB} log files to a safe place.
@item
Copy your @file{my.cnf} configuration file or files to a safe place.
@item
Copy all the @file{.frm} files for your @code{InnoDB} tables to a safe place.
@end enumerate

Replication works with @code{InnoDB} type tables, so you can use MySQL
replication capabilities to keep a copy of your database at database sites
requiring high availability.

In addition to taking binary backups as just described,
you should also regularly take dumps of your tables with
@code{mysqldump}. The reason for this is that a binary file
might be corrupted without you noticing it. Dumped tables are stored
into text files that are human-readable, so spotting table corruption
becomes easier. Also, since the format is simpler, the chance for
serious data corruption is smaller.
@code{mysqldump} also has a @code{--single-transaction} option that
you can use to take a consistent snapshot without locking out other
clients.

To be able to recover your @code{InnoDB} database to the present from the
binary backup described above, you have to run your MySQL server
with binary logging turned on. Then you can apply the binary log to the
backup database to achieve point-in-time recovery:

@example
mysqlbinlog yourhostname-bin.123 | mysql
@end example

To recover from a crash of your MySQL server process, the only thing
you have to do is to restart it. @code{InnoDB} will automatically check the
logs and perform a roll-forward of the database to the present.
@code{InnoDB} will automatically roll back uncommitted transactions that were
present at the time of the crash. During recovery, @code{mysqld} will
display output something like this:

@example
InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.
InnoDB: Starting recovery from log files...
InnoDB: Starting log scan based on checkpoint at
InnoDB: log sequence number 0 13674004
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13739520
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13805056
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13870592
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 13936128
...
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20555264
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20620800
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 0 20664692
InnoDB: 1 uncommitted transaction(s) which must be rolled back
InnoDB: Starting rollback of uncommitted transactions
InnoDB: Rolling back trx no 16745
InnoDB: Rolling back of trx no 16745 completed
InnoDB: Rollback of uncommitted transactions completed
InnoDB: Starting an apply batch of log records to the database...
InnoDB: Apply batch completed
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
@end example

If your database gets corrupted or your disk fails, you have
to do the recovery from a backup. In the case of corruption, you should
first find a backup that is not corrupted. After restoring the base
backup, do the recovery from the binary log files.

In some cases of database corruption it is enough just to dump, drop,
and re-create one or a few corrupt tables. You can use the
@code{CHECK TABLE} SQL statement to check whether a table is corrupt, though
@code{CHECK TABLE} naturally cannot detect every possible kind of corruption.
You can use @code{innodb_tablespace_monitor} to check the integrity of
the file space management inside the tablespace files.

In some cases, apparent database page corruption is actually due to the
operating system corrupting its own file cache, and the data
on disk may be okay. It is best first to try restarting your computer.
It may eliminate errors that appeared to be database page corruption.

@node Forcing recovery, InnoDB checkpoints, Backing up, Backing up
@subsection Forcing Recovery

If there is database page corruption, you may want to dump
your tables from the database with @code{SELECT INTO OUTFILE},
and usually most of the data
is intact and correct. But the corruption may cause
@code{SELECT * FROM tbl_name} or @code{InnoDB}
background operations to crash or assert, or even the @code{InnoDB}
roll-forward recovery to crash. Starting from MySQL
3.23.44, there is an @code{InnoDB} variable that you can use to
force the @code{InnoDB} storage engine to start up, and you can also
prevent background operations from running, so that
you will be able to dump your tables. For example, you can add the following
line to the @code{[mysqld]} section of your option file before restarting the
server:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_force_recovery = 4
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0, use this syntax instead:

@example
[mysqld]
set-variable = innodb_force_recovery=4
@end example

The allowable non-zero values for @code{innodb_force_recovery} follow.
A larger number includes all precautions of lower numbers. If you are
able to dump your tables with an option value of at most 4, then you are
relatively safe that only some data on corrupt individual pages
is lost. A value of 6 is more dramatic, because database pages are left
in an obsolete state, which in turn may introduce more corruption
into B-trees and other database structures.

@c Note: Do not remove blank lines following the @item lines

@itemize @bullet

@item @code{1} (@code{SRV_FORCE_IGNORE_CORRUPT})

Let the server run even if it detects a corrupt page; try to make
@code{SELECT * FROM tbl_name} jump over corrupt index records and pages,
which helps in dumping tables.

@item @code{2} (@code{SRV_FORCE_NO_BACKGROUND})

Prevent the main thread from running. If a crash would occur
in the purge operation, this prevents it.

@item @code{3} (@code{SRV_FORCE_NO_TRX_UNDO})

Do not run transaction rollbacks after recovery.

@item @code{4} (@code{SRV_FORCE_NO_IBUF_MERGE})

Prevent also insert buffer merge operations. If they would cause a
crash, better not do them; do not calculate table statistics.

@item @code{5} (@code{SRV_FORCE_NO_UNDO_LOG_SCAN})

Do not look at undo logs when starting the database: @code{InnoDB} will
treat even incomplete transactions as committed.

@item @code{6} (@code{SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO})

Do not do the log roll-forward in connection with recovery.

@end itemize

The database must not otherwise be used with these options!  As a safety
measure, @code{InnoDB} prevents users from doing @code{INSERT},
@code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE} when @code{innodb_force_recovery} is set to
a value greater than 0.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.53 and 4.0.4, you are allowed to @code{DROP} or
@code{CREATE} a table even if forced recovery is used. If you know that a
certain table is causing a crash in rollback, you can drop it.  You can use
this also to stop a runaway rollback caused by a failing mass import or
@code{ALTER TABLE}.  You can kill the @code{mysqld} process and set
@code{innodb_force_recovery} to @code{3} to bring your database up without
the rollback.  Then @code{DROP} the table that is causing the runaway
rollback.


@node InnoDB checkpoints,  , Forcing recovery, Backing up
@subsection Checkpoints

@code{InnoDB} implements a checkpoint mechanism called a ``fuzzy
checkpoint.'' @code{InnoDB} will flush modified database pages from the buffer
pool in small batches. There is no need to flush the buffer pool
in one single batch, which would in practice stop processing
of user SQL statements for a while.

In crash recovery, @code{InnoDB} looks for a checkpoint label written
to the log files. It knows that all modifications to the database
before the label are already present in the disk image of the database.
Then @code{InnoDB} scans the log files forward from the place of the
checkpoint,
applying the logged modifications to the database.

@code{InnoDB} writes to the log files in a circular fashion.
All committed modifications that make the database pages in the buffer
pool different from the images on disk must be available in the log files
in case @code{InnoDB} has to do a recovery. This means that when @code{InnoDB} starts
to reuse a log file in the circular fashion, it has to make sure that the
database page images on disk already contain the modifications
logged in the log file @code{InnoDB} is going to reuse. In other words,
@code{InnoDB}
has to make a checkpoint and often this involves flushing of
modified database pages to disk.

The preceding description explains why making your log files very big may save
disk I/O in checkpointing. It can make sense to set
the total size of the log files as big as the buffer pool or even bigger.
The drawback of big log files is that crash recovery can take longer
because there will be more logged information to apply to the database.


@node Moving, InnoDB transaction model, Backing up, InnoDB
@section Moving an @code{InnoDB} Database to Another Machine

On Windows, @code{InnoDB} internally always stores database and
table names in lowercase. To move databases in a binary format 
from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Unix, you should have all table
and database names in lowercase. A convenient way to accomplish this
on Unix is to add the following line to the @code{[mysqld]} section of
your @file{my.cnf} before you start creating your databases and tables:

@example
[mysqld]
set-variable = lower_case_table_names=1
@end example

On Windows, @code{lower_case_table_names} is set to @code{1} by default.

Like @code{MyISAM} data files, @code{InnoDB} data and log files are
binary-compatible on all platforms if the floating-point number format on
the machines is the same.  You can move an @code{InnoDB} database simply by
copying all the relevant files, which were listed in @ref{Backing up}.  If
the floating-point formats on the machines are different but you have not
used @code{FLOAT} or @code{DOUBLE} data types in your tables, then the
procedure is the same: Just copy the relevant files. If the formats are
different and your tables contain floating-point data, you have to use
@code{mysqldump} to dump your tables on one machine and then import the dump
files on the other machine.

A performance tip is to switch off autocommit mode when you import
data into your database, assuming that your tablespace has enough space for
the big rollback segment the big import transaction will generate.
Do the commit only after importing a whole table or a segment of
a table.

@section @code{InnoDB} Transaction Model and Locking

In the @code{InnoDB} transaction model, the goal has been to combine the
best properties of a multi-versioning database with traditional two-phase
locking.  @code{InnoDB} does locking on the row level and runs queries as
non-locking consistent reads by default, in the style of Oracle.  The lock
table in @code{InnoDB} is stored so space-efficiently that lock escalation
is not needed: Typically several users are allowed to lock every row in the
database, or any random subset of the rows, without @code{InnoDB} running
out of memory.

@node InnoDB and AUTOCOMMIT, InnoDB transaction isolation, InnoDB transaction model, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection @code{InnoDB} and @code{AUTOCOMMIT}

In @code{InnoDB}, all user activity occurs inside a transaction. If the
autocommit mode is enabled, each SQL statement forms a
single transaction on its own. MySQL always starts a new connection
with autocommit enabled.

If the autocommit mode is switched off with @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0},
then we can think that a user always has a transaction open. An
SQL @code{COMMIT} or @code{ROLLBACK} statement ends the
current transaction and a new one starts. Both statements will release
all @code{InnoDB} locks that were set during the current transaction.
A @code{COMMIT} means that the changes made in the current transaction
are made permanent and become visible to other users.
A @code{ROLLBACK} statement, on the other hand, cancels all
modifications made by the current transaction.

If the connection has autocommit enabled, the user can still
perform a multiple-statement transaction by starting it with an
explicit @code{START TRANSACTION} or @code{BEGIN} statement and ending it with
@code{COMMIT} or @code{ROLLBACK}.


@node InnoDB transaction isolation, InnoDB consistent read, InnoDB and AUTOCOMMIT, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection @code{InnoDB} and @code{TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL}

In terms of the SQL:1992 transaction isolation levels,
the @code{InnoDB} default is @code{REPEATABLE READ}.
Starting from MySQL 4.0.5, @code{InnoDB} offers all four different
transaction isolation levels described by the SQL standard.
You can set the default isolation level for all connections by using the
@code{--transaction-isolation} option on the command line or in option files.
For example, you can set the option
in the @code{[mysqld]} section of @file{my.cnf} like this:

@example
[mysqld]
transaction-isolation = @{READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED
                         | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE@}
@end example

A user can change the isolation level of a single session or
all new incoming connections with the @code{SET TRANSACTION}
statement. Its syntax is as follows:

@example
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
                       @{READ UNCOMMITTED | READ COMMITTED
                        | REPEATABLE READ | SERIALIZABLE@}
@end example

Note that there are hyphens in the level names for the
@code{--transaction-isolation} option, but not for the @code{SET
TRANSACTION} statement.

The default behavior is to set the isolation level for the next (not
started) transaction. If you use the @code{GLOBAL} keyword, the statement
sets the default transaction level globally for all new connections
created from that point on (but not existing connections).
You need the @code{SUPER} privilege to do this.  Using the @code{SESSION}
keyword sets the default transaction level for all future transactions
performed on the current connection.

Any client is free to change the session isolation level (even in the
middle of a transaction), or the isolation level for the next
transaction.

Before MySQL 3.23.50, @code{SET TRANSACTION} had no effect
on @code{InnoDB} tables. Before 4.0.5, only @code{REPEATABLE READ}
and @code{SERIALIZABLE} were available.

You can query the global and session transaction isolation levels with these
statements:

@example
SELECT @@@@global.tx_isolation;
SELECT @@@@tx_isolation;
@end example

In row-level locking, @code{InnoDB} uses so-called ``next-key locking.''
That means that besides index records, @code{InnoDB} can also lock
the ``gap'' before an index record to block insertions by other users
immediately before the index record. A next-key lock refers to
a lock that locks an index record and the gap before it.
A gap lock refers to a lock that only locks a gap before some
index record.

A detailed description of each isolation level in @code{InnoDB}:

@c Note: Do not remove blank lines following the @item lines

@itemize @bullet

@item @code{READ UNCOMMITTED}

@code{SELECT} statements are performed in a non-locking fashion, but a
possible earlier version of a record might be used. Thus, using this
isolation level, such reads are not ``consistent.'' This is also called
``dirty read.''  Other than that, this isolation level works like @code{READ
COMMITTED}.

@item @code{READ COMMITTED}

A somewhat Oracle-like isolation level.  All @code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE}
and @code{SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE} statements lock only the index
records, not the gaps before them, and thus allow free inserting of new
records next to locked records.  @code{UPDATE} and @code{DELETE} statements
that use a unique index with a unique search condition lock only the index
record found, not the gap before it.  In range-type @code{UPDATE}
and @code{DELETE} statements, @code{InnoDB} must set next-key or gap locks
and block insertions by other users to the gaps covered by the range. This
is necessary because ``phantom rows'' must be blocked for MySQL replication
and recovery to work.

Consistent reads behave as in Oracle: Each consistent read,
even within the same transaction, sets and reads its own fresh
snapshot.
@xref{InnoDB consistent read}.

@item @code{REPEATABLE READ}

This is the default isolation level of @code{InnoDB}.
@code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE}, @code{SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE},
@code{UPDATE}, and @code{DELETE} statements that use a unique index with a
unique search condition lock only the index record found, not the gap
before it.
With other search conditions, these operations employ next-key locking,
locking the index range scanned with next-key or gap locks, and block
new insertions by other users.

In consistent reads, there is an important difference from the
previous isolation level: In this level, all consistent reads within
the same transaction read the same snapshot established by the first
read. This convention means that if you issue several plain
@code{SELECT} statements within the same transaction, these
@code{SELECT} statements are consistent also with respect to each
other.
@xref{InnoDB consistent read}.

@item @code{SERIALIZABLE}

This level is like @code{REPEATABLE READ}, but all plain
@code{SELECT} statements are implicitly converted to
@code{SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE}.

@end itemize


@node InnoDB consistent read, InnoDB locking reads, InnoDB transaction isolation, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection Consistent Non-Locking Read

A consistent read means that @code{InnoDB} uses its multi-versioning to
present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time.
The query will see the changes made by exactly those transactions
that committed before that point of time, and no changes made by
later or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule
is that the query will see the changes made by the transaction
itself that issues the query. 

If you are running with the default @code{REPEATABLE READ} isolation level,
then all consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot
established by the first such read in that transaction. You can get a
fresher snapshot for your queries by committing the current transaction
and after that issuing new queries. 

Consistent read is the default mode in which @code{InnoDB} processes
@code{SELECT} statements in @code{READ COMMITTED} and
@code{REPEATABLE READ} isolation levels. A consistent read
does not set any locks on the tables it accesses, and
therefore other users are free to modify those tables at
the same time a consistent read is being performed on the table. 


@node InnoDB locking reads, InnoDB Next-key locking, InnoDB consistent read, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection Locking Reads @code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE} and @code{SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE}

In some circumstances, a consistent read is not convenient.
For example, you might want to add a new row into your table @code{child},
and make sure that the child already has a parent in table
@code{parent}.  The following example shows how to implement referential
integrity in your application code.

Suppose that you use a consistent read to read the table @code{parent}
and indeed see the parent of the child in the table. Can you now safely
add the child row to table @code{child}? No, because it may
happen that meanwhile some other user deletes the parent row
from the table @code{parent}, without you being aware of it.

The solution is to perform the @code{SELECT} in a locking
mode using @code{LOCK IN SHARE MODE}:
  
@example
SELECT * FROM parent WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
@end example

Performing a read in share mode means that we read the latest
available data, and set a shared mode lock on the rows we read.
A shared mode lock prevents others from updating or deleting
the row we have read.  Also,
if the latest data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another
client connection, we will wait until that transaction commits.
After we see that the preceding query returns
the parent @code{'Jones'}, we can safely add the child record
to the @code{child} table and commit our transaction.

Let us look at another example: We have an integer counter field in
a table @code{child_codes} that we use to assign
a unique identifier to each child added to table @code{child}.
Obviously, using a consistent read or a shared mode read
to read the present value of the counter is not a good idea, since
two users of the database may then see the same value for the
counter, and a duplicate-key error will occur if two users attempt to add
children with the same identifier to the table.

Here, @code{LOCK IN SHARE MODE} is not a good solution because if two
users read the counter at the same time, at least one of them
will end up in deadlock when attempting to update the counter.

In this case, there are two good ways to implement the reading and
incrementing of the counter:
(1) update the counter first by incrementing it by 1 and only after
that read it, or
(2) read the counter first with a lock mode @code{FOR UPDATE}, and
increment after that. The latter approach can be implemented as follows:

@example
SELECT counter_field FROM child_codes FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE child_codes SET counter_field = counter_field + 1;
@end example

A @code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE} reads the latest
available data, setting exclusive locks on each row it reads.
Thus it sets the same locks a searched SQL @code{UPDATE} would set
on the rows.

Please note that the above is merely an example of how @code{SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE} works. In MySQL, the specific task of generating a unique identifier
actually can be accomplished using only a single access to the table:

@example
UPDATE child_codes
       SET counter_field = LAST_INSERT_ID(counter_field + 1);
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
@end example

The @code{SELECT} statement merely retrieves the identifier information
(specific to the current connection). It does not access any table.


@node InnoDB Next-key locking, InnoDB Consistent read example, InnoDB locking reads, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection Next-Key Locking: Avoiding the Phantom Problem

In row-level locking, @code{InnoDB} uses an algorithm called ``next-key locking.''
@code{InnoDB} does the row-level locking in such a way that when it searches
or scans an index of a table, it sets shared or exclusive locks
on the index records it encounters. Thus the row-level locks are
actually index record locks.

The locks @code{InnoDB} sets on index records also affect the ``gap'' before
that index record. If a user has a shared or exclusive lock on record
@code{R} in an index, another user cannot insert a new index record
immediately before @code{R} in the index order.  This locking of gaps is
done to prevent the so-called ``phantom problem.'' Suppose that you want to read and
lock all children from the @code{child} table with an identifier value
larger than 100, with the intent of updating some column in the selected
rows later:

@example
SELECT * FROM child WHERE id > 100 FOR UPDATE;
@end example

Suppose that there is an index on the @code{id} column. The query will scan that
index starting from the first record where @code{id} is bigger than 100.
Now, if the locks set on the index records would not lock out inserts made
in the gaps, a new row might meanwhile be inserted to the table. If you now
execute the same @code{SELECT} within the same transaction, you would see a
new row in the result set returned by the query.  This is contrary the
isolation principle of transactions: A transaction should be able to run so
that the data it has read does not change during the transaction. If we
regard a set of rows as a data item, the new ``phantom'' child would violate
this isolation principle.

When @code{InnoDB} scans an index, it can also lock the gap
after the last record in the index. Just that happens in the previous
example: The locks set by @code{InnoDB} prevent any insert to
the table where @code{id} would be bigger than 100.

You can use next-key locking to implement a uniqueness
check in your application: If you read your data in share mode
and do not see a duplicate for a row you are going to insert,
then you can safely insert your row and know that the next-key
lock set on the successor of your row during the read will prevent
anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate for your row. Thus the next-key
locking allows you to ``lock'' the non-existence of something in your
table.


@node InnoDB Consistent read example, InnoDB Locks set, InnoDB Next-key locking, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection An Example of How the Consistent Read Works in @code{InnoDB}

Suppose that you are running in the default @code{REPEATABLE READ} isolation level.
When you issue a consistent read, that is, an ordinary @code{SELECT}
statement, @code{InnoDB} will give your transaction a timepoint according
to which your query sees the database. If another transaction deletes
a row and commits after your timepoint was assigned, you will
not see the row as having been deleted. Inserts and updates are treated
similarly.

You can advance your timepoint by committing your transaction
and then doing another @code{SELECT}.

This is called ``multi-versioned concurrency control.''

@example
               User A                 User B

           SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;      SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
time
|          SELECT * FROM t;
|          empty set
|                                 INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 2);
|
v          SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set
                                  COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           empty set

           COMMIT;

           SELECT * FROM t;
           ---------------------
           |    1    |    2    |
           ---------------------
           1 row in set
@end example

In this example,
user A sees the row inserted by B only when B has committed the
insert and A has committed as well, so that the timepoint
is advanced past the commit of B.

If you want to see the ``freshest'' state of the database, you should
use either the @code{READ COMMITTED} isolation level or a locking read:

@example
SELECT * FROM t LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
@end example


@node InnoDB Locks set, InnoDB implicit command or rollback, InnoDB Consistent read example, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection Locks Set by Different SQL Statements in @code{InnoDB}

A locking read, an @code{UPDATE}, or a @code{DELETE}
generally set record locks on every index record that is scanned in
the processing of the SQL query. It does not matter if there are
@code{WHERE} conditions in the query that would exclude the row
from the result set of the query. @code{InnoDB} does not remember the exact
@code{WHERE} condition, but only knows which index ranges were
scanned. The record locks are normally next-key locks that also block
inserts to the ``gap'' immediately before the record.

If the locks to be set are exclusive,
then @code{InnoDB} always retrieves also the clustered index record and sets
a lock on it.

If you do not have indexes suitable for your query and
MySQL has to scan the whole table to process the query,
every row of the table will become locked, which in turn blocks all
inserts by other users to the table. It is important to create good indexes
so that your queries do not unnecessarily need to scan many rows.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{SELECT ... FROM} is a consistent read, reading a snapshot of the
database and setting no locks unless the transaction isolation level is set
to @code{SERIALIZABLE}. For @code{SERIALIZABLE} level, this sets shared
next-key locks on the index records it encounters.

@item
@code{SELECT ... FROM ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE}
sets shared next-key locks on all index records the read encounters.

@item
@code{SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE}
sets exclusive next-key locks on all index records the read
encounters.

@item
@code{INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)}
sets an exclusive lock on the inserted row. Note that this lock is not
a next-key lock and does not prevent other users from inserting to the
gap before the inserted row. If a duplicate-key error occurs, a shared
lock on the duplicate index record is set.

@item
While initializing a previously specified @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column
on a table, @code{InnoDB} sets an exclusive lock on the end of the index
associated with the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.
In accessing the auto-increment counter, @code{InnoDB} uses a specific table
lock mode @code{AUTO-INC} where the lock lasts only to the end of the
current SQL statement, instead of to the end of the whole transaction.
@xref{InnoDB and AUTOCOMMIT,  , @code{InnoDB} and @code{AUTOCOMMIT}}.

Before MySQL 3.23.50, @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} applied to a table
with an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column sets an exclusive row-level lock
to the high end of the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} index. This means
also that @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} could cause a deadlock of transactions,
something that may surprise users. Starting from MySQL 3.23.50,
@code{InnoDB} fetches the value of a previously initialized
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column without setting any locks.

@item
@code{INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...}
sets an exclusive (non-next-key) lock on each row inserted into
@code{T}. It does the search on @code{S} as a consistent read, but
sets shared next-key locks on @code{S} if MySQL binary logging is turned
on. @code{InnoDB} has to set locks in the latter case: In
roll-forward recovery from a backup, every SQL statement has to be
executed in exactly the same way it was done originally.

@item
@code{CREATE TABLE ... SELECT ...}
performs the @code{SELECT} as a consistent read or with shared locks,
as in the previous item.

@item
@code{REPLACE}
is done like an insert if there is no collision on a unique key.
Otherwise, an exclusive next-key lock is placed on the row that has
to be updated.

@item
@code{UPDATE ... WHERE ...}
sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters.

@item
@code{DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...}
sets an exclusive next-key lock on every record the search encounters.

@item
If a @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraint is defined on a table, any insert,
update, or delete that requires checking of the constraint condition
sets shared record-level locks on the records it looks at to check the
constraint.  @code{InnoDB} also sets these locks
in the case where the constraint fails.

@item
@code{LOCK TABLES} sets table locks, but it is the higher MySQL layer above
the @code{InnoDB} layer that sets these locks. The automatic deadlock
detection of @code{InnoDB} cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks
are involved.
@xref{InnoDB Deadlock detection}.

Also, since the higher MySQL layer does not know about row-level locks, it
is possible to get a table lock on a table where another user
currently has row-level locks. But that does not put transaction
integrity in danger.

@subsection When Does MySQL Implicitly Commit or Roll Back a Transaction?

@c TODO: probably should merge this into the SQL chapter section that
@c also lists these conditions.

MySQL begins each client connection with autocommit mode enabled by default.
When autocommit enabled, MySQL does a commit after each SQL statement if
that statement did not return an error.

If you have the autocommit mode off and close a connection
without calling an explicit commit of your transaction,
then MySQL will roll back your transaction.

If an error is returned by an SQL statement, the commit/rollback
behavior depends on the error.
@xref{InnoDB Error handling}.

The following SQL statements cause an implicit commit of the
current transaction in MySQL:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{BEGIN}, @code{CREATE INDEX}, @code{DROP DATABASE},
@code{DROP INDEX}, @code{DROP TABLE}, @code{LOAD MASTER DATA}, @code{LOCK
TABLES}, @code{RENAME TABLE}, @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT=1}, @code{START
TRANSACTION}, @code{TRUNCATE}, @code{UNLOCK TABLES}.
@item
@code{CREATE TABLE} (this commits only if before MySQL 4.0.13 and MySQL
binary logging is used).
@item
The @code{CREATE TABLE} statement in @code{InnoDB} is processed as a single
transaction. It means that a @code{ROLLBACK} from the user does not
undo @code{CREATE TABLE} statements the user made during that
transaction.
@end itemize


@node InnoDB Deadlock detection, Innodb deadlocks, InnoDB implicit command or rollback, InnoDB transaction model
@subsection Deadlock Detection and Rollback

@code{InnoDB} automatically detects a deadlock of transactions and rolls back a
transaction or transactions to prevent the deadlock. Starting from
MySQL 4.0.5, @code{InnoDB} tries to pick small transactions to roll
back. The size of a transaction is determined by the number of rows
it has inserted, updated, or deleted. Prior to 4.0.5, @code{InnoDB}
always rolled back the transaction whose lock request was the last
one to build a deadlock, that is, a cycle in the ``waits-for'' graph
of transactions. 

@code{InnoDB} cannot detect deadlocks where a table lock set by a MySQL
@code{LOCK TABLES} statement is involved, or if a lock set
by another storage engine than @code{InnoDB} is involved. You have to resolve
these situations by setting the value of the  @code{innodb_lock_wait_timeout}
system variable.

When @code{InnoDB} performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all the
locks of the transaction are released. However, if just a single SQL
statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks
set by the SQL statement may be preserved. This is because @code{InnoDB}
stores row locks in a format such it cannot know afterward which lock was
set by which SQL statement.

@subsection How to Cope with Deadlocks

Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases, but they
are not dangerous unless they are so frequent that you cannot run
certain transactions at all. Normally, you must write your
applications so that they are always prepared to re-issue a
transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock. 

@code{InnoDB} uses automatic row-level locking. You can get deadlocks
even in the case of transactions that just insert or delete a
single row. That is because these operations are not really ``atomic'';
they automatically set locks on the (possibly several) index
records of the row inserted or deleted.

You can cope with deadlocks and reduce the likelihood of their occurrence
with the following techniques: 

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use @code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} to determine the cause of the latest deadlock.
That can help you to tune your application to avoid deadlocks.  This
strategy can be used as of MySQL 3.23.52 and 4.0.3, depending on your MySQL
series.
@item
Always be prepared to re-issue a transaction if it fails due to
deadlock. Deadlocks are not dangerous. Just try again. 
@item
Commit your transactions often. Small transactions are less prone to collide. 
@item
If you are using locking reads (@code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE}
or @code{... LOCK IN SHARE MODE}), try using a lower isolation
level such as @code{READ COMMITTED}. 
@item
Access your tables and rows in a fixed order. Then transactions
form nice queues and do not deadlock. 
@item
Add well-chosen indexes to your tables. Then your queries need to
scan fewer index records and consequently set fewer locks.
Use @code{EXPLAIN SELECT} to determine which indexes the MySQL
server regards as the most appropriate for your queries.
@item
Use less locking. If you can afford to allow a @code{SELECT} to return data
from an old snapshot, do not add the clause @code{FOR UPDATE}
or @code{LOCK IN SHARE MODE} to it. Using @code{READ COMMITTED}
isolation level is good here, because each consistent read
within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot. 
@item
If nothing helps, serialize your transactions with table-level locks.
For example, if you need to write table @code{t1} and read table @code{t2},
you can do this:

@example
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ...;
[do something with tables t1 and t2 here];
UNLOCK TABLES;
@end example

Table-level locks make your transactions queue nicely,
and deadlocks are avoided. Note that @code{LOCK TABLES}
implicitly starts a transaction, just like the statement @code{BEGIN},
and @code{UNLOCK TABLES} implicitly ends the transaction in a @code{COMMIT}. 
@item
Another way to serialize transactions is to create
an auxiliary ``semaphore'' table that contains just a
single row. Have each transaction update that row before
accessing other tables. In that way, all transactions
happen in a serial fashion. Note that the @code{InnoDB} instant
deadlock detection algorithm also works in this case,
because the serializing lock is a row-level lock.
With MySQL table-level locks, the timeout method must be used to
resolve deadlocks.

@section @code{InnoDB} Performance Tuning Tips

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the Unix @file{top} tool or the Windows @file{Task Manager} shows
that the CPU usage percentage with your workload is less than 70%,
your workload is probably
disk-bound. Maybe you are making too many transaction commits, or the
buffer pool is too small.
Making the buffer pool bigger can help, but do not set
it bigger than 80% of physical memory.

@item
Wrap several modifications into one transaction. @code{InnoDB} must
flush the log to disk at each transaction commit if that transaction
made modifications to the database. Since the rotation speed of a disk
is typically
at most 167 revolutions/second, that constrains the number of commits
to the same 167/second if the disk does not fool the operating system.

@item
If you can afford the loss of some latest committed transactions, you can
set the @file{my.cnf} parameter @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit}
to 0. @code{InnoDB} tries to flush the log once per second anyway,
although the flush is not guaranteed.

@item
Make your log files big, even as big as the buffer pool. When @code{InnoDB}
has written the log files full, it has to write the modified contents
of the buffer pool to disk in a checkpoint. Small log files will cause many
unnecessary disk writes. The drawback of big log files is that recovery
time will be longer.

@item
Make the log buffer quite big as well (say, 8MB).

@item
Use the @code{VARCHAR} column type instead of @code{CHAR} if you are
storing variable-length strings or if the column may contain many
@code{NULL} values. A @code{CHAR(N)} column always takes @code{N} bytes to
store data, even if the string is shorter, or its value is
@code{NULL}. Smaller tables fit better in the buffer pool and reduce
disk I/O.

@item
(Relevant from 3.23.39 up.)
In some versions of GNU/Linux and Unix, flushing files to disk with the
Unix @code{fsync()} and other similar methods is surprisingly slow.
The default method @code{InnoDB} uses is the @code{fsync()} function.
If you are not satisfied with the database write performance, you might
try setting @code{innodb_flush_method} in @file{my.cnf} to
@code{O_DSYNC}, though @code{O_DSYNC} seems to be slower on most
systems.

@item
When importing data into @code{InnoDB}, make sure that MySQL does not have
autocommit mode enabled because that would require a log flush to disk for
every insert.
To disable autocommit during your import operation, surround it with @code{SET
AUTOCOMMIT} and @code{COMMIT} statements:

@example
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;
/* SQL import statements ... */
COMMIT;
@end example

If you use the @code{mysqldump} option @code{--opt}, you will get dump
files that are fast to import into an @code{InnoDB} table, even without
wrapping them with the @code{SET AUTOCOMMIT} and @code{COMMIT} statements.

@item
Beware of big rollbacks of mass inserts: @code{InnoDB} uses the insert
buffer to save disk I/O in inserts, but no such mechanism is used in a
corresponding rollback.  A disk-bound rollback can take 30 times the time
of the corresponding insert. Killing the database process will not help
because the rollback will start again at the server startup. The only
way to get rid of a runaway rollback is to increase the buffer pool so that
the rollback becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or to use a special procedure.
@xref{Forcing recovery}.

@item
Beware also of other big disk-bound operations.
Use @code{DROP TABLE} or @code{TRUNCATE TABLE} (from MySQL 4.0 up) to empty a
table, not @code{DELETE FROM tbl_name}.

@item
Use the multiple-row @code{INSERT} syntax to reduce
communication overhead between the client and the server if you need
to insert many rows:

@example
INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES (1,2), (5,5), ...;
@end example

This tip is valid for inserts into any table type, not just @code{InnoDB}.

@item
If you have @code{UNIQUE} constraints on
secondary keys, starting from MySQL 3.23.52 and 4.0.3, you
can speed up table imports by temporarily turning off the uniqueness
checks during the import session:

@example
SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0;
@end example

For big tables, this saves a lot of disk I/O because @code{InnoDB} can
use its insert buffer to write secondary index records in a batch.

@item
If you have @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraints in your tables, starting
from MySQL 3.23.52 and 4.0.3, you can speed up table imports by turning the
foreign key checks off for a while in the import session:

@example
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
@end example

For big tables, this can save a lot of disk I/O.

@item
If you often have recurring queries to tables that are not
updated frequently, use the query cache available as of MySQL 4.0:

@example
[mysqld]
query_cache_type = ON
query_cache_size = 10M
@end example

In MySQL 4.0, the query cache works only with autocommit enabled. This
restriction is removed in MySQL 4.1.1 and up.

@end menu

@node InnoDB Monitor,  , InnoDB tuning, InnoDB tuning
@subsection @code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} and the @code{InnoDB} Monitors

Starting from MySQL 3.23.42, @code{InnoDB} includes @code{InnoDB} Monitors
that print information about the @code{InnoDB} internal state.  Starting from
MySQL 3.23.52 and 4.0.3, you can use the SQL statement @code{SHOW INNODB
STATUS} to fetch the output of the standard @code{InnoDB} Monitor to your
SQL client.  The information is useful in performance tuning. If you are
using the @code{mysql} interactive SQL client, the output is more readable
if you replace the usual semicolon statement terminator by @code{\G}:

@example
mysql> SHOW INNODB STATUS\G
@end example

Another way to use @code{InnoDB} Monitors is to let them continuously write
data to the standard output of the server @code{mysqld}.  In this case,
no output is sent to clients.  When switched on, @code{InnoDB} Monitors
print data about every 15 seconds. Server output usually is directed
to the @file{.err} log in the MySQL data directory.  This data is useful in
performance tuning.  On Windows, you must start the server from a command
prompt in a console window with the @code{--console} option if you want
to direct the output to the window rather than to the error log.

Monitor output includes information of the following types:

@itemize @bullet
@item Table and record locks held by each active transaction
@item Lock waits of a transactions
@item Semaphore waits of threads
@item Pending file I/O requests
@item Buffer pool statistics
@item Purge and insert buffer merge activity of the main @code{InnoDB} thread
@end itemize

To cause the standard @code{InnoDB} Monitor to write to the standard
output of @code{mysqld}, use the following SQL statement:

@example
CREATE TABLE innodb_monitor(a INT) TYPE=InnoDB;
@end example

The monitor can be stopped by issuing the following statement:

@example
DROP TABLE innodb_monitor;
@end example

The @code{CREATE TABLE} syntax is just a way to pass a command
to the @code{InnoDB} engine through the MySQL SQL parser: The only things
that matter are the table name @code{innodb_monitor} and that it be an
@code{InnoDB} table. The structure of the
table is not relevant at all for the @code{InnoDB} Monitor. If you shut down
the database when the monitor is running, and you want to start
the monitor again, you have to drop the
table before you can issue a new @code{CREATE TABLE}
statement to start the monitor.
This syntax may change in a future release.

In a similar way, you can start @code{innodb_lock_monitor}, which is
otherwise the same as @code{innodb_monitor} but also prints a
lot of lock information. A separate @code{innodb_tablespace_monitor}
prints a list of created file segments existing in the tablespace
and also validates the tablespace allocation data structures.
Starting from 3.23.44, there is @code{innodb_table_monitor} with which
you can print the contents of the @code{InnoDB} internal data dictionary.

A sample of @code{InnoDB} Monitor output:

@example

Some notes on the output:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the @code{TRANSACTIONS} section reports lock waits, your
application may have lock contention. The output can also help to
trace the reasons for transaction deadlocks.

@item
The @code{SEMAPHORES} section reports threads waiting for a semaphore and
statistics on how many times threads have needed a spin or a wait on a
mutex or a rw-lock semaphore. A large number of threads waiting for
semaphores may be a result of disk I/O, or contention problems inside
@code{InnoDB}. Contention can be due to heavy parallelism of queries, or
problems in operating system thread scheduling. Setting
@code{innodb_thread_concurrency} smaller than the default value of @code{8} can
help in such situations.

@item
The @code{BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY} section gives you statistics on pages
read and written. You can calculate from these numbers how many data
file I/O operations your queries currently are doing.

@node Implementation, Table and index, InnoDB tuning, InnoDB
@section Implementation of Multi-Versioning

Because @code{InnoDB} is a multi-versioned database, it must keep information
about old versions of rows in the tablespace. This information is stored
in a data structure called a rollback segment after an analogous
data structure in Oracle.

Internally, @code{InnoDB} adds two fields to each row stored in the database.
A 6-byte field indicates the transaction identifier for the last
transaction that inserted or updated the row. Also, a deletion
is treated internally as an update where a special bit in the row
is set to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte
field called the roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an
undo log record written to the rollback segment. If the row was
updated, the undo log record contains the information necessary
to rebuild the content of the row before it was updated.

@code{InnoDB} uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the
undo operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the
information to build earlier versions of a row for a consistent
read.

Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update
undo logs. Insert undo logs are needed only in transaction rollback
and can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs
are used also in consistent reads, and they can be discarded only after
there is no transaction present for which @code{InnoDB} has assigned
a snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information
in the update undo log to build an earlier version of a database
row.

You must remember to commit your transactions regularly, including those
transactions that only issue consistent reads.  Otherwise, @code{InnoDB}
cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the rollback segment
may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment
is typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated
row. You can use this information to calculate the space need
for your rollback segment.

In the @code{InnoDB} multi-versioning scheme, a row is not physically removed from
the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.
Only when @code{InnoDB} can discard the update undo log record written for
the deletion can it also physically remove the corresponding row and
its index records from the database. This removal operation is
called a purge, and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of
time as the SQL statement that did the deletion.


@node Table and index, File space management, Implementation, InnoDB
@section Table and Index Structures

MySQL stores its data dictionary information for tables in @file{.frm}
files in database directories. This is true for all MySQL storage engines.
But every @code{InnoDB} table
also has its own entry in @code{InnoDB} internal data dictionaries
inside the tablespace. When MySQL drops a table or a database,
it has to delete both an @file{.frm} file or files, and
the corresponding entries inside the @code{InnoDB} data dictionary.
This is the reason why you cannot move @code{InnoDB} tables between
databases simply by moving the @file{.frm} files. It is also the reason why
@code{DROP DATABASE} did not work for @code{InnoDB} type tables
before MySQL 3.23.44.

Every @code{InnoDB} table has a special index called the clustered index
where the data of the rows is stored. If you define a
@code{PRIMARY KEY} on your table, the index of the primary key
will be the clustered index.

If you do not define a @code{PRIMARY KEY} for
your table, MySQL picks the first @code{UNIQUE} index that has only
@code{NOT NULL} columns as the primary key and
@code{InnoDB} uses it as the clustered index.
If there is no such index in the table,
@code{InnoDB} internally generates a clustered index
where the rows are ordered by the row ID that @code{InnoDB} assigns
to the rows in such a table. The row ID is a 6-byte field that
increases monotonically as new rows are inserted. Thus the rows
ordered by the row ID will be physically in the insertion order.

Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast because the row data
will be on the same page where the index search leads.  If a table is large,
the clustered index architecture often saves a disk I/O when compared to
the traditional solution.  (In many databases, the data is traditionally
stored on a different page from the index record.)

In @code{InnoDB}, the records in non-clustered indexes (also called secondary
indexes) contain the primary key value for the row. @code{InnoDB} uses
this primary key value to search for the row from the clustered index. Note
that if the primary key is long, the secondary indexes use more space.

@code{InnoDB} compares @code{CHAR} and @code{VARCHAR} strings
of different lengths such that the remaining length in the shorter
string is treated as if padded with spaces.

@node InnoDB physical structure, InnoDB Insert buffering, Table and index, Table and index
@subsection Physical Structure of an Index

All indexes in @code{InnoDB} are B-trees where the index records are
stored in the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index
page is 16KB. When new records are inserted, @code{InnoDB} tries to
leave 1/16 of the page free for future insertions and updates
of the index records.

If index records are inserted in a sequential order (ascending or descending),
the resulting index pages will be about 15/16 full.
If records are inserted in a random order, the pages will be from
1/2 to 15/16 full. If the fillfactor of an index page drops below 1/2,
@code{InnoDB} tries to contract the index tree to free the page.


@node InnoDB Insert buffering, InnoDB Adaptive hash, InnoDB physical structure, Table and index
@subsection Insert Buffering

It is a common situation in a database application that the
primary key is a unique identifier and new rows are inserted in the
ascending order of the primary key. Thus the insertions to the
clustered index do not require random reads from a disk.

On the other hand, secondary indexes are usually non-unique, and insertions
into secondary indexes happen in a relatively random order.  This would
cause a lot of random disk I/O operations without a special mechanism used
in @code{InnoDB}.

If an index record should be inserted to a non-unique secondary index,
@code{InnoDB} checks whether the secondary index page is already in the buffer
pool. If that is the case, @code{InnoDB} does the insertion directly to
the index page. If the index page is not found in the buffer
pool, @code{InnoDB} inserts the record to a special insert buffer structure.
The insert buffer is kept so small that it fits entirely in the buffer
pool, and insertions can be done very fast.

Periodically, the insert buffer is merged into the secondary index trees in
the database. Often it is possible to merge several insertions to the same
page of the index tree, saving disk I/O operations.  It has been measured
that the insert buffer can speed up insertions into a table up to 15 times.


@node InnoDB Adaptive hash, InnoDB Physical record, InnoDB Insert buffering, Table and index
@subsection Adaptive Hash Indexes

If a table fits almost entirely in main memory, the fastest way
to perform queries on it is to use hash indexes. @code{InnoDB} has an
automatic mechanism that monitors index searches made to the indexes
defined for a table. If @code{InnoDB} notices that queries could
benefit from building a hash index, it does so automatically.

Note that the hash index is always built based on an existing
B-tree index on the table. @code{InnoDB} can build a hash index on a prefix
of any length of the key defined for the B-tree, depending on the
pattern of searches that @code{InnoDB} observes for the B-tree index.
A hash index can be partial: It is not required that the whole
B-tree index is cached in the buffer pool. @code{InnoDB} will build
hash indexes on demand for those pages of the index that are
often accessed.

In a sense, @code{InnoDB} adapts itself through the adaptive hash index mechanism
to ample main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main memory
databases.


@node InnoDB Physical record,  , InnoDB Adaptive hash, Table and index
@subsection Physical Record Structure

Records in @code{InnoDB} tables have the following characteristics:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each index record in @code{InnoDB} contains a header of six bytes. The header
is used to link consecutive records together, and also in row-level
locking.
@item
Records in the clustered index contain fields for all user-defined
columns. In addition, there is a six-byte field for the transaction ID
and a seven-byte field for the roll pointer.
@item
If no primary key was defined for a table, each clustered
index record also contains a six-byte row ID field.
@item
Each secondary index record contains also all the fields defined
for the clustered index key.
@item
A record contains also a pointer to each field of the record.
If the total length of the fields in a record is less than 128 bytes,
the pointer is one byte; otherwise, two bytes.
@item
Internally, @code{InnoDB} stores fixed-length character columns such as
@code{CHAR(10)} in a fixed-length format.
@code{InnoDB} truncates trailing spaces
from @code{VARCHAR} columns.
Note that MySQL may internally convert @code{CHAR} columns to
@code{VARCHAR}. @xref{Silent column changes}.
@item
An SQL @code{NULL} value reserves zero bytes if stored in a variable length
column. In a fixed-length column, it reserves the fixed length of the column.
The motivation behind reserving the fixed space for @code{NULL} values
is that then an update of the column from @code{NULL} to a
non-@code{NULL} value can be done in place and does not cause
fragmentation of the index page.

@node InnoDB Disk I/O, InnoDB Raw Devices, File space management, File space management
@subsection Disk I/O

@code{InnoDB} uses simulated asynchronous disk I/O: @code{InnoDB} creates a number of
threads to take care of I/O operations, such as read-ahead.

There are two read-ahead heuristics in @code{InnoDB}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In sequential read-ahead, if @code{InnoDB} notices that the access pattern to a
segment in the tablespace is sequential, it posts in
advance a batch of reads of database pages to the I/O system.
@item
In random read-ahead, if @code{InnoDB} notices that some area in a tablespace
seems to be in the process of being fully read into the buffer pool, it
posts the remaining reads to the I/O system.
@end itemize

Starting from MySQL 3.23.40b, @code{InnoDB} uses a novel file flush technique
called doublewrite.
It adds safety to crash recovery after an operating system crash
or a power outage, and improves performance on most Unix flavors
by reducing the need for @code{fsync()} operations.

Doublewrite means that before writing pages to a data file, @code{InnoDB}
first writes them to a contiguous tablespace area called the
doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite
buffer has completed does @code{InnoDB} write the pages to their proper
positions in the data file. If the operating system crashes in the
middle of a page write, @code{InnoDB} later will find a good
copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer during recovery.


@node InnoDB Raw Devices, InnoDB File space, InnoDB Disk I/O, File space management
@subsection Using Raw Devices for the Tablespace

Starting from MySQL 3.23.41, you can use raw disk partitions as tablespace
data files.
By using a raw disk, you can perform non-buffered I/O on Windows and on
some Unix systems without filesystem overhead, which might improve performance.

When you create a new data file, you must put the keyword @code{newraw}
immediately after the data file size in @code{innodb_data_file_path}.
The partition must be at least as large as the size that you specify.
Note that 1MB in @code{InnoDB} is 1024 * 1024 bytes, whereas 1MB usually
means 1,000,000 bytes in disk specifications.

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_home_dir=
innodb_data_file_path=/dev/hdd1:3Gnewraw;/dev/hdd2:2Gnewraw
@end example

The next time you start the server, @code{InnoDB} notices the @code{newraw}
keyword and initializes the new partition. However, do not create or change
any @code{InnoDB} tables yet. Otherwise, when you next restart the server,
@code{InnoDB} will reinitialize the partition and your changes will be lost.
(Starting from 3.23.44, as a safety measure @code{InnoDB} prevents users from
modifying data when any partition with @code{newraw} is specified.)

After @code{InnoDB} has initialized the new partition, stop the server, change
@code{newraw} in the data file specification to @code{raw}:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_home_dir=
innodb_data_file_path=/dev/hdd1:5Graw;/dev/hdd2:2Graw
@end example

Then restart the server and @code{InnoDB} will allow changes to be made.

On Windows, starting from 4.1.1, you can allocate a disk partition
as a data file like this:

@example
[mysqld]
innodb_data_home_dir=
innodb_data_file_path=//./D::10Gnewraw
@end example

The
@file{//./}
corresponds to the Windows syntax of
@file{\\.\}
for accessing physical drives.

When you use raw disk partitions, be sure that they have permissions that
allow read and write access by the account used for running the MySQL
server.


@node InnoDB File space, InnoDB File Defragmenting, InnoDB Raw Devices, File space management
@subsection File Space Management

The data files you define in the configuration file form the tablespace of
@code{InnoDB}. The files are simply concatenated to form the tablespace.
There is no striping in use.  Currently you cannot define where in the
tablespace your tables will be allocated. However, in a newly created
tablespace, @code{InnoDB} allocates space starting from the first
data file.

The tablespace consists of database pages with a default size of 16KB.
The pages are grouped into extents of 64 consecutive pages. The ``files''
inside a tablespace are called segments in @code{InnoDB}.
The name of the ``rollback segment'' is somewhat confusing because it
actually contains many segments in the tablespace.

Two segments are allocated for each index in @code{InnoDB}.  One is for
non-leaf nodes of the B-tree, the other is for the leaf nodes. The idea
here is to achieve better sequentiality for the leaf nodes, which contain
the data.

When a segment grows inside the tablespace, @code{InnoDB} allocates the
first 32 pages to it individually. After that @code{InnoDB} starts
to allocate whole extents to the segment.
@code{InnoDB} can add to a large segment up to 4 extents at a time to ensure
good sequentiality of data.

Some pages in the tablespace contain bitmaps of other pages, and
therefore a few extents in an @code{InnoDB} tablespace cannot be
allocated to segments as a whole, but only as individual pages.

When you ask for available free space in the tablespace by issuing
a @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS}, @code{InnoDB}
reports the extents that are definitely free in the tablespace.
@code{InnoDB} always reserves some extents for clean-up and other internal
purposes; these reserved extents are not included in the free space.

When you delete data from a table, @code{InnoDB} will contract the corresponding
B-tree indexes. It depends on the pattern of deletes whether that frees
individual pages or extents to the tablespace, so that the freed
space becomes available for other users. Dropping a table or deleting
all rows from it is guaranteed to release the space to other users,
but remember that deleted rows will be physically removed only in an
(automatic) purge operation after they are no longer needed in
transaction rollback or consistent read.


@node InnoDB File Defragmenting,  , InnoDB File space, File space management
@subsection Defragmenting a Table

If there are random insertions into or deletions from
the indexes of a table, the indexes
may become fragmented. Fragmentation means that the physical ordering
of the index pages on the disk is not close to the index ordering
of the records on the pages, or that there are many unused pages in the
64-page blocks that were allocated to the index.

It can speed up index scans if you periodically perform a ``null''
@code{ALTER TABLE} operation:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE=InnoDB
@end example

That causes MySQL to rebuild the table. Another way to perform a
defragmention operation is to use @code{mysqldump} to dump the table to a text
file, drop the table, and reload it from the dump file.

If the insertions to an index are always ascending and records are deleted
only from the end, the @code{InnoDB} file space management algorithm
guarantees that fragmentation in the index will not occur.

@node InnoDB Error handling, InnoDB restrictions, File space management, InnoDB
@section Error Handling

Error handling in @code{InnoDB} is not always the same as specified in the
SQL standard. According to the standard, any error during an SQL statement
should cause the rollback of that statement. @code{InnoDB} sometimes rolls
back only part of the statement, or the whole transaction.  The following
items describe how @code{InnoDB} performs error handling:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you run out of file space in the tablespace,
you will get the MySQL @code{Table is full} error
and @code{InnoDB} rolls back the SQL statement.
@item
A transaction deadlock or a timeout in a lock wait causes @code{InnoDB}
to roll back the whole transaction.
@item
A duplicate-key error rolls back only the insert of that particular row,
even in a statement like @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT}.
This will probably change so that the SQL statement will be rolled
back if you have not specified the @code{IGNORE} option in your
statement.
@item
A ``row too long'' error rolls back the SQL statement.
@item
Other errors are mostly detected by the MySQL layer of code (above the
@code{InnoDB} storage engine level), and
they roll back the corresponding SQL statement.

@section Restrictions on @code{InnoDB} Tables

@itemize @bullet

@item
A table cannot contain more than 1000 columns.

@item
The maximum key length is 1024 bytes.

@item
The maximum row length, except for @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns,
is slightly less than half of a database page, that is, the maximum row
length is about 8000 bytes. @code{LONGBLOB} and @code{LONGTEXT} columns
must be less than 4GB, and the total row length, including also @code{BLOB}
and @code{TEXT} columns, must be less than 4GB.  @code{InnoDB} stores
the first 512 bytes of a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} column in the row,
and the rest into separate pages.

@item
On some operating systems, data files must be less than 2GB.

@item
The combined size of the @code{InnoDB} log files must be less than 4GB.

@item
The minimum tablespace size is 10MB.
The maximum tablespace size is four billion database pages (64TB).
This is also the maximum size for a table.

@item
@code{InnoDB} tables do not support @code{FULLTEXT} indexes.

@item
On Windows, @code{InnoDB} always stores database and table names
internally in lowercase. To move databases in binary format
from Unix to Windows or from Windows to Unix, you should have all database
and table names in lowercase.

@item
@strong{Warning:} Do @emph{not} convert MySQL system tables in the
@code{mysql} database from
@code{MyISAM} to @code{InnoDB} tables!  This is an unsupported operation.
If you do this, MySQL
will not restart until you restore the old system tables from a backup
or re-generate them with the @code{mysql_install_db} script.

@item
@code{InnoDB} does not keep an internal count of rows in a table. (This
would actually be somewhat complicated because of multi-versioning.)
To process a @code{SELECT COUNT(*) FROM T} statement, @code{InnoDB} must
scan an index of the table, which will take some time if the table
is not entirely in the buffer pool. To get a fast count, you have to
use a counter table you create yourself and let your application
update it according to the inserts and deletes it does. If your table
does not change often, using the MySQL query cache is a good
solution.
@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} also can be used if an approximate row count is
sufficient.
@xref{InnoDB tuning}.

@item
For an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, you must always define an index for
the table, and that index must contain just the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
column. In @code{MyISAM} tables, the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column may
be part of a multi-column index.

@item
@code{InnoDB} does not support the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} table option for
setting the initial sequence value in a
@code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{ALTER TABLE} statement.
To set the value with @code{InnoDB}, insert a dummy row with a value
one less and delete that dummy row, or insert the first row with an
explicit value specified.

@item
When you restart the MySQL server, @code{InnoDB} may reuse an old
value for an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column (that is, a value that was
assigned to an old transaction that was rolled back).

@item
When an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column runs out of values, @code{InnoDB}
wraps a @code{BIGINT} to @code{-9223372036854775808} and @code{BIGINT
UNSIGNED} to @code{1}. However, @code{BIGINT} values have 64 bits, so do
note that if you were to insert one million rows per second, it would still
take about a million years before @code{BIGINT} reached its upper bound.
With all other integer type columns, a duplicate-key error will result.
This is similar to how @code{MyISAM} works, as it is mostly general MySQL
behavior and not about any storage engine in particular.

@item
@code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} does not regenerate the table but
instead deletes all rows, one by one.

@item
@code{TRUNCATE tbl_name} is mapped to @code{DELETE FROM tbl_name}
for @code{InnoDB} and doesn't reset the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} counter.

@item
@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} does not give accurate statistics
on @code{InnoDB} tables, except for the physical size reserved by the table.
The row count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization.

@item
If you try to create a unique index on a prefix of a column you will get an
error:

@example
CREATE TABLE T (A CHAR(20), B INT, UNIQUE (A(5))) TYPE = InnoDB;
@end example

If you create a non-unique index on a prefix of a column, @code{InnoDB} will
create an index over the whole column.

These restrictions are removed starting from 4.0.14 and 4.1.1.

@item
@code{INSERT DELAYED} is not supported for @code{InnoDB} tables.

@item
The MySQL @code{LOCK TABLES} operation does not know about @code{InnoDB}
row-level locks set by already completed SQL statements. This means that
you can get a table lock on a table even if there still exist transactions
by other users who have row level locks on the same table. Thus
your operations on the table may have to wait if they collide with
these locks of other users. Also a deadlock is possible. However,
this does not endanger transaction integrity, because the row level
locks set by @code{InnoDB} will always take care of the integrity.
Also, a table lock prevents other transactions from acquiring more
row level locks (in a conflicting lock mode) on the table.

@item
Before MySQL 3.23.52,
replication always ran with autocommit enabled. Therefore
consistent reads in the slave would also see partially processed
transactions, and thus the read would not be really consistent in the
slave. This restriction was removed in MySQL 3.23.52.

@item
The @code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} statement for setting up replication
slave servers does not yet work for @code{InnoDB} tables. A workaround
is to alter the table to @code{MyISAM} on the master, do then the load,
and after that alter the master table back to @code{InnoDB}.

@item
The default database page size in @code{InnoDB} is 16KB. By recompiling the
code, you can set it to values ranging from 8KB to 64KB.
You have to update the values of @code{UNIV_PAGE_SIZE} and
@code{UNIV_PAGE_SIZE_SHIFT} in the @file{univ.i} source file.

@end itemize

@section @code{InnoDB} Troubleshooting

@itemize @bullet
@item
A general rule is that when an operation fails or you suspect a bug,
you should look at the MySQL server error log, which
typically has a name something like @file{@var{hostname}.err}, or on
Windows @file{mysql.err}.

@item
When doing troubleshooting, it is usually best to run the MySQL server
from the command prompt, not through the
@code{mysqld_safe} wrapper or as a Windows service.
You will then see what @code{mysqld} prints to the command prompt
window, and you have a better grasp of what is going on.
On Windows, you must start the server with the @file{--console}
option to direct the output to the console window.

@item
Use the @code{InnoDB} Monitors to obtain information about a problem.
If the problem is performance-related, or your server appears to be
hung, you should use @code{innodb_monitor} to print information
about the internal state of @code{InnoDB}. If the problem is with locks, use
@code{innodb_lock_monitor}. If the problem is in creation of tables or
other data dictionary operations, use @code{innodb_table_monitor} to
print the contents of the @code{InnoDB} internal data dictionary.

@item
If you suspect a table is corrupt, run @code{CHECK TABLE} on that
table.

@subsection Troubleshooting @code{InnoDB} Data Dictionary Operations

A specific issue with tables is that the MySQL server keeps data
dictionary information in @file{.frm} files it stores in the database
directories, while @code{InnoDB} also stores the information into its own
data dictionary inside the tablespace files.
If you move @file{.frm} files around, or use @code{DROP DATABASE} in
MySQL versions before 3.23.44, or the server crashes in the middle of a
data dictionary operation, the @file{.frm} files may end up
out of sync with the @code{InnoDB} internal data dictionary.

A symptom of an out-of-sync data dictionary is that a @code{CREATE TABLE}
statement fails. If this occurs, you should look in the server's error
log. If the log says that the table already exists inside the @code{InnoDB}
internal data dictionary, you have an orphaned table inside the @code{InnoDB}
tablespace files that has no corresponding @file{.frm} file. The error message
looks like this:

@example
InnoDB: Error: table test/parent already exists in InnoDB internal
InnoDB: data dictionary. Have you deleted the .frm file
InnoDB: and not used DROP TABLE? Have you used DROP DATABASE
InnoDB: for InnoDB tables in MySQL version <= 3.23.43?
InnoDB: See the Restrictions section of the InnoDB manual.
InnoDB: You can drop the orphaned table inside InnoDB by
InnoDB: creating an InnoDB table with the same name in another
InnoDB: database and moving the .frm file to the current database.
InnoDB: Then MySQL thinks the table exists, and DROP TABLE will
InnoDB: succeed.
@end example

You can drop the orphaned table by following the instructions given in
the error message.

Another symptom of an out-of-sync data dictionary is that MySQL prints
an error that it cannot open an @file{.InnoDB} file:

@example
ERROR 1016: Can't open file: 'child2.InnoDB'. (errno: 1)
@end example

In the error log you will find a message like this:

@example
InnoDB: Cannot find table test/child2 from the internal data dictionary
InnoDB: of InnoDB though the .frm file for the table exists. Maybe you
InnoDB: have deleted and recreated InnoDB data files but have forgotten
InnoDB: to delete the corresponding .frm files of InnoDB tables?
@end example

This means that there is an orphaned @file{.frm} file without a
corresponding table inside @code{InnoDB}. You can drop the orphaned
@file{.frm} file by deleting it manually.

If MySQL crashes in the middle of an @code{ALTER TABLE} operation, you
may end up with an orphaned temporary table inside the @code{InnoDB}
tablespace. With @code{innodb_table_monitor} you see a table whose
name is @file{#sql...}, but since MySQL does not allow accessing any
table with such a name, you cannot dump or drop it. The solution is to
use a special mechanism available starting from MySQL 3.23.48.

When you have an orphaned table @file{#sql_id} inside the tablespace,
you can cause @code{InnoDB} to rename it to
@file{rsql_id_recover_innodb_tmp_table} with the following statement:

@example
CREATE TABLE `rsql_id_recover_innodb_tmp_table`(...) TYPE=InnoDB;
@end example

The backquotes around the table name are needed because a temporary
table name contains the character @samp{-}.

The table definition must be similar to that of the temporary table. If
you do not know the definition of the temporary table, you can use an
arbitrary definition in the preceding @code{CREATE TABLE} statement, and
after that replace the file @file{rsql_id.frm} by the file @file{#sql_id.frm}
of the temporary table.  Note that to copy or rename a file in the shell,
you need to put the file name in double quotes if the file name contains
@samp{#}. Then you can dump and drop the renamed table.

@section History of MaxDB

The  history of SAP DB goes back to the early 1980s when it was
developed as a commercial product (Adabas). The database has changed
names several times since then. When SAP AG, a company based in Walldorf, Germany,
took over the development of that database system,
it was called SAP DB.

SAP developed that database system to serve as a storage system
for all heavy-duty SAP applications, namely R/3. SAP DB was meant
to provide an alternative to third-party database systems such as
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and DB2 by IBM. In October 2000, SAP
AG released SAP DB under the GNU GPL license (@pxref{GPL license}), 
thus making it open source software. In October 2003, more than 2,000 
customers of SAP AG were using SAP DB as their main database system, 
and more than another 2,000 customers were using it as a separate 
database system besides their main database, as part of the 
APO/LiveCache solution.

In May 2003, a technology partnership was formed between MySQL AB
and SAP AG. That partnership entitles MySQL AB to further develop SAP
DB, rename it, and sell commercial licenses of the renamed SAP DB
to customers who do not want to be bound to the restrictions imposed
on them when using that database system under the GNU GPL (@pxref{GPL
license}). In August 2003, SAP DB was renamed MaxDB by MySQL AB.

@node MaxDB Licensing, MaxDB Links, MaxDB History, MaxDB
@section Licensing and Support

MaxDB can be used under the same licenses available for the other
products distributed by MySQL AB (@ref{MySQL licenses}). Thus,
MaxDB will be available under the GNU General Public License
(@ref{GPL license}), and a commercial license (@ref{Licensing
and Support}).

MySQL will offer MaxDB support to non-SAP customers.

The first rebranded version was MaxDB 7.5.00, which was
released in November 2003.

@c Licensing needs to be mentioned in 1.4.3 MySQL Licenses in greater detail.

@node MaxDB Basics, MaxDB-MySQL Differences, MaxDB Links, MaxDB
@section Basic Concepts of MaxDB

MaxDB operates as a client/server product. It was developed to meet
the demands of installations processing a high volume of online
transactions. Both online backup and expansion of the database are
supported. Microsoft Clustered Server is supported directly for
multiple server implementations; other failover solutions must be
scripted manually. Database management tools are provided in both
Windows and browser-based implementations.

@node MaxDB-MySQL Differences, MaxDB-MySQL Interoperability, MaxDB Basics, MaxDB
@section Feature Differences Between MaxDB and MySQL

The following list provides a short summary of the main differences
between MaxDB and MySQL; it is not complete.

@itemize @bullet
@item
MaxDB runs as a client/server system. MySQL can run as a client/server system
or as an embedded system.
@item
MaxDB might not run on all platforms supported by MySQL. For example,
MaxDB does not run on IBM's OS/2.
@item
MaxDB uses a proprietary network protocol for client/server
communication. MySQL uses either TCP/IP (with or without SSL
encryption), sockets (under Unix-like systems), or named pipes
(under Windows NT-family systems).
@item
MaxDB supports stored procedures. For MySQL, stored procedures are
implemented in version 5.0. MaxDB also supports programming of
triggers through an SQL extension, which is scheduled for MySQL
5.1. MaxDB contains a debugger for stored procedure languages,
can cascade nested triggers, and supports multiple triggers per
action and row.
@item
MaxDB is distributed with user interfaces that are text-based,
graphical, or Web-based. MySQL is distributed with text-based user
interfaces only; graphical user interface (MySQL Control Center, MySQL
Administrator)
are shipped separately from the main distributions. Web-based user
interfaces for MySQL are offered by third parties.
@item
MaxDB supports a number of programming interfaces that also are supported
by MySQL. However, MaxDB does not support RDO, ADO, or .NET, all of which are
supported by MySQL. MaxDB
supports embedded SQL only with C/C++.
@item
MaxDB includes administrative features that MySQL does not have:
job scheduling by time, event, and alert, and sending
messages to a database administrator on alert thresholds.

@c Maybe add table showing maxima for MaxDB and MySQL. Might be obtained from crash-me comparison.

@node MaxDB-MySQL Interoperability, MaxDB Reserved Words, MaxDB-MySQL Differences, MaxDB
@section Interoperability Features Between MaxDB and MySQL

The following features will be included in MaxDB versions to be
released shortly after the first 7.5.00 version. These features
will allow interoperation between MaxDB and MySQL.

@itemize @bullet
@item
There will be a MySQL proxy enabling connections to MaxDB using
the MySQL protocol. This makes it possible to use MySQL client
programs for MaxDB, such as the @code{mysql} command-line user interface,
the @code{mysqldump} dump utility, or the @code{mysqlimport} import
program. Using @code{mysqldump}, you can easily dump data from one
database system and export (or even pipe) those data to the other
database system.
@c For the utilities mentioned (and maybe for other utitilities as
@c well) it should be noted in the appropriate sections that they can
@c be used to communicate with the MaxDB server.
@item

Replication between MySQL and MaxDB will be supported in both
directions. That is, either MySQL or MaxDB can be used as the master
replication server. The long-range plan is to converge and extend the
replication syntax so that both database systems understand the same syntax.

@node MaxDB Reserved Words,  , MaxDB-MySQL Interoperability, MaxDB
@section Reserved Words in MaxDB

Like MySQL, MaxDB has a number of reserved words that have special meanings.
Normally, they cannot be used
as names of identifiers, such as database or table names. The following
table lists reserved words in MaxDB, indicates the context in which
those words are used, and indicates whether or not they have
counterparts in MySQL. If such a counterpart exists, the meaning
in MySQL might be identical or differing in some aspects. The main
purpose is to list in which respects MaxDB differs from MySQL;
therefore, this list is not complete.

@cindex Spatial Extensions in MySQL

@cindex GIS
@cindex OpenGIS

MySQL implements spatial extensions following the specification of
the @code{Open GIS Consortium} (OGC). This is an international consortium
of more than 250 companies, agencies, and universities participating
in the development of publicly available conceptual solutions that can be
useful with all kinds of applications that manage spatial data.
The OGC maintains a Web site at @uref{http://www.opengis.org/}.

In 1997, the Open GIS Consortium published the
@cite{OpenGIS (R) Simple Features Specifications For SQL}, a document that
proposes several conceptual ways for extending an SQL RDBMS to support spatial
data. This specification is available from the Open GIS Web site at
@url{http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf}.
It contains additional information relevant to this chapter.

MySQL implements a subset of the @strong{SQL with Geometry Types}
environment proposed by OGC.
This term refers to an SQL environment that has been extended with a
set of geometry types. A geometry-valued SQL column is implemented as
a column that has a geometry type. The specifications describe a set of SQL
geometry types, as well as functions on those types to create and
analyze geometry values.

@cindex geographic feature

A @strong{geographic feature} is anything in the world that has a location.
A feature can be:

@itemize @bullet
@item
An entity. For example, a mountain, a pond, a city.
@item
A space. For example, a postcode area, the tropics.
@item
A definable location. For example, a crossroad,
as a particular place where two streets intersect.
@end itemize

@cindex geospatial feature

You can also find documents that use the term @strong{geospatial feature} to
refer to geographic features.

@cindex geometry

@strong{Geometry} is another word that denotes a geographic feature.
Originally the word @strong{geometry} meant measurement of the earth.
Another meaning comes from cartography, referring to the geometric
features that cartographers use to map the world.

This chapter uses all of these terms synonymously:
@strong{geographic feature}, @strong{geospatial feature},
@strong{feature}, or @strong{geometry}.
The term most commonly used here is @strong{geometry}.

Let's define a @strong{geometry} as @emph{a point or an aggregate of
points representing anything in the world that has a location}.

@section The OpenGIS Geometry Model

The set of geometry types proposed by OGC's @strong{SQL with Geometry Types}
environment is based on the @strong{OpenGIS Geometry Model}. In this model,
each geometric object has the following general properties:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It is associated with a Spatial Reference System, which describes the
coordinate space in which the object is defined.
@item
It belongs to some geometry class.

@subsection The Geometry Class Hierarchy

The geometry classes define a hierarchy as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{Geometry} (non-instantiable)
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{Point} (instantiable)

@item @code{Curve} (non-instantiable)
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{LineString} (instantiable)
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{Line}
@item @code{LinearRing}

@item @code{MultiSurface} (non-instantiable)
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{MultiPolygon} (instantiable)
@end itemize
@end itemize

@end itemize
@end itemize

It is not possible to create objects in non-instantiable classes.
It is possible to create objects in instantiable classes.
All classes have properties, and instantiable classes may also
have assertions (rules that define valid class instances).

@c help_category Geographic features
@c description_for_help_topic Geometry hierarchy
@code{Geometry} is the base class. It's an abstract class.
The instantiable subclasses of @code{Geometry} are restricted to zero-, one-,
and two-dimensional geometric objects that exist in
two-dimensional coordinate space. All instantiable geometry classes are
defined so that valid instances of a geometry class are topologically closed
(that is, all defined geometries include their boundary).

The base @code{Geometry} class has subclasses for @code{Point},
@code{Curve}, @code{Surface}, and @code{GeometryCollection}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{Point} represents zero-dimensional objects.

@item
@code{Curve} represents one-dimensional objects, and has subclass
@code{LineString}, with sub-subclasses @code{Line} and @code{LinearRing}.

@item
@code{Surface} is designed for two-dimensional objects and
has subclass @code{Polygon}.

@item
@code{GeometryCollection}
has specialized zero-, one-, and two-dimensional collection classes named
@code{MultiPoint}, @code{MultiLineString}, and @code{MultiPolygon}
for modeling geometries corresponding to collections of
@code{Points}, @code{LineStrings}, and @code{Polygons}, respectively.
@code{MultiCurve} and @code{MultiSurface} are introduced as abstract superclasses
that generalize the collection interfaces to handle @code{Curves} and @code{Surfaces}.

@end itemize

@code{Geometry}, @code{Curve}, @code{Surface}, @code{MultiCurve},
and @code{MultiSurface} are defined as non-instantiable classes.
They define a common set of methods for their subclasses and
are included for extensibility.

@code{Point}, @code{LineString}, @code{Polygon}, @code{GeometryCollection},
@code{MultiPoint}, @code{MultiLineString}, and
@code{MultiPolygon} are instantiable classes.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@node GIS class geometry, GIS class point, GIS geometry class hierarchy, OpenGIS geometry model
@subsection Class @code{Geometry}

@code{Geometry} is the root class of the hierarchy.  It is a
non-instantiable class but has a number of properties that are common to
all geometry values created from any of the @code{Geometry} subclasses.
These properties are described in the following list.  (Particular
subclasses have their own specific properties, described later.)


@subsubheading Geometry Properties

A geometry value has the following properties:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Its @strong{type}.
Each geometry belongs to one of the instantiable classes in the hierarchy.

@item
Its @strong{SRID}, or Spatial Reference Identifier. This value identifies
the geometry's associated Spatial Reference System that describes the
coordinate space in which the geometry object is defined.

@item
Its @strong{coordinates} in its Spatial Reference System,
represented as double-precision (eight-byte) numbers. All non-empty geometries
include at least one pair of (X,Y) coordinates. Empty geometries contain
no coordinates.

Coordinates are related to the SRID.
For example, in different coordinate systems, the distance between two objects
may differ even when objects have the same coordinates, because the distance
on the @strong{planar} coordinate system and the distance on the @strong{geocentric}
system (coordinates on the Earth's surface) are different things.

@item
Its @strong{interior}, @strong{boundary}, and @strong{exterior}.
@c help_category MBR@Geographic features
@c description_for_help_topic MBR definition
Every geometry occupies some position in space. The exterior of
a geometry is all space not occupied by the geometry. The interior
is the space occupied by the geometry. The boundary is the
interface between the geometry's interior and exterior.

@item
Its @strong{MBR} (Minimum Bounding Rectangle), or Envelope.
This is the bounding geometry, formed by the minimum and maximum (X,Y)
coordinates:
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@c example_for_help_topic MBR definition
@example
((MINX MINY, MAXX MINY, MAXX MAXY, MINX MAXY, MINX MINY))
@end example

@item
The quality of being @strong{simple} or @strong{non-simple}.
Geometry values of types (@code{LineString}, @code{MultiPoint},
@code{MultiLineString})
are either simple or non-simple. Each type determines its own assertions
for being simple or non-simple.

@item
The quality of being @strong{closed} or @strong{not closed}.
Geometry values of types (@code{LineString}, @code{MultiString}) are
either closed
or not closed. Each type determines its own assertions for being closed
or not closed.

@item
The quality of being @strong{empty} or @strong{not empty}
A geometry is empty if it does not have any points.
Exterior, interior, and boundary of an empty geometry
are not defined (that is, they are represented by a @code{NULL} value).
An empty geometry is defined to be always simple and has an area of 0.

@item
Its @strong{dimension}. A geometry can have a dimension of @minus{}1, 0, 1,
or 2:

@itemize @bullet

@item @minus{}1 for an empty geometry.

@item 0 for a geometry with no length and no area.

@item 1 for a geometry with non-zero length and zero area.

@item 2 for a geometry with non-zero area.

@end itemize

@code{Point} objects have a dimension of zero.  @code{LineString}
objects have a dimension of 1. @code{Polygon} objects have a
dimension of 2.  The dimensions of @code{MultiPoint},
@code{MultiLineString}, and @code{MultiPolygon} objects are the
same as the dimensions of the elements they consist of.

@node GIS WKB format,  , GIS WKT format, Supported spatial data formats
@subsection Well-Known Binary (WKB) Format

@cindex WKB format
@cindex Well-Known Binary format

The Well-Known Binary (WKB) representation for geometric values is defined by
the OpenGIS specifications.
It is also defined in the ISO ``SQL/MM Part 3: Spatial'' standard.

WKB is used to exchange geometry data as binary streams represented by
@code{BLOB} values containing geometric WKB information.

WKB uses one-byte unsigned integers, four-byte unsigned integers, and eight-byte
double-precision numbers (IEEE 754 format). A byte is eight bits.

For example, a WKB value that corresponds to @code{POINT(1 1)} consists of
this sequence of 21 bytes (each represented here by two hex digits):

@example
0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F
@end example

The sequence may be broken down into these components:

@example
Byte order : 01
WKB type   : 01000000
X          : 000000000000F03F
Y          : 000000000000F03F
@end example

Component representation is as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The byte order may be either 0 or 1 to indicate little-endian or big-endian
storage. The little-endian and big-endian byte orders are also known as
Network Data Representation (NDR) and External Data Representation (XDR),
respectively.

@item
The WKB type is a code that indicates the geometry type. Values from 1 through
7 indicate
@code{Point},
@code{LineString},
@code{Polygon},
@code{MultiPoint},
@code{MultiLineString},
@code{MultiPolygon},
and
@code{GeometryCollection}.

@item
A @code{Point} value has X and Y coordinates, each represented as a
double-precision value.

@end itemize

WKB values for more complex geometry values are represented by more complex
data structures, as detailed in the OpenGIS specification.

@subsubsection Creating Geometry Values Using WKT Functions

MySQL provides a number of functions that take as input parameters a
Well-Known Text representation and, optionally, a spatial reference
system identifier (SRID). They return the corresponding geometry.

@code{GeomFromText()} accepts a WKT of any geometry type as its first
argument.  An implementation also provides type-specific construction
functions for construction of geometry values of each geometry type.

@subsubsection Creating Geometry Values Using MySQL-Specific Functions

@strong{Note:} MySQL does not implement the functions listed in this
section.

@subsection Creating Spatial Columns

@c help_category Geographic features

@c description_for_help_topic GEOMETRY
MySQL provides a standard way of creating spatial columns for
geometry types, for example, with @code{CREATE TABLE} or @code{ALTER TABLE}.
Currently, spatial columns are supported only for @code{MyISAM} tables.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@itemize @bullet

@item
Use the @code{CREATE TABLE} statement to create a table with a spatial column:

@c example_for_help_topic GEOMETRY
@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
@end example

@item
Use the @code{ALTER TABLE} statement to add or drop a spatial column to or
from an existing table:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE geom ADD pt POINT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
mysql> ALTER TABLE geom DROP pt;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
@end example

@end itemize


@node Populating spatial columns, Fetching spatial data, Creating spatial columns, Creating a spatially enabled MySQL database
@subsection Populating Spatial Columns

After you have created spatial columns, you can populate them
with spatial data.

Values should be stored in internal geometry format, but you can convert them
to that format from either Well-Known Text (WKT) or Well-Known Binary (WKB)
format. The following examples demonstrate how to insert geometry values into
a table by converting WKT values into internal geometry format.

You can perform the conversion directly in the @code{INSERT} statement:

@example
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)'));

SET @@g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@@g));
@end example

Or you can perform the conversion prior to the @code{INSERT}:

@example
SET @@g = GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)');
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (@@g);
@end example

The following examples insert more complex geometries into the table:

@example
SET @@g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@@g));

SET @@g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@@g));

SET @@g =
'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromText(@@g));
@end example

The preceding examples all use @code{GeomFromText()} to create geometry
values.  You can also use type-specific functions:

@example
SET @@g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (PointFromText(@@g));

SET @@g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (LineStringFromText(@@g));

SET @@g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (PolygonFromText(@@g));

SET @@g =
'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomCollFromText(@@g));
@end example

Note that if a client application program wants to use WKB representations
of geometry values, it is responsible for sending correctly formed WKB in
queries to the server. However, there are several ways of satisfying this
requirement. For example:

@itemize @bullet

@item Inserting a @code{POINT(1 1)} value with hex literal syntax:
@example
mysql> INSERT INTO geom VALUES
    -> (GeomFromWKB(0x0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F));
@end example

@item An ODBC application can send a WKB representation, binding it to a
placeholder using an argument of @code{BLOB} type:
@example
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (GeomFromWKB(?))
@end example

Other programming interfaces may support a similar placeholder mechanism.

@item In a C program, you can escape a binary value using
@code{mysql_real_escape_string()} and include the result in a query string
that is sent to the server.
@xref{mysql_real_escape_string, , @code{mysql_real_escape_string()}}.

@node Optimising spatial analysis, MySQL GIS conformance and compatibility, Analysing spatial information, Spatial extensions in MySQL
@section Optimizing Spatial Analysis

Search operations in non-spatial databases can be optimized
using indexes. This is true for spatial databases as well.
With the help of a great variety of multi-dimensional indexing methods that
have already been designed, it is possible to optimize
spatial searches. The most typical of these are:

@itemize @bullet

@item Point queries that search for all objects that contain a given point

@item Region queries that search for all objects that overlap a given region

@end itemize

MySQL uses @strong{R-Trees with quadratic splitting} to index
spatial columns. A spatial index is built using the MBR of a geometry.
For most geometries, the MBR is a minimum rectangle that
surrounds the geometries. For a horizontal or a vertical
linestring, the MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the linestring.
For a point, the MBR is a rectangle degenerated into the point.

@subsection Creating Spatial Indexes

@c help_category Geographic features
@c description_for_help_topic SPATIAL  INDEX TABLE ALTER CREATE ADD KEY
MySQL can create spatial indexes using syntax similar to that for creating
regular indexes, but extended with the @code{SPATIAL} keyword.
Spatial columns that are indexed currently must be declared @code{NOT NULL}.
The following examples demonstrate how to create spatial indexes.

@itemize @bullet

@item With @code{CREATE TABLE}:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL, SPATIAL INDEX(g));
@end example

@item With @code{ALTER TABLE}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);
@end example

@item With @code{CREATE INDEX}:

@example
mysql> CREATE SPATIAL INDEX sp_index ON geom (g);
@end example

@end itemize

To drop spatial indexes, use @code{ALTER TABLE} or @code{DROP INDEX}:

@itemize @bullet

@item With @code{ALTER TABLE}:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE geom DROP INDEX g;
@end example

@item With @code{DROP INDEX}:

@example
mysql> DROP INDEX sp_index ON geom;
@end example

@end itemize

Example: Suppose that a table @code{geom} contains more than 32,000 geometries,
which are stored in the column @code{g} of type @code{GEOMETRY}.
The table also has an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column @code{fid} for storing
object ID values.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

@example
mysql> DESCRIBE geom;
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| fid   | int(11)  |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| g     | geometry |      |     |         |                |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM geom;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    32376 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example


To add a spatial index on the column @code{g}, use this statement:
@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);
Query OK, 32376 rows affected (4.05 sec)
Records: 32376  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
@end example


@node Using a spatial index,  , Creating spatial indexes, Optimising spatial analysis
@subsection Using a Spatial Index

The optimizer investigates whether available spatial indexes can
be involved in the search for queries that use a function such as
@code{MBRContains()} or @code{MBRWithin()} in the @code{WHERE} clause.
For example, let's say we want to find all objects that are in the
given rectangle:

@example
mysql> SELECT fid,AsText(g) FROM geom WHERE

OpenGIS specifications propose several additional metadata views.
For example, a system view named @code{GEOMETRY_COLUMNS} contains a
description of geometry columns, one row for each geometry column
in the database.

@c @item Functions to add/drop spatial columns
@c OpenGIS assumes that columns can be added or dropped using special
@c @code{AddGeometryColumn()} and @code{DropGeometryColumn()}
@c functions. In MySQL, this is done using the @code{ALTER TABLE},
@c @code{CREATE INDEX}, and @code{DROP INDEX} statements instead.

@c @item Factors related to Spatial Reference Systems and their IDs (SRIDs):

@c @itemize @bullet

@c @item
@c Functions like @code{Length()} and @code{Area()} assume a planar

@c All objects currently are considered to be in the same planar
@c coordinate system.

@c @end itemize

@item The OpenGIS function @code{Length()} on @code{LineString} and @code{MultiLineString} currently should be called in MySQL as @code{GLength()}
The problem is that there is an existing SQL function
@code{Length()} which calculates the length of string values,
and sometimes it is not possible to distinguish whether the function is
called in a textual or spatial context. We need either to solve this
somehow, or decide on another function name.

@node Stored Procedures, Clients, Spatial extensions in MySQL, Top
@chapter Stored Procedures and Functions

@cindex stored procedures
@cindex procedures, stored

Stored procedures and functions are a new feature in MySQL version 5.0.
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the server.
Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep reissuing the individual
statements but can refer to the stored procedure instead.

Stored procedures can provide improved performance because less information
needs to be sent between the server and the client. The tradeoff is that
this does increase the load on the database server system because more of
the work is done on the server side and less is done on the client
(application) side. And, often, there are multiple client machines (such as
Web servers) but only one or a few database servers.

Stored procedures also allow you to have libraries of functions in the
database server. However, modern application languages
already allow such design internally with, for example, classes. Using
these client application language features is beneficial for the programmer
even outside the scope of database use.

Some situations where stored procedures can be particularly useful:
@itemize @bullet
@item
When multiple client applications are written in different languages or work
on different platforms, but need to perform the same database operations.
@item
When security is paramount. Banks, for example, use stored procedures for
all common operations. This provides a consistent and secure environment,
and procedures can ensure that each operation is properly logged.
In such a setup, applications and users would not get any access to the
database tables directly, but can only execute specific stored procedures.
@end itemize

MySQL follows the SQL:2003 syntax for stored procedures, which is also used
by IBM's DB2.

The MySQL implementation of stored procedures is still in progress. All
syntax described in this chapter is supported and any limitations and
extensions are documented where appropriate.

Stored procedures require the @code{proc} table in the @code{mysql} database.
This table is created during the MySQL 5.0 installation procedure.
If you are upgrading to MySQL 5.0 from an earlier version, be sure to update
your grant tables to make sure that the @code{proc} table exists.
@xref{Upgrading-grant-tables}.


@menu

@end menu

@node Stored Procedure Syntax,  , Stored Procedures, Stored Procedures
@section Stored Procedure Syntax

Stored procedures and functions are routines that are created with
@code{CREATE PROCEDURE} and @code{CREATE FUNCTION} statements.
A procedure is invoked using a @code{CALL} statement, and can only
pass back values using output variables.  Functions may return a
scalar value and can be called from inside a statement just like any other
function (that is, by invoking the function's name).
Stored routines may call other stored routines. A routine is either a
procedure or a function.

At present, MySQL only preserves context for the default database. That is,
if you say @code{USE db_name} within a procedure, the original default
database is restored upon routine exit.
A routine inherits the default database from the caller, so generally routines
should either issue a @code{USE db_name} statement, or specify all tables
with an explicit database reference; for example, @code{db_name.tbl_name}.

MySQL supports the very useful extension that allows the use of regular
@code{SELECT} statements (that is, without using cursors or local variables)
inside a stored procedure. The result set of such a query is simply sent
directly to the client.
Multiple @code{SELECT} statements generate multiple result sets, so the client
must use a MySQL client library that supports multiple result sets. This means
the client must use a client library from a version of MySQL at least as
recent as 4.1.

This following section describes the syntax used to create, alter, drop, and
query stored procedures and functions.

@subsubsection @code{CREATE PROCEDURE} and @code{CREATE FUNCTION}

@findex CREATE PROCEDURE
@findex CREATE FUNCTION

@example
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_name ([parameter[,...]])
    [characteristic ...] routine_body

CREATE FUNCTION sp_name ([parameter[,...]])
    [RETURNS type]
    [characteristic ...] routine_body

parameter:
    [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] param_name type

type:
    Any valid MySQL data type

characteristic:
    LANGUAGE SQL
  | [NOT] DETERMINISTIC
  | SQL SECURITY @{DEFINER | INVOKER@}
  | COMMENT string

routine_body:
    Valid SQL procedure statement(s)
@end example

The @code{RETURNS} clause may be specified only for a @code{FUNCTION}.
It is used to indicate the return type of the function, and the function
body must contain a @code{RETURN value} statement.

The parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.
If there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of @code{()} should
be used.  Each parameter is an @code{IN} parameter by default. To specify
otherwise for a parameter, use the keyword @code{OUT} or @code{INOUT} before
the parameter name. Specifying @code{IN}, @code{OUT}, or @code{INOUT} is only
valid for a @code{PROCEDURE}.

The @code{CREATE FUNCTION} statement is used in
earlier versions of MySQL to support UDFs (User Defined Functions).
@xref{Adding functions}.
UDFs continue to be supported, even with the existence of stored functions.
A UDF can be regarded as an external stored function.  However, do
note that stored functions share their namespace with UDFs.

A framework for external stored procedures will be introduced in the near
future. This will allow you to write stored procedures in languages other
than SQL.
Most likely, one of the first languages to be supported will be PHP because the
core PHP engine is small, thread-safe, and can easily be embedded. Because the
framework will be public, it is expected that many other languages will also
be supported.

A function is considered ``deterministic'' if it always returns the same
result for the same input parameters, and ``not deterministic'' otherwise.
Currently, the @code{DETERMINISTIC} characteristic is accepted, but not yet
used by the optimizer.

The @code{SQL SECURITY} characteristic can be used to specify whether the
routine should be executed using the permissions of the user who creates
the routine or the user who invokes it.
The default value is @code{DEFINER}.
This feature is new in SQL:2003.

MySQL does not yet use the @code{GRANT EXECUTE} privilege.

MySQL stores the @code{sql_mode} system variable setting that is in effect
at the time a routine is created, and will always execute the routine with
this setting in force.

The @code{COMMENT} clause is a MySQL extension, and may be used to describe
the stored procedure. This information is displayed by the
@code{SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE} and @code{SHOW CREATE FUNCTION} statements.

MySQL allows routines to contain DDL statements (such as @code{CREATE} and
 @code{DROP}) and SQL transaction statements (such as @code{COMMIT}). This is
not required by the standard and is therefore implementation-specific.

@strong{Note:}
Currently, stored functions created with @code{CREATE FUNCTION} may not contain references to tables.
Please note that this includes some @code{SET} statements, but excludes some
@code{SELECT} statements.
This limitation will be lifted as soon as possible.

The following is an example of a simple stored procedure that uses
an @code{OUT} parameter.
The example uses the @code{mysql} client @code{delimiter} command to change
the statement delimiter from @code{;} to @code{//} while the procedure is
being defined.
This allows the @code{;} delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed
through to the server rather than being interpreted by @code{mysql} itself.

@example
mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)
    -> BEGIN
    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t;
    -> END
    -> //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

mysql> CALL simpleproc(@@a);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @@a;
+------+
| @@a   |
+------+
| 3    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example


The following is an example of a function that takes a parameter,
performs an operation using an SQL function, and returns the result:

@example
mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20)) RETURNS CHAR(50)
    -> RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');
    -> //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter ;

mysql> SELECT hello('world');
+----------------+

+----------------+
| Hello, world!  |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

@findex ALTER FUNCTION

@example
ALTER @{PROCEDURE | FUNCTION@} sp_name [characteristic ...]

characteristic:
    NAME new_name
  | SQL SECURITY @{DEFINER | INVOKER@}
  | COMMENT string
@end example

This statement can be used to rename a stored procedure or function, and to
change its characteristics. More than one change may be specified in an
@code{ALTER PROCEDURE} or @code{ALTER FUNCTION} statement.


@node DROP PROCEDURE, SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE, ALTER PROCEDURE, Maintaining Stored Procedures
@subsubsection @code{DROP PROCEDURE} and @code{DROP FUNCTION}

@findex DROP PROCEDURE
@findex DROP FUNCTION

@example
DROP @{PROCEDURE | FUNCTION@} [IF EXISTS] sp_name
@end example

This statement is used to drop a stored procedure or function. That is, the
specified routine is removed from the server.

The @code{IF EXISTS} clause is a MySQL extension.
It prevents an error from occurring if the procedure or function does not
exist. A warning is produced that can be viewed with @code{SHOW WARNINGS}.


@node SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE,  , DROP PROCEDURE, Maintaining Stored Procedures
@subsubsection @code{SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE} and @code{SHOW CREATE FUNCTION}

@findex SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE
@findex SHOW CREATE FUNCTION

@example
SHOW CREATE @{PROCEDURE | FUNCTION@} sp_name
@end example

This statement is a MySQL extension. Similar to @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}, it
returns the exact string that can be used to re-create the named routine.


@node SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS, CALL, Maintaining Stored Procedures, Stored Procedure Syntax
@subsection @code{SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS} and @code{SHOW FUNCTION STATUS}

@findex SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS
@findex SHOW FUNCTION STATUS

@example
SHOW @{PROCEDURE | FUNCTION@} STATUS [LIKE 'pattern']
@end example

This statement is a MySQL extension. It returns characteristics of routines,
such as the name, type, creator, and creation and modification dates. If no
pattern is specified, the information for all stored procedures or all stored
functions is listed, depending on which statement you use.


@node CALL, BEGIN END, SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS, Stored Procedure Syntax
@subsection @code{CALL}

@findex CALL

@example
CALL sp_name([parameter[,...]])
@end example

The @code{CALL} statement is used to invoke a routine that was defined
previously with @code{CREATE PROCEDURE}.


@node BEGIN END, DECLARE, CALL, Stored Procedure Syntax
@subsection @code{BEGIN ... END} Compound Statement

@findex BEGIN
@findex END

@example
[begin_label:] BEGIN
    statement(s)
END [end_label]
@end example

Stored routines may contain multiple statements, using a
@code{BEGIN ... END} compound statement.

@code{begin_label} and @code{end_label} must be the same, if both are
specified.

Please note that the optional @code{[NOT] ATOMIC} clause is not yet
supported. This means that no transactional savepoint is set at the start of
the instruction block and the @code{BEGIN} clause used in this context has
no effect on the current transaction.

Using multiple statements requires that a client is able to send query
strings containing the @code{;} statement delimiter. This is handled in the
@code{mysql} command-line client with the @code{delimiter} command. Changing
the @code{;} end-of-query delimiter (for example, to @code{//}) allows
@code{;} to be used in a routine body.

@subsection @code{DECLARE} Statement

@findex DECLARE

The @code{DECLARE} statement is used to define various items local to a
routine:
local variables (@pxref{Variables in Stored Procedures}),
conditions and handlers (@pxref{Conditions and Handlers}) and
cursors (@pxref{Cursors}).
@code{SIGNAL} and @code{RESIGNAL} statements are not currently supported.

@code{DECLARE} may be used only inside a @code{BEGIN ... END} compound
statement and must be at its start, before any other statements.

@node SET Statement, SELECT INTO Statement, DECLARE Local Variables, Variables in Stored Procedures
@subsubsection Variable @code{SET} Statement

@findex SET

@example
SET var_name = expression [,...]
@end example

The @code{SET} statement in stored procedures is an extended version of
the general @code{SET} statement. Referenced variables may be ones declared
inside a routine, or global server variables.

The @code{SET} statement in stored procedures is implemented as part of the
pre-existing @code{SET} syntax. This allows an extended syntax of
@code{SET a=x, b=y, ...} where different variable types (locally declared
variables, server variables, and global and session server variables) can be
mixed. This also allows combinations of local variables and some options
that make sense only for global/system variables; in that case, the options
are accepted but ignored.


@node SELECT INTO Statement,  , SET Statement, Variables in Stored Procedures
@subsubsection @code{SELECT ... INTO} Statement

@findex SELECT INTO

@example
SELECT col_name[,...] INTO var_name[,...] table_expression
@end example

This @code{SELECT} syntax stores selected columns directly into variables.
Therefore, only a single row may be retrieved. This statement is also
extremely useful when used in combination with cursors.

@example
SELECT id,data INTO x,y FROM test.t1 LIMIT 1;
@end example


@node Conditions and Handlers, Cursors, Variables in Stored Procedures, Stored Procedure Syntax
@subsection Conditions and Handlers

Certain conditions may require specific handling. These conditions can relate
to errors, as well as general flow control inside a routine.

@cindex Conditions

@example
DECLARE condition_name CONDITION FOR condition_value

condition_value:
    SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value
  | mysql_error_code
@end example

This statement specifies conditions that will need
specific handling. It associates a name with a specified error
condition. The name can subsequently be used in a
@code{DECLARE HANDLER} statement. @xref{DECLARE Handlers}.

In addition to SQLSTATE values, MySQL error codes are also supported.


@node DECLARE Handlers,  , DECLARE Conditions, Conditions and Handlers
@subsubsection @code{DECLARE} Handlers

@cindex Handlers

@example
DECLARE handler_type HANDLER FOR condition_value[,...] sp_statement

handler_type:

  | EXIT
  | UNDO

condition_value:
    SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value
  | condition_name
  | SQLWARNING
  | NOT FOUND
  | SQLEXCEPTION
  | mysql_error_code
@end example

This statement specifies handlers that each may deal with
one or more conditions. If one of these conditions occurs, the specified
statement is executed.

For a @code{CONTINUE} handler, execution of the current routine continues
after execution of the handler statement.
For an @code{EXIT} handler, execution of the current @code{BEGIN...END}
compound statement is terminated.
The @code{UNDO} @code{handler_type} statement is not yet supported.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{SQLWARNING} is shorthand for all SQLSTATE codes that begin with @code{01}.
@item
@code{NOT FOUND} is shorthand for all SQLSTATE codes that begin with @code{02}.
@item
@code{SQLEXCEPTION} is shorthand for all SQLSTATE codes not caught by
@code{SQLWARNING} or @code{NOT FOUND}.
@end itemize

In addition to SQLSTATE values, MySQL error codes are also supported.


For example:

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE test.t (s1 int,primary key (s1));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> delimiter //

mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE handlerdemo ()
    -> BEGIN
    ->   DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET @@x2 = 1;
    ->   SET @@x = 1;
    ->   INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
    ->   SET @@x = 2;
    ->   INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);
    ->   SET @@x = 3;
    -> END;
    -> //
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CALL handlerdemo()//
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT @@x//
    +------+
    | @@x   |
    +------+
    | 3    |
    +------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

Notice that @code{@@x} is @code{3}, which shows that MySQL executed to the end of
the procedure. If the line
@code{DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '23000' SET @@x2 = 1;}
had not been present, MySQL would have taken the default (@code{EXIT}) path
after the second @code{INSERT} failed due to the @code{PRIMARY KEY}
constraint, and @code{SELECT @@x} would have returned @code{2}.


@node Cursors, Flow Control Constructs, Conditions and Handlers, Stored Procedure Syntax
@subsection Cursors

@cindex Cursors

Simple cursors are supported inside stored procedures and functions.
The syntax is as in embedded SQL.
Cursors are currently asensitive, read-only, and non-scrolling.
Asensitive means that the server may or may not make a copy of its result
table.

For example:

@example
CREATE PROCEDURE curdemo()
BEGIN
  DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '02000' SET done = 1;
  DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT id,data FROM test.t1;

@findex IF

@example
IF search_condition THEN statement(s)
    [ELSEIF search_condition THEN statement(s)]

END IF
@end example

@code{IF} implements a basic conditional construct. If the
@code{search_condition} evaluates to true, the corresponding SQL statement is
executed. If no @code{search_condition} matches, the statement in the
@code{ELSE} clause is executed.

Please note that there is also an @code{IF()} function.

Or:

@example
CASE
    WHEN search_condition THEN statement
    [WHEN search_condition THEN statement ...]
    [ELSE statement]
END CASE
@end example

@code{CASE} implements a complex conditional construct. If a
@code{search_condition} evaluates to true, the corresponding SQL statement is executed. If no search condition matches, the statement in the @code{ELSE} clause is executed.

@strong{Note:} The syntax of a @code{CASE} statement inside a stored
procedure differs slightly from that of the SQL @code{CASE} expression. The
@code{CASE} statement cannot have an @code{ELSE NULL} clause, and the
construct is terminated with @code{END CASE} instead of @code{END}.

@subsubsection @code{LOOP} Statement

@findex LOOP

@example
[begin_label:] LOOP

@code{LOOP} implements a simple loop construct, enabling repeated execution
of a particular statement or group of statements. The statements within the
loop are repeated until the loop is exited; usually this is accomplished
with a @code{LEAVE} statement.

@code{begin_label} and @code{end_label} must be the same, if both are
specified.

@example
ITERATE label
@end example

@code{ITERATE} can only appear within @code{LOOP}, @code{REPEAT}, and
@code{WHILE} statements. @code{ITERATE} means ``do the loop iteration again.''

For example:

@example
CREATE PROCEDURE doiterate(p1 INT)
BEGIN
  label1: LOOP
    SET p1 = p1 + 1;
    IF p1 < 10 THEN ITERATE label1; END IF;

@subsection @code{msql2mysql}, Convert mSQL Programs for Use with MySQL

Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to that for the
mSQL database system. Because of this, mSQL programs often can be converted
relatively easily for use with MySQL by changing the names of the C API
functions.

The @code{msql2mysql} utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API function
calls to their MySQL equivalents.
@code{msql2mysql} converts the input file in place, so make a copy of the
original before converting it.  For example, use @code{msql2mysql} like
this:


@example
shell> cp client-prog.c client-prog.c.orig
shell> msql2mysql client-prog.c
client-prog.c converted
@end example

Then examine @file{client-prog.c} and make any post-conversion revisions
that may be necessary.

@code{msql2mysql} uses the @code{replace} utility to make the function name
substitutions.
@xref{replace utility}.

@node mysql_config,  , msql2mysql, Programming utilities
@subsection @code{mysql_config}, Get compile options for compiling clients

@c TODO: move this to C API section (along with msql2mysql)? They're both
@c of more interest to developers, not to end users.

@code{mysql_config} provides you with useful information for compiling
your MySQL client and connecting it to MySQL.

@code{mysql_config} supports the following options:

@table @code

@item --cflags
Compiler flags to find include files and critical compiler flags and
defines used when compiling the @code{libmysqlclient} library.

@item --include
Compiler options to find MySQL include files. (Note that normally you would use
@code{--cflags} instead of this option.)

@item --libmysqld-libs, --embedded
Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL embedded server.

@item --libs
Libraries and options required to link with the MySQL client library.

@item --libs_r
Libraries and options required to link with the thread-safe MySQL client library.

@item --port
The default TCP/IP port number, defined when configuring MySQL.

@item --socket
The default Unix socket file, defined when configuring MySQL.

@item --version
Version number and version for the MySQL distribution.

@end table

If you invoke @code{mysql_config} with no options, it displays a list of all
options that it supports, and their values:

@example
shell> mysql_config
Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
Options:
  --cflags         [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -mcpu=pentiumpro]
  --include        [-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
  --libs           [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz
                    -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -L/usr/lib -lssl -lcrypto]
  --libs_r         [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient_r
                    -lpthread -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread]
  --socket         [/tmp/mysql.sock]
  --port           [3306]
  --version        [4.0.16]
  --libmysqld-libs [-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql -lmysqld -lpthread -lz
                    -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lpthread -lrt]
@end example

You can use @code{mysql_config} within a command line to include the value
that it displays for a particular option. For example, to compile a MySQL
client program, use @code{mysql_config} as follows:

@example
CFG=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
sh -c "gcc -o progname `$CFG --cflags` progname.c `$CFG --libs`"
@end example

When you use @code{mysql_config} this way, be sure to invoke it within
backtick (@samp{`}) characters.  That tells the shell to execute it and
subsitute its output into the surrounding command.

The C API code is distributed with MySQL. It is included in the
@code{mysqlclient} library and allows C programs to access a database.

Many of the clients in the MySQL source distribution are
written in C.  If you are looking for examples that demonstrate how to
use the C API, take a look at these clients. You can find these in the
@code{clients} directory in the MySQL source distribution.

Most of the other client APIs (all except Connector/J) use the @code{mysqlclient}
library to communicate with the MySQL server. This means that, for
example, you can take advantage of many of the same environment variables
that are used by other client programs, because they are referenced from the
library.  See @ref{Client-Side Scripts}, for a list of these variables.

The client has a maximum communication buffer size. The size of the buffer
that is allocated initially (16KB) is automatically increased up to the
maximum size (the maximum is 16M). Because buffer sizes are increased
only as demand warrants, simply increasing the default maximum limit does not
in itself cause more resources to be used. This size check is mostly a check
for erroneous queries and communication packets.

The communication buffer must be large enough to contain a single SQL
statement (for client-to-server traffic) and one row of returned data (for
server-to-client traffic).  Each thread's communication buffer is dynamically
enlarged to handle any query or row up to the maximum limit.  For example, if
you have @code{BLOB} values that contain up to 16MB of data, you must have a
communication buffer limit of at least 16MB (in both server and client).  The
client's default maximum is 16MB, but the default maximum in the server is
1MB.  You can increase this by changing the value of the
@code{max_allowed_packet} parameter when the server is started.  @xref{Server
parameters}.

The MySQL server shrinks each communication buffer to
@code{net_buffer_length} bytes after each query.  For clients, the size of
the buffer associated with a connection is not decreased until the connection
is closed, at which time client memory is reclaimed.

For programming with threads, see @ref{Threaded clients}.
For creating a stand-alone application which includes the
"server" and "client" in the same program (and does not
communicate with an external MySQL server), see @ref{libmysqld}.

This structure represents a handle to one database connection. It is
used for almost all MySQL functions.

@tindex MYSQL_RES C type
@item MYSQL_RES
This structure represents the result of a query that returns rows
(@code{SELECT}, @code{SHOW}, @code{DESCRIBE}, @code{EXPLAIN}).  The
information returned from a query is called the @emph{result set} in the
remainder of this section.

@tindex MYSQL_ROW C type
@item MYSQL_ROW
This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is currently
implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You cannot treat these as
null-terminated strings if field values may contain binary data, because such
values may contain null bytes internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling
@code{mysql_fetch_row()}.

@tindex MYSQL_FIELD C type
@item MYSQL_FIELD
This structure contains information about a field, such as the field's
name, type, and size. Its members are described in more detail here.
You may obtain the @code{MYSQL_FIELD} structures for each field by
calling @code{mysql_fetch_field()} repeatedly.  Field values are not part of
this structure; they are contained in a @code{MYSQL_ROW} structure.


@tindex MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET C type
@item MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET
This is a type-safe representation of an offset into a MySQL field
list.  (Used by @code{mysql_field_seek()}.)  Offsets are field numbers
within a row, beginning at zero.

@tindex my_ulonglong C type
@tindex my_ulonglong values, printing
@item my_ulonglong
The type used for the number of rows and for @code{mysql_affected_rows()},
@code{mysql_num_rows()}, and @code{mysql_insert_id()}. This type provides a
range of @code{0} to @code{1.84e19}.

On some systems, attempting to print a value of type @code{my_ulonglong}
will not work.  To print such a value, convert it to @code{unsigned long}
and use a @code{%lu} print format.  Example:
@example
printf ("Number of rows: %lu\n", (unsigned long) mysql_num_rows(result));
@end example
@end table

@noindent
The @code{MYSQL_FIELD} structure contains the members listed here:

@table @code
@item char * name
The name of the field, as a null-terminated string.

@item char * table
The name of the table containing this field, if it isn't a calculated field.
For calculated fields, the @code{table} value is an empty string.

@item char * def
The default value of this field, as a null-terminated string.  This is set
only if you use @code{mysql_list_fields()}.

@item enum enum_field_types type
The type of the field.

You can use the @code{IS_NUM()} macro to test whether a field has a
numeric type.  Pass the @code{type} value to @code{IS_NUM()} and it
will evaluate to TRUE if the field is numeric:

@example
if (IS_NUM(field->type))
    printf("Field is numeric\n");
@end example

@item unsigned int length
The width of the field, as specified in the table definition.

@item unsigned int max_length
The maximum width of the field for the result set (the length of the longest
field value for the rows actually in the result set). If you use
@code{mysql_store_result()} or @code{mysql_list_fields()}, this contains the
maximum length for the field.  If you use @code{mysql_use_result()}, the
value of this variable is zero.

@item unsigned int flags
Different bit-flags for the field.  The @code{flags} value may have zero
or more of the following bits set:

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .55
@item @strong{Flag Value}         @tab @strong{Flag Description}
@item @code{NOT_NULL_FLAG}       @tab Field can't be @code{NULL}
@item @code{PRI_KEY_FLAG}        @tab Field is part of a primary key
@item @code{UNIQUE_KEY_FLAG}     @tab Field is part of a unique key
@item @code{MULTIPLE_KEY_FLAG}   @tab Field is part of a non-unique key
@item @code{UNSIGNED_FLAG}       @tab Field has the @code{UNSIGNED} attribute
@item @code{ZEROFILL_FLAG}       @tab Field has the @code{ZEROFILL} attribute
@item @code{BINARY_FLAG}         @tab Field has the @code{BINARY} attribute
@item @code{AUTO_INCREMENT_FLAG} @tab Field has the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
attribute
@item @code{ENUM_FLAG}           @tab Field is an @code{ENUM} (deprecated)
@item @code{SET_FLAG}            @tab Field is a @code{SET} (deprecated)
@item @code{BLOB_FLAG}           @tab Field is a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} (deprecated)
@item @code{TIMESTAMP_FLAG}      @tab Field is a @code{TIMESTAMP} (deprecated)
@end multitable

Use of the @code{BLOB_FLAG}, @code{ENUM_FLAG}, @code{SET_FLAG}, and
@code{TIMESTAMP_FLAG} flags is deprecated because they indicate the type of
a field rather than an attribute of its type.  It is preferable to test
@code{field->type} against @code{FIELD_TYPE_BLOB}, @code{FIELD_TYPE_ENUM},
@code{FIELD_TYPE_SET}, or @code{FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP} instead.

@noindent
The following example illustrates a typical use of the @code{flags} value:

@example
if (field->flags & NOT_NULL_FLAG)
    printf("Field can't be null\n");
@end example

You may use the following convenience macros to determine the boolean
status of the @code{flags} value:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .55
@item @strong{Flag Status} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{IS_NOT_NULL(flags)} @tab True if this field is defined as @code{NOT NULL}
@item @code{IS_PRI_KEY(flags)}  @tab True if this field is a primary key
@item @code{IS_BLOB(flags)}     @tab True if this field is a @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} (deprecated; test @code{field->type} instead)
@end multitable

@item unsigned int decimals
The number of decimals for numeric fields.
@end table

@end multitable

To connect to the server, call @code{mysql_init()} to initialize a
connection handler, then call @code{mysql_real_connect()} with that
handler (along with other information such as the hostname, username,
and password).  Upon connection, @code{mysql_real_connect()} sets the
@code{reconnect} flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of
@code{1}. This flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be
performed because of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the
server before giving up.  When you are done with the connection, call
@code{mysql_close()} to terminate it.

While a connection is active, the client may send SQL queries to the server
using @code{mysql_query()} or @code{mysql_real_query()}.  The difference
between the two is that @code{mysql_query()} expects the query to be
specified as a null-terminated string whereas @code{mysql_real_query()}
expects a counted string.  If the string contains binary data (which may
include null bytes), you must use @code{mysql_real_query()}.

For each non-@code{SELECT} query (for example, @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE},
@code{DELETE}), you can find out how many rows were changed (affected)
by calling @code{mysql_affected_rows()}.

For @code{SELECT} queries, you retrieve the selected rows as a result set.
(Note that some statements are @code{SELECT}-like in that they return rows.
These include @code{SHOW}, @code{DESCRIBE}, and @code{EXPLAIN}.  They should
be treated the same way as @code{SELECT} statements.)

There are two ways for a client to process result sets.  One way is to
retrieve the entire result set all at once by calling
@code{mysql_store_result()}.  This function acquires from the server all the
rows returned by the query and stores them in the client.  The second way is
for the client to initiate a row-by-row result set retrieval by calling
@code{mysql_use_result()}.  This function initializes the retrieval, but does
not actually get any rows from the server.

In both cases, you access rows by calling @code{mysql_fetch_row()}.  With
@code{mysql_store_result()}, @code{mysql_fetch_row()} accesses rows that have
already been fetched from the server.  With @code{mysql_use_result()},
@code{mysql_fetch_row()} actually retrieves the row from the server.
Information about the size of the data in each row is available by
calling @code{mysql_fetch_lengths()}.

After you are done with a result set, call @code{mysql_free_result()}
to free the memory used for it.

The two retrieval mechanisms are complementary.  Client programs should
choose the approach that is most appropriate for their requirements.
In practice, clients tend to use @code{mysql_store_result()} more
commonly.

An advantage of @code{mysql_store_result()} is that because the rows have all
been fetched to the client, you not only can access rows sequentially, you
can move back and forth in the result set using @code{mysql_data_seek()} or
@code{mysql_row_seek()} to change the current row position within the result
set.  You can also find out how many rows there are by calling
@code{mysql_num_rows()}.  On the other hand, the memory requirements for
@code{mysql_store_result()} may be very high for large result sets and you
are more likely to encounter out-of-memory conditions.

An advantage of @code{mysql_use_result()} is that the client requires less
memory for the result set because it maintains only one row at a time (and
because there is less allocation overhead, @code{mysql_use_result()} can be
faster).  Disadvantages are that you must process each row quickly to avoid
tying up the server, you don't have random access to rows within the result
set (you can only access rows sequentially), and you don't know how many rows
are in the result set until you have retrieved them all.  Furthermore, you
@strong{must} retrieve all the rows even if you determine in mid-retrieval that
you've found the information you were looking for.

The API makes it possible for clients to respond appropriately to
queries (retrieving rows only as necessary) without knowing whether or
not the query is a @code{SELECT}.  You can do this by calling
@code{mysql_store_result()} after each @code{mysql_query()} (or
@code{mysql_real_query()}).  If the result set call succeeds, the query
was a @code{SELECT} and you can read the rows.  If the result set call
fails, call @code{mysql_field_count()} to determine whether a
result was actually to be expected.  If @code{mysql_field_count()}
returns zero, the query returned no data (indicating that it was an
@code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}, etc.), and was not
expected to return rows.  If @code{mysql_field_count()} is non-zero, the
query should have returned rows, but didn't.  This indicates that the
query was a @code{SELECT} that failed.  See the description for
@code{mysql_field_count()} for an example of how this can be done.

Both @code{mysql_store_result()} and @code{mysql_use_result()} allow you to
obtain information about the fields that make up the result set (the number
of fields, their names and types, etc.).  You can access field information
sequentially within the row by calling @code{mysql_fetch_field()} repeatedly,
or by field number within the row by calling
@code{mysql_fetch_field_direct()}.  The current field cursor position may be
changed by calling @code{mysql_field_seek()}.  Setting the field cursor
affects subsequent calls to @code{mysql_fetch_field()}.  You can also get
information for fields all at once by calling @code{mysql_fetch_fields()}.

For detecting and reporting errors, MySQL provides access to error
information by means of the @code{mysql_errno()} and @code{mysql_error()}
functions.  These return the error code or error message for the most
recently invoked function that can succeed or fail, allowing you to determine
when an error occurred and what it was.

In the descriptions here, a parameter or return value of @code{NULL} means
@code{NULL} in the sense of the C programming language, not a
MySQL @code{NULL} value.

Functions that return a value generally return a pointer or an integer.
Unless specified otherwise, functions returning a pointer return a
non-@code{NULL} value to indicate success or a @code{NULL} value to indicate
an error, and functions returning an integer return zero to indicate success
or non-zero to indicate an error.  Note that ``non-zero'' means just that.
Unless the function description says otherwise, do not test against a value
other than zero:

@example
if (result)                   /* correct */
    ... error ...

if (result < 0)               /* incorrect */
    ... error ...

if (result == -1)             /* incorrect */
    ... error ...
@end example

When a function returns an error, the @strong{Errors} subsection of the
function description lists the possible types of errors.  You can
find out which of these occurred by calling @code{mysql_errno()}.
A string representation of the error may be obtained by calling
@code{mysql_error()}.


@node mysql_affected_rows, mysql_change_user, C API functions, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_affected_rows()}

@findex @code{mysql_affected_rows()}

@code{my_ulonglong mysql_affected_rows(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

Returns the number of rows changed by the last @code{UPDATE}, deleted by
the last @code{DELETE} or inserted by the last @code{INSERT}
statement. May be called immediately after @code{mysql_query()} for
@code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}, or @code{INSERT} statements.  For
@code{SELECT} statements, @code{mysql_affected_rows()} works like
@code{mysql_num_rows()}.

@subsubheading Return Values

An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected or
retrieved.  Zero indicates that no records were updated for an
@code{UPDATE} statement, no rows matched the @code{WHERE} clause in the
query or that no query has yet been executed.  @minus{}1 indicates that the
query returned an error or that, for a @code{SELECT} query,
@code{mysql_affected_rows()} was called prior to calling
@code{mysql_store_result()}. Because @code{mysql_affected_rows()}
returns an unsigned value, you can check for @minus{}1 by comparing the
return value to @code{(my_ulonglong)-1} (or to @code{(my_ulonglong)~0},
which is equivalent).

@subsubheading Errors

None.

@subsubheading Example

@example
mysql_query(&mysql,"UPDATE products SET cost=cost*1.25 WHERE group=10");
printf("%ld products updated",(long) mysql_affected_rows(&mysql));
@end example

If one specifies the flag @code{CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS} when connecting to
@code{mysqld}, @code{mysql_affected_rows()} will return the number of
rows matched by the @code{WHERE} statement for @code{UPDATE} statements.

Note that when one uses a @code{REPLACE} command,
@code{mysql_affected_rows()} will return 2 if the new row replaced and
old row.  This is because in this case one row was inserted after the
duplicate was deleted.


@node mysql_change_user, mysql_character_set_name, mysql_affected_rows, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_change_user()}

@findex @code{mysql_change_user()}

@code{my_bool mysql_change_user(MYSQL *mysql, const char *user, const
char *password, const char *db)}

@subsubheading Description

Changes the user and causes the database specified by @code{db} to
become the default (current) database on the connection specified by
@code{mysql}.  In subsequent queries, this database is the default for
table references that do not include an explicit database specifier.

This function was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.3.

@code{mysql_change_user()} fails if the connected user cannot be
authenticated or doesn't have permission to use the database.  In
this case the user and database are not changed

The @code{db} parameter may be set to @code{NULL} if you don't want to have a
default database.

Starting from MySQL 4.0.6 this command will always @code{ROLLBACK} any

@subsubheading Description

This function is deprecated.  It is preferable to use
@code{mysql_real_connect()} instead.

@code{mysql_connect()} attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL
database engine running on @code{host}.  @code{mysql_connect()} must complete
successfully before you can execute any of the other API functions, with the
exception of @code{mysql_get_client_info()}.

The meanings of the parameters are the same as for the corresponding
parameters for @code{mysql_real_connect()} with the difference that the
connection parameter may be @code{NULL}. In this case the C API
allocates memory for the connection structure automatically and frees it
when you call @code{mysql_close()}. The disadvantage of this approach is
that you can't retrieve an error message if the connection fails.  (To
get error information from @code{mysql_errno()} or @code{mysql_error()},
you must provide a valid @code{MYSQL} pointer.)

@subsubsection @code{mysql_eof()}

@findex @code{mysql_eof()}

@code{my_bool mysql_eof(MYSQL_RES *result)}

@subsubheading Description

This function is deprecated.  @code{mysql_errno()} or @code{mysql_error()}
may be used instead.

@code{mysql_eof()} determines whether the last row of a result
set has been read.

If you acquire a result set from a successful call to
@code{mysql_store_result()}, the client receives the entire set in one
operation.  In this case, a @code{NULL} return from
@code{mysql_fetch_row()} always means the end of the result set has been
reached and it is unnecessary to call @code{mysql_eof()}.  When used
with @code{mysql_store_result()}, @code{mysql_eof()} will always return
true.

On the other hand, if you use @code{mysql_use_result()} to initiate a result
set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by one as
you call @code{mysql_fetch_row()} repeatedly.  Because an error may occur on
the connection during this process, a @code{NULL} return value from
@code{mysql_fetch_row()} does not necessarily mean the end of the result set
was reached normally.  In this case, you can use @code{mysql_eof()} to
determine what happened.  @code{mysql_eof()} returns a non-zero value if the
end of the result set was reached and zero if an error occurred.

Historically, @code{mysql_eof()} predates the standard MySQL error
functions @code{mysql_errno()} and @code{mysql_error()}.  Because those error
functions provide the same information, their use is preferred over
@code{mysql_eof()}, which is now deprecated.  (In fact, they provide more
information, because @code{mysql_eof()} returns only a boolean value whereas
the error functions indicate a reason for the error when one occurs.)

@subsubheading Return Values

Zero if no error occurred. Non-zero if the end of the result set has been
reached.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

@subsubheading Example

The following example shows how you might use @code{mysql_eof()}:

@example
mysql_query(&mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
@{
    // do something with data
@}
if(!mysql_eof(result))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
@{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
@}
@end example

However, you can achieve the same effect with the standard MySQL
error functions:

@example
mysql_query(&mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))
@{
    // do something with data
@}
if(mysql_errno(&mysql))  // mysql_fetch_row() failed due to an error
@{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
@}
@end example


@node mysql_errno, mysql_error, mysql_eof, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_errno()}

@findex @code{mysql_errno()}

@code{unsigned int mysql_errno(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

For the connection specified by @code{mysql}, @code{mysql_errno()} returns
the error code for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  A return value of zero means that no error occurred. Client error
message numbers are listed in the MySQL @file{errmsg.h} header file.
Server error message numbers are listed in @file{mysqld_error.h}. In the
MySQL source distribution you can find a complete list of
error messages and error numbers in the file @file{Docs/mysqld_error.txt}.
The server error codes also are listed at @ref{Error-returns}.

Note that some functions like @code{mysql_fetch_row()} don't set
@code{mysql_errno()} if they succeed.

A rule of thumb is that all functions that have to ask the server for
information will reset @code{mysql_errno()} if they succeed.

@subsubheading Return Values

An error code value for the last mysql_xxx call, if it failed.
zero means no error occurred.

@subsubheading Errors
None.


@node mysql_error, mysql_escape_string, mysql_errno, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_error()}

@findex @code{mysql_error()}

@code{const char *mysql_error(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

For the connection specified by @code{mysql}, @code{mysql_error()}
returns a null-terminated string containing the error message for the
most recently invoked API function that failed. If a function didn't
fail, the return value of @code{mysql_error()} may be the previous error
or an empty string to indicate no error.

A rule of thumb is that all functions that have to ask the server for
information will reset @code{mysql_error()} if they succeed.

For functions that resets @code{mysql_errno}, the following two tests
are equivalent:

@example
if(mysql_errno(&mysql))
@{
    // an error occurred
@}

if(mysql_error(&mysql)[0] != '\0')
@{
    // an error occurred
@}
@end example

The language of the client error messages may be changed by
recompiling the MySQL client library. Currently you can choose
error messages in several different languages.
@xref{Languages}.

@subsubheading Return Values

A null-terminated character string that describes the error.  An empty string
if no error occurred.

@subsubheading Errors
None.


@node mysql_escape_string, mysql_fetch_field, mysql_error, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_escape_string()}

@findex @code{mysql_escape_string()}

You should use @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} instead!

This function is identical to @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} except
that @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} takes a connection handler as
its first argument and escapes the string according to the current
character set.  @code{mysql_escape_string()} does not take a connection
argument and does not respect the current charset setting.


@node mysql_fetch_field, mysql_fetch_fields, mysql_escape_string, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_fetch_field()}

@findex @code{mysql_fetch_field()}

@code{MYSQL_FIELD *mysql_fetch_field(MYSQL_RES *result)}

@subsubheading Description

Returns the definition of one column of a result set as a @code{MYSQL_FIELD}
structure. Call this function repeatedly to retrieve information about all
columns in the result set.  @code{mysql_fetch_field()} returns @code{NULL}
when no more fields are left.

@code{mysql_fetch_field()} is reset to return information about the first
field each time you execute a new @code{SELECT} query.  The field returned by
@code{mysql_fetch_field()} is also affected by calls to
@code{mysql_field_seek()}.

If you've called @code{mysql_query()} to perform a @code{SELECT} on a table
but have not called @code{mysql_store_result()}, MySQL returns the
default blob length (8KB) if you call @code{mysql_fetch_field()} to ask
for the length of a @code{BLOB} field.  (The 8KB size is chosen because
MySQL doesn't know the maximum length for the @code{BLOB}. This
should be made configurable sometime.) Once you've retrieved the result set,
@code{field->max_length} contains the length of the largest value for this
column in the specific query.

@subsubheading Return Values

The @code{MYSQL_FIELD} structure for the current column. @code{NULL}
if no columns are left.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

MYSQL_FIELD *field;

while((field = mysql_fetch_field(result)))

@subsubheading Description

Given a field number @code{fieldnr} for a column within a result set, returns
that column's field definition as a @code{MYSQL_FIELD} structure. You may use
this function to retrieve the definition for an arbitrary column.  The value
of @code{fieldnr} should be in the range from 0 to
@code{mysql_num_fields(result)-1}.

@subsubheading Return Values

The @code{MYSQL_FIELD} structure for the specified column.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

@subsubheading Example

@example

@code{unsigned long *mysql_fetch_lengths(MYSQL_RES *result)}

@subsubheading Description

Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row within a result set.
If you plan to copy field values, this length information is also useful for
optimization, because you can avoid calling @code{strlen()}.  In addition, if
the result set contains binary data, you @strong{must} use this function to
determine the size of the data, because @code{strlen()} returns incorrect
results for any field containing null characters.

The length for empty columns and for columns containing @code{NULL} values is
zero.  To see how to distinguish these two cases, see the description for
@code{mysql_fetch_row()}.

@subsubheading Return Values

An array of unsigned long integers representing the size of each column (not
including any terminating null characters).
@code{NULL} if an error occurred.

@subsubheading Errors
@code{mysql_fetch_lengths()} is valid only for the current row of the result
set.  It returns @code{NULL} if you call it before calling
@code{mysql_fetch_row()} or after retrieving all rows in the result.

@code{MYSQL_ROW mysql_fetch_row(MYSQL_RES *result)}

@subsubheading Description

Retrieves the next row of a result set. When used after
@code{mysql_store_result()}, @code{mysql_fetch_row()} returns @code{NULL}
when there are no more rows to retrieve.  When used after
@code{mysql_use_result()}, @code{mysql_fetch_row()} returns @code{NULL} when
there are no more rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

The number of values in the row is given by @code{mysql_num_fields(result)}.
If @code{row} holds the return value from a call to @code{mysql_fetch_row()},
pointers to the values are accessed as @code{row[0]} to
@code{row[mysql_num_fields(result)-1]}.  @code{NULL} values in the row are
indicated by @code{NULL} pointers.

The lengths of the field values in the row may be obtained by calling
@code{mysql_fetch_lengths()}.  Empty fields and fields containing
@code{NULL} both have length 0; you can distinguish these by checking
the pointer for the field value.  If the pointer is @code{NULL}, the field
is @code{NULL}; otherwise, the field is empty.

@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL_ROW} structure for the next row.  @code{NULL} if
there are no more rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

@subsubheading Errors

Note that error is not reset between calls to @code{mysql_fetch_row()}

@code{unsigned int mysql_field_count(MYSQL *mysql)}

If you are using a version of MySQL earlier than Version 3.22.24, you
should use @code{unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL *mysql)} instead.

@subsubheading Description

Returns the number of columns for the most recent query on the connection.

The normal use of this function is when @code{mysql_store_result()}
returned @code{NULL} (and thus you have no result set pointer).
In this case, you can call @code{mysql_field_count()} to
determine whether @code{mysql_store_result()} should have produced a
non-empty result.  This allows the client program to take proper action
without knowing whether the query was a @code{SELECT} (or
@code{SELECT}-like) statement.  The example shown here illustrates how this
may be done.

@xref{NULL mysql_store_result, , @code{NULL mysql_store_result()}}.

@subsubheading Return Values

An unsigned integer representing the number of fields in a result set.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

unsigned int num_fields;
unsigned int num_rows;

if (mysql_query(&mysql,query_string))

    @{
        num_fields = mysql_num_fields(result);
        // retrieve rows, then call mysql_free_result(result)
    @}
    else  // mysql_store_result() returned nothing; should it have?
    @{
        if(mysql_field_count(&mysql) == 0)
        @{
            // query does not return data
            // (it was not a SELECT)
            num_rows = mysql_affected_rows(&mysql);

@end example

An alternative is to replace the @code{mysql_field_count(&mysql)} call with
@code{mysql_errno(&mysql)}.  In this case, you are checking directly for an
error from @code{mysql_store_result()} rather than inferring from the value
of @code{mysql_field_count()} whether the statement was a

@subsubheading Description

Returns the version number of the server as an integer (new in 4.1).

@subsubheading Return Values

A number that represents the MySQL server version in this format:

@example
major_version*10000 + minor_version *100 + sub_version
@end example

For example, 4.1.2 is returned as 40102.

This function is useful in client programs for quickly determining
whether some version-specific server capability exists.

@subsubheading Errors
None.


@node mysql_info, mysql_init, mysql_get_server_version, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_info()}

@findex @code{mysql_info()}

@code{char *mysql_info(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

Retrieves a string providing information about the most recently executed
query, but only for the statements listed here.  For other statements,
@code{mysql_info()} returns @code{NULL}.  The format of the string varies
depending on the type of query, as described here.  The numbers are
illustrative only; the string will contain values appropriate for the query.

@table @code
@item INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...
String format: @code{Records: 100 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0}
@item INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...),(...),(...)...
String format: @code{Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0}
@item LOAD DATA INFILE ...
String format: @code{Records: 1 Deleted: 0 Skipped: 0 Warnings: 0}
@item ALTER TABLE
String format: @code{Records: 3 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0}
@item UPDATE
String format: @code{Rows matched: 40 Changed: 40 Warnings: 0}
@end table

Note that @code{mysql_info()} returns a non-@code{NULL} value for
@code{INSERT ... VALUES} only for the multiple-row form
of the statement (that is, only if multiple value lists are
specified).

@subsubheading Return Values

A character string representing additional information about the most
recently executed query.  @code{NULL} if no information is available for the
query.

@subsubheading Errors
None.


@node mysql_init, mysql_insert_id, mysql_info, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_init()}

@findex @code{mysql_init()}

@code{MYSQL *mysql_init(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

Allocates or initializes a @code{MYSQL} object suitable for
@code{mysql_real_connect()}.  If @code{mysql} is a @code{NULL} pointer, the
function allocates, initializes, and returns a new object.  Otherwise, the
object is initialized and the address of the object is returned.  If
@code{mysql_init()} allocates a new object, it will be freed when
@code{mysql_close()} is called to close the connection.

@subsubheading Return Values

An initialized @code{MYSQL*} handle.  @code{NULL} if there was
insufficient memory to allocate a new object.

@subsubheading Errors
In case of insufficient memory, @code{NULL} is returned.


@node mysql_insert_id, mysql_kill, mysql_init, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_insert_id()}

@findex @code{mysql_insert_id()}

@code{my_ulonglong mysql_insert_id(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

Returns the value generated for an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column by the
previous @code{INSERT} or @code{UPDATE} statement.  Use this function after
you have performed an @code{INSERT} statement into a table that contains an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} field.

More precisely, @code{mysql_insert_id()} is updated under these conditions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{INSERT} statements that store a value into an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
column. This is true whether the value is automatically generated by
storing the special values @code{NULL} or @code{0} into the column, or is
an explicit non-special value.

@item
In the case of a multiple-row @code{INSERT} statement, @code{mysql_insert_id()}
returns the @strong{first} automatically generated @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
value; if no such value is generated, it returns the last @strong{last}
explicit value inserted into the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.

@item
@code{INSERT} statements that generate an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value by
inserting @code{LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)} into any column.

@item
@code{INSERT} statements that generate an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value by
updating any column to @code{LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)}.

@item
The value of @code{mysql_insert_id()} is not affected by statements such as
@code{SELECT} that return a result set.

@item
If the previous statement returned an error,
the value of @code{mysql_insert_id()} is undefined.
@end itemize

Note that @code{mysql_insert_id()} returns @code{0} if the previous statement
does not use an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value.  If you need to save
the value for later, be sure to call @code{mysql_insert_id()} immediately
after the statement that generates the value.

The value of @code{mysql_insert_id()} is affected only by statements issued
within the current client connection. It is not affected by statements issued
by other clients.

@xref{Information functions}.

Also note that the value of the SQL @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} function always
contains the most recently generated @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value, and is
not reset between statements because the value of that function is maintained
in the server.  Another difference is that @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} is not
updated if you set an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column to a specific non-special
value.

The reason for the difference between @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} and
@code{mysql_insert_id()} is that @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} is made easy to
use in scripts while @code{mysql_insert_id()} tries to provide a little
more exact information of what happens to the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.

@subsubheading Return Values

Described in the preceding discussion.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

the simple regular expression specified by the @code{wild} parameter.
@code{wild} may contain the wildcard characters @samp{%} or @samp{_}, or may
be a @code{NULL} pointer to match all fields.  Calling
@code{mysql_list_fields()} is similar to executing the query @code{SHOW

Note that it's recommended that you use @code{SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name}
instead of @code{mysql_list_fields()}.

You must free the result set with @code{mysql_free_result()}.

@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL_RES} result set for success.  @code{NULL} if an error occurred.

@code{wild} may contain the wildcard characters @samp{%} or @samp{_}, or may
be a @code{NULL} pointer to match all tables.  Calling

@code{unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL_RES *result)}

Or:

@code{unsigned int mysql_num_fields(MYSQL *mysql)}

The second form doesn't work on MySQL Version 3.22.24 or newer.  To pass a
@code{MYSQL*} argument, you must use
@code{unsigned int mysql_field_count(MYSQL *mysql)} instead.

@subsubheading Description

Returns the number of columns in a result set.

Note that you can get the number of columns either from a pointer to a result
set or to a connection handle.  You would use the connection handle if
@code{mysql_store_result()} or @code{mysql_use_result()} returned
@code{NULL} (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you can
call @code{mysql_field_count()} to determine whether
@code{mysql_store_result()} should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether or
not the query was a @code{SELECT} (or @code{SELECT}-like) statement.  The
example shown here illustrates how this may be done.

@xref{NULL mysql_store_result, , @code{NULL mysql_store_result()}}.

@subsubheading Return Values

An unsigned integer representing the number of fields in a result set.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

@subsubheading Example

@example
MYSQL_RES *result;
unsigned int num_fields;
unsigned int num_rows;

if (mysql_query(&mysql,query_string))
@{
    // error
@}
else // query succeeded, process any data returned by it
@{
    result = mysql_store_result(&mysql);
    if (result)  // there are rows
    @{
        num_fields = mysql_num_fields(result);
        // retrieve rows, then call mysql_free_result(result)
    @}
    else  // mysql_store_result() returned nothing; should it have?
    @{
        if (mysql_errno(&mysql))
        @{
           fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&mysql));
        @}
        else if (mysql_field_count(&mysql) == 0)
        @{
            // query does not return data
            // (it was not a SELECT)
            num_rows = mysql_affected_rows(&mysql);
        @}
    @}
@}
@end example

An alternative (if you know that your query should have returned a result set)
is to replace the @code{mysql_errno(&mysql)} call with a check whether
@code{mysql_field_count(&mysql)} is = 0.  This will happen only if something
went wrong.


@node mysql_num_rows, mysql_options, mysql_num_fields, C API functions
@subsubsection @code{mysql_num_rows()}

@findex @code{mysql_num_rows()}

@code{my_ulonglong mysql_num_rows(MYSQL_RES *result)}

@subsubheading Description

Returns the number of rows in the result set.

The use of @code{mysql_num_rows()} depends on whether you use
@code{mysql_store_result()} or @code{mysql_use_result()} to return the result
set.  If you use @code{mysql_store_result()}, @code{mysql_num_rows()} may be
called immediately.  If you use @code{mysql_use_result()},
@code{mysql_num_rows()} will not return the correct value until all the rows
in the result set have been retrieved.

@subsubheading Return Values

The number of rows in the result set.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

The query must consist of a single SQL statement.  You should not add
a terminating semicolon (@samp{;}) or @code{\g} to the statement.

@code{mysql_query()} cannot be used for queries that contain binary data; you

                 unsigned int port, const char *unix_socket,
                 unsigned long client_flag)}

@subsubheading Description

@code{mysql_real_connect()} attempts to establish a connection to a
MySQL database engine running on @code{host}.
@code{mysql_real_connect()} must complete successfully before you can execute
any of the other API functions, with the exception of
@code{mysql_get_client_info()}.

The parameters are specified as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The first parameter should be the address of an existing @code{MYSQL}
structure.  Before calling @code{mysql_real_connect()} you must call
@code{mysql_init()} to initialize the @code{MYSQL} structure. You can
change a lot of connect options with the @code{mysql_options()}
call.  @xref{mysql_options, @code{mysql_options()}}.

@item
The value of @code{host} may be either a hostname or an IP address.  If
@code{host} is @code{NULL} or the string @code{"localhost"}, a connection to
the local host is assumed. If the OS supports sockets (Unix) or named pipes
(Windows), they are used instead of TCP/IP to connect to the server.

@item
The @code{user} parameter contains the user's MySQL login ID.  If
@code{user} is @code{NULL} or the empty string @code{""}, the current
user is assumed.  Under Unix, this is the current login name.  Under
Windows ODBC, the current username must be specified explicitly.
@xref{ODBC administrator}.

@item
The @code{passwd} parameter contains the password for @code{user}.  If
@code{passwd} is @code{NULL}, only entries in the @code{user} table for the
user that have a blank (empty) password field will be checked for a match. This
allows the database administrator to set up the MySQL privilege
system in such a way that users get different privileges depending on whether
or not they have specified a password.

Note: Do not attempt to encrypt the password before calling
@code{mysql_real_connect()}; password encryption is handled automatically by
the client API.

@item
@code{db} is the database name.
If @code{db} is not @code{NULL}, the connection will set the default
database to this value.

@item
If @code{port} is not 0, the value will be used as the port number
for the TCP/IP connection.  Note that the @code{host} parameter
determines the type of the connection.

@item
If @code{unix_socket} is not @code{NULL}, the string specifies the
socket or named pipe that should be used.  Note that the @code{host}
parameter determines the type of the connection.

@item
The value of @code{client_flag} is usually 0, but can be set to a combination
of the following flags in very special circumstances:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .65
@item @strong{Flag Name}       @tab @strong{Flag Nescription}
@item @code{CLIENT_COMPRESS}   @tab Use compression protocol.
@item @code{CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS} @tab Return the number of found (matched) rows, not the number of affected rows.
@item @code{CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE} @tab Allow spaces after function names. Makes all functions names reserved words.
@item @code{CLIENT_INTERACTIVE} @tab Allow @code{interactive_timeout} seconds (instead of @code{wait_timeout} seconds) of inactivity before closing the connection. The client's session @code{wait_timeout} variable will be set to the value of the session @code{interactive_timeout} variable.
@item @code{CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES} @tab Enable @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} handling.
@item @code{CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS} @tab Tell the server that the client may send multiple-row-queries (separated by @samp{;}). If this flag is not set, multiple-row-queries are disabled. New in 4.1.
@item @code{CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS} @tab Tell the server that the client can handle multiple-result sets from multi-queries or stored procedures.  This is automatically set if @code{CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS} is set. New in 4.1.
@item @code{CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA}  @tab Don't allow the @code{db_name.tbl_name.col_name} syntax.  This is for ODBC. It causes the parser to generate an error if you use that syntax, which is useful for trapping bugs in some ODBC programs.
@item @code{CLIENT_ODBC}       @tab The client is an ODBC client. This changes @code{mysqld} to be more ODBC-friendly.
@item @code{CLIENT_SSL}         @tab Use SSL (encrypted protocol). This option should not be set by application programs; it is set internally in the client library.
@end multitable
@end itemize

@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL*} connection handle if the connection was successful,
@code{NULL} if the connection was unsuccessful.  For a successful connection,

@subsubheading Example

@example
MYSQL mysql;

mysql_init(&mysql);
mysql_options(&mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"your_prog_name");
if (!mysql_real_connect(&mysql,"host","user","passwd","database",0,NULL,0))
@{
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect to database: Error: %s\n",
          mysql_error(&mysql));
@}
@end example

By using @code{mysql_options()} the MySQL library will read the
@code{[client]} and @code{[your_prog_name]} sections in the @file{my.cnf}
file which will ensure that your program will work, even if someone has
set up MySQL in some non-standard way.

Note that upon connection, @code{mysql_real_connect()} sets the @code{reconnect}
flag (part of the @code{MYSQL} structure) to a value of @code{1}. This
flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be performed because
of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the server before giving up.

@subsubsection @code{mysql_real_escape_string()}

@findex @code{mysql_real_escape_string()}

@code{unsigned long mysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to, const char *from, unsigned long length)}

@subsubheading Description

This function is used to create a legal SQL string that you can use in a
SQL statement. @xref{String syntax}.

The string in @code{from} is encoded to an escaped SQL string, taking
into account the current character set of the connection. The result is placed
in @code{to} and a terminating null byte is appended.  Characters
encoded are @code{NUL} (ASCII 0), @samp{\n}, @samp{\r}, @samp{\},
@samp{'}, @samp{"}, and Control-Z (@pxref{Literals}).
(Strictly speaking, MySQL requires only that backslash and the quote
character used to quote the string in the query be escaped.  This function
quotes the other characters to make them easier to read in log files.)

The string pointed to by @code{from} must be @code{length} bytes long.  You
must allocate the @code{to} buffer to be at least @code{length*2+1} bytes
long.  (In the worst case, each character may need to be encoded as using two
bytes, and you need room for the terminating null byte.)  When
@code{mysql_real_escape_string()} returns, the contents of @code{to} will be a
null-terminated string.  The return value is the length of the encoded
string, not including the terminating null character.

@subsubheading Example

@example
char query[1000],*end;

end = strmov(query,"INSERT INTO test_table values(");
*end++ = '\'';
end += mysql_real_escape_string(&mysql, end,"What's this",11);
*end++ = '\'';
*end++ = ',';
*end++ = '\'';
end += mysql_real_escape_string(&mysql, end,"binary data: \0\r\n",16);
*end++ = '\'';
*end++ = ')';

if (mysql_real_query(&mysql,query,(unsigned int) (end - query)))
@{
   fprintf(stderr, "Failed to insert row, Error: %s\n",
           mysql_error(&mysql));
@}
@end example

The @code{strmov()} function used in the example is included in the
@code{mysqlclient} library and works like @code{strcpy()} but returns a
pointer to the terminating null of the first parameter.

@subsubheading Return Values

The length of the value placed into @code{to}, not including the
terminating null character.

@subsubheading Errors
None.

@code{int mysql_real_query(MYSQL *mysql, const char *query, unsigned long length)}

@subsubheading Description

Executes the SQL query pointed to by @code{query}, which should be a string
@code{length} bytes long.  The query must consist of a single SQL statement.
You should not add a terminating semicolon (@samp{;}) or @code{\g} to the
statement.

You @strong{must} use @code{mysql_real_query()} rather than
@code{mysql_query()} for queries that contain binary data, because binary data
may contain the @samp{\0} character.  In addition, @code{mysql_real_query()}
is faster than @code{mysql_query()} because it does not call @code{strlen()} on
the query string.

If you want to know whether the query should return a result set, you can
use @code{mysql_field_count()} to check for this.

@subsubheading Description
Sets the row cursor to an arbitrary row in a query result set.
The @code{offset} value is a row offset that should be a value returned
from @code{mysql_row_tell()} or from @code{mysql_row_seek()}.
This value is not a row number; if you want to seek to a row within a

This function requires that the result set structure contains the
entire result of the query, so @code{mysql_row_seek()} may be used
only in conjunction with @code{mysql_store_result()}, not with
@code{mysql_use_result()}.

@subsubheading Return Values

The previous value of the row cursor.  This value may be passed to a

@code{mysql_ssl_set()} does nothing unless OpenSSL support is enabled in
the client library.

@code{mysql} is the connection handler returned from @code{mysql_init()}.
The other parameters are specified as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{key} is the pathname to the key file.

@item
@code{cert} is the pathname to the certificate file.

@item
@code{ca} is the pathname to the certificate authority file.

@subsubsection @code{mysql_store_result()}

@code{MYSQL_RES *mysql_store_result(MYSQL *mysql)}

@subsubheading Description

You must call @code{mysql_store_result()} or @code{mysql_use_result()}
for every query that successfully retrieves data (@code{SELECT},
@code{SHOW}, @code{DESCRIBE}, @code{EXPLAIN}).

You don't have to call @code{mysql_store_result()} or
@code{mysql_use_result()} for other queries, but it will not do any
harm or cause any notable performance if you call @code{mysql_store_result()}
in all cases.  You can detect if the query didn't have a result set by
checking if @code{mysql_store_result()} returns 0 (more about this later on).

If you want to know whether the query should return a result set, you can
use @code{mysql_field_count()} to check for this.
@xref{mysql_field_count, @code{mysql_field_count()}}.

@code{mysql_store_result()} reads the entire result of a query to the client,
allocates a @code{MYSQL_RES} structure, and places the result into this
structure.

@code{mysql_store_result()} returns a null pointer if the query didn't return
a result set (if the query was, for example, an @code{INSERT} statement).

@code{mysql_store_result()} also returns a null pointer if reading of the
result set failed. You can check whether an error occurred by checking if
@code{mysql_error()} returns a non-empty string, if
@code{mysql_errno()} returns non-zero, or if @code{mysql_field_count()}
returns zero.

An empty result set is returned if there are no rows returned.  (An empty
result set differs from a null pointer as a return value.)

Once you have called @code{mysql_store_result()} and got a result back
that isn't a null pointer, you may call @code{mysql_num_rows()} to find
out how many rows are in the result set.

You can call @code{mysql_fetch_row()} to fetch rows from the result set,
or @code{mysql_row_seek()} and @code{mysql_row_tell()} to obtain or
set the current row position within the result set.

You must call @code{mysql_free_result()} once you are done with the result
set.

@xref{NULL mysql_store_result, , @code{NULL mysql_store_result()}}.

@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL_RES} result structure with the results. @code{NULL} if
an error occurred.

@subsubheading Description

Returns the thread ID of the current connection.  This value can be used as
an argument to @code{mysql_kill()} to kill the thread.

If the connection is lost and you reconnect with @code{mysql_ping()}, the
thread ID will change.  This means you should not get the thread ID and store
it for later. You should get it when you need it.

@subsubheading Description

You must call @code{mysql_store_result()} or @code{mysql_use_result()} for
every query that successfully retrieves data (@code{SELECT}, @code{SHOW},
@code{DESCRIBE}, @code{EXPLAIN}).

@code{mysql_use_result()} initiates a result set retrieval but does not
actually read the result set into the client like @code{mysql_store_result()}
does.  Instead, each row must be retrieved individually by making calls to
@code{mysql_fetch_row()}.  This reads the result of a query directly from the
server without storing it in a temporary table or local buffer, which is
somewhat faster and uses much less memory than @code{mysql_store_result()}.
The client will allocate memory only for the current row and a communication
buffer that may grow up to @code{max_allowed_packet} bytes.

On the other hand, you shouldn't use @code{mysql_use_result()} if you are
doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side, or if the output
is sent to a screen on which the user may type a @code{^S} (stop scroll).
This will tie up the server and prevent other threads from updating any
tables from which the data is being fetched.

When using @code{mysql_use_result()}, you must execute
@code{mysql_fetch_row()} until a @code{NULL} value is returned, otherwise, the
unfetched rows will be returned as part of the result set for your next
query. The C API will give the error @code{Commands out of sync; you can't
run this command now} if you forget to do this!

You may not use @code{mysql_data_seek()}, @code{mysql_row_seek()},
@code{mysql_row_tell()}, @code{mysql_num_rows()}, or
@code{mysql_affected_rows()} with a result returned from
@code{mysql_use_result()}, nor may you issue other queries until the
@code{mysql_use_result()} has finished.  (However, after you have fetched all
the rows, @code{mysql_num_rows()} will accurately return the number of rows
fetched.)

You must call @code{mysql_free_result()} once you are done with the result
set.

@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL_RES} result structure. @code{NULL} if an error occurred.

@node C API Prepared statements, C API Prepared statement datatypes, C API functions, C
@subsection C API Prepared Statements

As of MySQL 4.1, the client/server protocol provides for the use of
prepared statements. This capability uses the
@code{MYSQL_STMT} statement handler data structure.
Prepared execution is an efficient way to execute a statement more than
once. The statement is first parsed to prepare it for execution. Then
it is executed one or more times at a later time, using the statement
handle returned by the prepare function.

Prepared execution is faster than direct execution for statements
executed more than once, primarly because the query is parsed only
once. In the case of direct execution, the query is parsed every
time it is executed. Prepared execution also can provide a reduction of network
traffic because for each execution of the prepared statement,
it is necessary only to send the data for the parameters.

Another advantage of prepared statements is that it uses a binary protocol
that makes data transfer between client and server more efficient.
Prepared statements also can support input and output binding for
multiple query execution.


@node C API Prepared statement datatypes, C API Prepared statement function overview, C API Prepared statements, C
@subsection C API Prepared Statement Data types

@strong{Note:} The API for prepared statements is still subject to revision.
This information is provided for early adopters, but please be aware that
the API may change.
Some incompatible changes were made in MySQL 4.1.2.
See @ref{C API Prepared statement functions} for details.

Prepared statements mainly use the @code{MYSQL_STMT} and
@code{MYSQL_BIND} data structures. A third structure, @code{MYSQL_TIME},
is used to transfer temporal data.

@table @code
@tindex MYSQL_STMT C type

@item MYSQL_STMT
This structure represents a prepared statement.
A statement is created by calling @code{mysql_stmt_init()},
which returns a statement handle, that is, a pointer to a
@code{MYSQL_STMT}.
The handle is used for all subsequent statement-related functions. 

The @code{MYSQL_STMT} structure has no members that are for application
use.

Multiple statement handles can be associated with a single connection.
The limit on the number of handles depends on the available system resources.

@tindex MYSQL_BIND C type
@item MYSQL_BIND
This structure is used both for query input (data values sent to the server)
and output (result values returned from the server). For input, it is used with
@code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()} to bind parameter data values to
buffers for use by @code{mysql_stmt_execute()}. For output, it is
used with @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()} to bind result set
buffers for use in fetching rows with @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}.

@noindent
The @code{MYSQL_BIND} structure contains the following members for
use by application programs.
Each is used both for input and for output, though sometimes for different
purposes depending on the direction of data transfer.

@table @code
@item enum enum_field_types buffer_type
The type of the buffer. The allowable @code{buffer_type} values are listed
later in this section. For input, @code{buffer_type} indicates what type of
value you are binding to a query parameter. For output, it indicates what type
of value you expect to receive in a result buffer.

@item void *buffer
For input, this is a pointer to the buffer in which a query parameter's data
value is stored. For output, it is
a pointer to the buffer in which to return a result set column value.
For numeric column types, @code{buffer} should point to a variable of the proper
C type.
(If you are associating the variable with a column that has the
@code{UNSIGNED} attribute, the variable should be an @code{unsigned} C type.)
For date and time column types, @code{buffer} should point to a
@code{MYSQL_TIME} structure.  For character and binary string column types,
@code{buffer} should point to a character buffer.

@item unsigned long buffer_length
The actual size of @code{*buffer} in bytes. This indicates the maximum amount
of data that can be stored in the buffer. For character and binary C data,
the @code{buffer_length} value specifies the length of @code{*buffer}
when used with @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()},
or the maximum number of data bytes that can be fetched into the buffer
when used with @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}.

@item unsigned long *length
A pointer to an @code{unsigned long} variable that indicates the actual number
of bytes of data stored in @code{*buffer}.
@code{length} is used for character or binary C data.
For input parameter data binding, @code{length}
points to an @code{unsigned long} variable that indicates the
length of the parameter value stored in @code{*buffer}; this is used by
@code{mysql_stmt_execute()}.
If @code{length} is a null pointer, the protocol assumes
that all character and binary data are null-terminated.
For output value binding, @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} places
the length of the column value that is returned
into the variable that @code{length} points to.

@code{length}
is ignored for numeric and temporal data types because the length
of the data value is determined by the @code{buffer_type} value.

@item my_bool *is_null
This member points to a @code{my_bool} variable that is true if a value is
@code{NULL}, false if it is not @code{NULL}. For input, set @code{*is_null}
to true to
indicate that you are passing a @code{NULL} value as a query parameter. For
output, this value will be set to true after you fetch a row if the result
value returned from the query is @code{NULL}.
@end table

@tindex MySQL C type
@item MYSQL_TIME
This structure is used to send and receive @code{DATE}, @code{TIME},
@code{DATETIME}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} data directly to and from the server.
This is done by setting the @code{buffer_type} member of a @code{MYSQL_BIND}
structure to one of the temporal types, and setting the @code{buffer} member
to point to a @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure.

@noindent
The @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure contains the following members:

@c TODO: rather than say TIME for the hour item (which doesn't make much
@c sense; don't minute/second apply, too), say for each temporal type
@c which structure members are used for it.

@item unsigned int month
The month of the year.

@item unsigned int day
The day of the month.

@item unsigned int hour

@item unsigned int minute
The minute of the hour.

@item unsigned int second
The second of the minute.

@item my_bool neg
A boolean flag to indicate whether the time is negative.

@item unsigned long second_part
The fractional part of the second.
This member currently is unused.

@end table

@c TODO: does neg only to TIME/TIMESTAMP?
@c TODO: second_part probably applies only to TIMESTAMP?

Only those parts of a @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure that apply to a given
type of temporal value are used:
The @code{year}, @code{month}, and @code{day} elements are used for
@code{DATE}, @code{DATETIME}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} values.
The @code{hour}, @code{minute}, and @code{second} elements are used for
@code{TIME}, @code{DATETIME}, and @code{TIMESTAMP} values.

The following table shows the allowable values that may be specified in the

Call @code{mysql_stmt_init()} to create a statement
handle, then @code{mysql_stmt_prepare} to prepare it, 
@code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()} to supply the parameter
data, and @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} to execute the query. You can
repeat the @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} by changing parameter values in the
respective buffers supplied through @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()}.

If the query is a @code{SELECT} statement or any other query that produces
a result set, @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} will also return the result
set metadata information in the form of a @code{MYSQL_RES} result set 
through @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}.

You can supply the result buffers using @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}, so
that the @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} will automatically return data to these
buffers. This is row-by-row fetching.

You can also send the text or binary data in chunks to server using
@code{mysql_stmt_send_long_data()}.  @xref{mysql_stmt_send_long_data}.

When statement execution has been completed, the statement handle must be
closed using @code{mysql_stmt_close()} so that all resources associated
with it can be freed.

If you obtained a @code{SELECT} statement's result set metadata by calling
@code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}, you should also free it using
@code{mysql_stmt_free_result()}.

@subsubheading Execution Steps

To prepare and execute a statement, an application follows these steps:

@enumerate
@item
Create a prepared statement handle with @code{msyql_stmt_init()}.
Call @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} and pass it a string containing the SQL
statement to prepare the statement on the server.
@item
If the query produces a result set, call @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}
to obtain the result set metadata.  This metadata is itself in the form of
result set, albeit a separate one from the one that contains the rows returned
by the query. The metadata result set indicates how many columns are in the
result and contains information about each column.
@item
Set the values of any parameters using @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()}. All
parameters must be set. Otherwise, query execution will return an error or
produce unexpected results.
@item
Call @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} to execute the statement.
@item
If the query produces a result set,
bind the data buffers to use for retrieving the row values by calling
@code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}.
@item
Fetch the data into the buffers row by row by calling
@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} repeatedly until no more rows are found.
@item
Repeat steps 3 through 6 as necessary, by changing the parameter values and
re-executing the statement.

@end enumerate

When @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} is called, the MySQL client/server protocol
performs these actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The server parses the query and sends the okay status back to the client by
assigning a statement ID. It also sends total number of parameters,
a column count, and its meta information if it is a result set oriented
query. All syntax and semantics of the query are checked by the server
during this call.
@item
The client uses this statement ID for the further operations, so that the server
can identify the statement from among its pool of statements.
@end itemize

When @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} is called, the MySQL
client/server protocol performs these actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The client uses the statement handle and sends the parameter data to the
server.
@item
The server identifies the statement using the ID provided by the client,
replaces the parameter markers with the newly supplied data, and executes
the query. If the query produces a result set, the server sends the data back to
the client. Otherwise, it sends an okay status and total number of rows
changed, deleted, or inserted.
@end itemize

When @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} is called, the MySQL client/server protocol
performs these actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The client reads the data from the packet row by row and places it into the
application data buffers by doing the necessary conversions. If the
application buffer type is same as that of the field type returned from the
server, the conversions are straightforward.
@end itemize

You can get the statement error code, error message, and SQLSTATE value using
@code{mysql_stmt_errno()}, @code{mysql_stmt_error()}, and
@code{mysql_stmt_sqlstate()}, respectively.


@node C API Prepared statement functions, C API multiple queries, C API Prepared statement function overview, C
@subsection C API Prepared Statement Function Descriptions

To prepare and execute queries, use the functions in the following sections.

@strong{Note:} The API for prepared statements is still subject to revision.
This information is provided for early adopters, but please be aware that
the API may change.

In MySQL 4.1.2, the names of several prepared statement functions were
changed:

@multitable @columnfractions .30 .70
@item @strong{Old Name}           @tab @strong{New Name}
@item @code{mysql_bind_param()}     @tab @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()}
@item @code{mysql_bind_result()}    @tab @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}
@item @code{mysql_prepare()}        @tab @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()}
@item @code{mysql_execute()}        @tab @code{mysql_stmt_execute()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch()}          @tab @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch_column()}   @tab @code{mysql_stmt_fetch_column()}
@item @code{mysql_param_count()}    @tab @code{mysql_stmt_param_count()}

@item @code{mysql_get_metadata()} @tab @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}
@item @code{mysql_send_long_data()} @tab @code{mysql_stmt_send_long_data()}
@end multitable

Now all functions that operate with a @code{MYSQL_STMT} structure begin with
the prefix @code{mysql_stmt_}.

Also in 4.1.2, the signature of the @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} function was
changed to @code{int mysql_stmt_prepare(MYSQL_STMT *stmt, const char *query,
unsigned long length)}.  To create a @code{MYSQL_STMT} handle, you should
use the @code{mysql_stmt_init()} function.

@subsubheading Description

@code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()} is used to bind data for the parameter markers
in the SQL statement that was passed to @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()}. It uses
@code{MYSQL_BIND} structures to supply the data. @code{bind} is the address
of an array of @code{MYSQL_BIND} structures.
The client library expects the array to contain an element for each
@samp{?} parameter marker that is present in the query.

Suppose that you prepare the following statement:

@example
INSERT INTO mytbl VALUES(?,?,?)
@end example

When you bind the parameters, the array of @code{MYSQL_BIND} structures must
contain three elements, and can be declared like this:

@example
MYSQL_BIND bind[3];
@end example

The members of each @code{MYSQL_BIND} element that should be set are described
in @ref{C API Prepared statement datatypes}.

@code{my_bool mysql_stmt_bind_result(MYSQL_STMT *stmt, MYSQL_BIND *bind)}

@subsubheading Description

@code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()} is used to associate (bind) columns in the
result set to data buffers and length buffers. When
@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} is
called to fetch data, the MySQL client/server protocol places the data for the
bound columns into the specified buffers.

Note that all columns must be bound to buffers prior to calling
@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}.
@code{bind} is the address of an array of @code{MYSQL_BIND} structures.
The client library expects the array to contain
an element for each column of the result set.
Otherwise, @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} simply ignores
the data fetch. Also, the buffers should be large enough to hold the
data values, because the protocol doesn't return data values in chunks.

A column can be bound or rebound at any time, even after a result set has been
partially retrieved.  The new binding takes effect the next time
@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} is called. Suppose that an application binds
the columns in a result set and calls @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}.
The client/server
protocol returns data in the bound buffers. Then suppose the application
binds the columns to a different set of buffers. The protocol does
not place data into the newly bound
buffers until the next call to @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} occurs.

To bind a column, an application calls @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()} and
passes the type, address, and the address of the length buffer.
The members of each @code{MYSQL_BIND} element that should be set are described
in @ref{C API Prepared statement datatypes}.

@subsubsection @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}

@findex @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}

@code{int mysql_stmt_fetch(MYSQL_STMT *stmt)}

@subsubheading Description

@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} returns the next row in the result set. It can
be called only while the result set exists, that is, after a call to
@code{mysql_stmt_execute()} that creates a result set or after
@code{mysql_stmt_store_result()}, which is called after
@code{mysql_stmt_execute()} to buffer the entire result set.

@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} returns row data using the buffers bound by
@code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}. It returns
the data in those buffers for all the columns in the current row
set and the lengths are returned to the @code{length} pointer.

Note that all columns must be bound by the application before calling
@code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}.

If a fetched data value is a @code{NULL} value, the @code{*is_null}
value of the corresponding @code{MYSQL_BIND} structure contains TRUE
(1). Otherwise, the data and its length are returned in the @code{*buffer}
and @code{*length} elements based on the buffer type specified by the
application. Each numeric and temporal type has a fixed length,
as listed in the following table.
The length of the string types depends on the length of the actual data value,
as indicated by @code{data_length}.

@code{MYSQL_RES *mysql_stmt_result_metadata(MYSQL_STMT *stmt)}

@subsubheading Description

If a statement passed to @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} is one that produces a result
set,
@code{mysql_stmt_rseult_metadata()} returns the result set
metadata in the form of a pointer to a
@code{MYSQL_RES} structure that can be used to process the
meta information such as total number of fields and individual field
information. This result set pointer can be passed as an argument to
any of the field-based API functions that process result set metadata, such
as:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{mysql_num_fields()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch_field()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch_field_direct()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch_fields()}
@item @code{mysql_field_count()}
@item @code{mysql_field_seek()}
@item @code{mysql_field_tell()}
@item @code{mysql_free_result()}
@end itemize

The result set structure should be freed when you are done with it, which
you can do by passing it to @code{mysql_free_result()}. This is similar
to the way you free a result set obtained from a call to
@code{mysql_store_result()}.

The result set returned by @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()} contains only
metadata. It does not contain any row results. The rows are obtained by using
the statement handle with @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}.


@subsubheading Return Values

A @code{MYSQL_RES} result structure. @code{NULL} if no meta information exists
for the prepared query.

@subsubheading Description

Prepares the SQL query pointed to by the null-terminated string
@code{query}, and returns a statement handle to be used for further operations
on the statement. The query must consist of a single SQL statement. You should
not add a terminating semicolon (@samp{;}) or @code{\g} to the statement.

The application can include one or more parameter markers in the SQL
statement by embedding question mark (@samp{?}) characters into the SQL
string at the appropriate positions.

The markers are legal only in certain places in SQL statements. For
example, they are allowed in the @code{VALUES()} list of an @code{INSERT}
statement (to specify column values for a row), or in a comparison with a
column in a @code{WHERE} clause to specify a comparison value.
However, they are not allowed for identifiers (such as table or column
names), in the select list that names the columns to
be returned by a @code{SELECT} statement), or to specify both
operands of a binary operator such as the @code{=} equal sign.
The latter restriction is necessary because it
would be impossible to determine the parameter type. In general,
parameters are legal only in Data Manipulation Languange (DML)
statements, and not in Data Defination Language (DDL) statements.

The parameter markers must be bound to application variables using
@code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()} before executing the statement.

@code{my_bool mysql_stmt_send_long_data(MYSQL_STMT *stmt, unsigned int
parameter_number, const char *data, unsigned long length)}

@subsubheading Description

Allows an application to send parameter data to the server in pieces
(or ``chunks'').
This function can be called multiple times to send the parts of a
character or binary data value for a column, which must be one of the
@code{TEXT} or @code{BLOB} data types.

@code{parameter_number} indicates which parameter to associate the data with.
Parameters are numbered beginning with 0.
@code{data} is a pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent, and
@code{length} indicates the number of bytes in the buffer.

@strong{Note}: The next @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} call will ignore the
bind buffer for all parameters that have been used with
@code{mysql_stmt_send_long_data()} since last
@code{mysql_stmt_execute()} or @code{mysql_stmt_reset()}.

If you want to reset/forget the sent data, you can do it with
@code{mysql_stmt_reset()}. @xref{mysql_stmt_reset}.

@subsubheading Return Values

Zero if the data is sent successfully to server. Non-zero if an error
occurred.

@subsubheading Description

Returns the total number of rows changed, deleted, or inserted by the last
executed statement. May be called immediatlely after @code{mysql_stmt_execute()}
for @code{UPDATE}, @code{DELETE}, or @code{INSERT} statements. For
@code{SELECT} statements, @code{mysql_stmt_affected_rows()} works like
@code{mysql_num_rows()}.

@c TODO: For SELECT, are there any caveats on when you must wait to call
@c this function, such as after all the rows have been fetched or after
@c calling mysql_stmt_store_result()?

@subsubheading Return Values

An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected
or retrieved. Zero indicates that no records were updated for an
@code{UPDATE} statement, no rows matched the @code{WHERE} clause in
the query, or that no query has yet been executed. @minus{}1 indicates that
the query returned an error or that, for a @code{SELECT} query,
@code{mysql_stmt_affected_rows()} was called prior to calling
@code{mysql_stmt_store_result()}.
Because @code{mysql_stmt_affected_rows()}
returns an unsigned value, you can check for @minus{}1 by comparing the
return value to @code{(my_ulonglong)-1} (or to @code{(my_ulonglong)~0},
which is equivalent).

Sets the row cursor to an arbitrary row in a statement result set.
The @code{offset} value is a row offset that should be a value returned
from @code{mysql_stmt_row_tell()} or from @code{mysql_stmt_row_seek()}.
This value is not a row number; if you want to seek to a row within a

@c TODO: this para may not make sense. It's written in parallel with
@c mysql_data_seek(), but there is no corresponding mysql_stmt_use_result().

This function requires that the result set structure contains the entire

successfully produces a result set
(@code{SELECT}, @code{SHOW}, @code{DESCRIBE}, @code{EXPLAIN}), and only
if you want to buffer the complete result set by the client, so that the
subsequent @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()} call returns buffered data.

It is unnecessary to call @code{mysql_stmt_store_result()} for other
queries, but if you do, it will not harm or cause any notable performance.
You can detect whether the query produced a result set by checking
if @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()} returns @code{NULL}.
For more information, refer to @ref{mysql_stmt_result_metadata, ,
@code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}}.

@strong{NOTE:}
MySQL doesn't by default calculate @code{MYSQL_FIELD->max_length} for
all columns in @code{mysql_stmt_store_result()} because calculating this
would slow down @code{mysql_stmt_store_result()} considerably and most
applications doesn't need @code{max_length}.  If you want
@code{max_length} to be updated, you can call
@code{mysql_stmt_attr_set(MYSQL_STMT, STMT_ATTR_UPDATE_MAX_LENGTH, &flag)}
to enable this. @xref{mysql_stmt_attr_set}.

@node C API multiple queries, C API date handling, C API Prepared statement functions, C
@subsection C API Handling of Multiple Query Execution

From version 4.1, MySQL supports the execution of multiple statements
specified in a single query string. To use this capability with a given
connection, you must specify the @code{CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS} option in
the flags parameter of @code{mysql_real_connect()}
when opening the connection.  You can also set this for a connection
by calling @code{mysql_set_server_option(MYSQL_OPTION_MULTI_STATEMENTS_ON)}

By default, @code{mysql_query()} and @code{mysql_real_query()} return
only the first query status and the subsequent queries status can
be processed using @code{mysql_more_results()} and
@code{mysql_next_result()}.

@example

/* Connect to server with option CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS */
mysql_real_connect(..., CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS);

/* Now execute multiple queries */
mysql_query(mysql,"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table;\
                   CREATE TABLE test_table(id INT);\
                   INSERT INTO test_table VALUES(10);\
                   UPDATE test_table SET id=20 WHERE id=10;\
                   SELECT * FROM test_table;\
                   DROP TABLE test_table";

@node C API date handling, C Thread functions, C API multiple queries, C
@subsection C API Handling of Date and Time Values

The new binary protocol available in MySQL 4.1 and above allows you to
send and receive date and time values (@code{DATE}, @code{TIME},
@code{DATETIME}, and @code{TIMESTAMP}), using
the @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure. The members of this structure are described
in @ref{C API Prepared statement datatypes}.

To send temporal data values, you create a prepared statement with
@code{mysql_stmt_prepare()}. Then, before calling
@code{mysql_stmt_execute()} to execute the statement, use the following
procedure to set up each temporal parameter:

@enumerate

@item
In the @code{MYSQL_BIND} structure associated with the data value, set the
@code{buffer_type} member to the type that indicates what kind of temporal
value you're sending. For
@code{DATE},
@code{TIME},
@code{DATETIME},
or
@code{TIMESTAMP}
values, set @code{buffer_type} to
@code{MYSQL_TYPE_DATE},
@code{MYSQL_TYPE_TIME},
@code{MYSQL_TYPE_DATETIME},
or
@code{MYSQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP},
respectively.

@item
Set the @code{buffer} member of the @code{MYSQL_BIND} structure to the address
of the @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure in which you will pass the temporal value.

@item
Fill in the members of the @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure that are appropriate
for the type of temporal value you're passing.
@end enumerate

Use @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()} to bind the parameter data to the statement.
Then you can call @code{mysql_stmt_execute()}.

To retrieve temporal values, the procedure is similar, except that you set
the @code{buffer_type} member to the type of value you expect to receive, and
the @code{buffer} member to the address of a @code{MYSQL_TIME} structure into
which the returned value should be placed.
Use @code{mysql_bind_results()} to bind the buffers to the statement after
calling @code{mysql_stmt_execute()} and before fetching the results.

Here is a simple example that inserts @code{DATE}, @code{TIME}, and
@code{TIMESTAMP} data.
The @code{mysql} variable is assumed to be a valid connection handle.

@example

  MYSQL_TIME  ts;
  MYSQL_BIND  bind[3];
  MYSQL_STMT  *stmt;
  
  strmov(query, "INSERT INTO test_table(date_field, time_field,
                                        timestamp_field) VALUES(?,?,?");

  stmt = mysql_stmt_init(mysql);
  if (!stmt)
  @{
    fprintf(stderr, " mysql_stmt_init(), out of memory\n");
    exit(0);
  @}
  if (mysql_stmt_prepare(mysql, query, strlen(query)))
  @{
    fprintf(stderr, "\n mysql_stmt_prepare(), INSERT failed");
    fprintf(stderr, "\n %s", mysql_stmt_error(stmt));
    exit(0);
  @}

  /* setup input buffers for all 3 parameters */
  bind[0].buffer_type= MYSQL_TYPE_DATE;
  bind[0].buffer= (char *)&ts;  
  bind[0].is_null= 0;
  bind[0].length= 0;
  ..
  bind[1]= bind[2]= bind[0];
  ..

  mysql_stmt_bind_param(stmt, bind);

  /* supply the data to be sent in the ts structure */
  ts.year= 2002;
  ts.month= 02;
  ts.day= 03;

  ts.hour= 10;
  ts.minute= 45;
  ts.second= 20;

  mysql_stmt_execute(stmt);

@subsubsection Why @code{mysql_store_result()} Sometimes Returns @code{NULL} After @code{mysql_query()} Returns Success

It is possible for @code{mysql_store_result()} to return @code{NULL}
following a successful call to @code{mysql_query()}.  When this happens, it
means one of the following conditions occurred:

@itemize @bullet
@item
There was a @code{malloc()} failure (for example, if the result set was too
large).

@item
The data couldn't be read (an error occurred on the connection).

@item
The query returned no data (for example, it was an @code{INSERT},
@code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE}).
@end itemize

You can always check whether the statement should have produced a
non-empty result by calling @code{mysql_field_count()}.  If
@code{mysql_field_count()} returns zero, the result is empty and the last
query was a statement that does not return values (for example, an
@code{INSERT} or a @code{DELETE}).  If @code{mysql_field_count()} returns a
non-zero value, the statement should have produced a non-empty result.
See the description of the @code{mysql_field_count()} function for an
example.

You can test for an error by calling @code{mysql_error()} or
@code{mysql_errno()}.

@node Query results, Getting unique ID, NULL mysql_store_result, C API problems
@subsubsection What Results You Can Get from a Query

In addition to the result set returned by a query, you can also get the
following information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysql_affected_rows()} returns the number of rows affected by the last
query when doing an @code{INSERT}, @code{UPDATE}, or @code{DELETE}. 

In MySQL 3.23, there is an exception when @code{DELETE} is used without
a @code{WHERE} clause. In this case, the table is re-created as an empty
table and @code{mysql_affected_rows()} returns zero for the number of
records affected.  In MySQL 4.0, @code{DELETE} always returns the correct
number of rows deleted. For a fast recreate, use @code{TRUNCATE TABLE}.

@item
@code{mysql_num_rows()} returns the number of rows in a result set.  With
@code{mysql_store_result()}, @code{mysql_num_rows()} may be called as soon as
@code{mysql_store_result()} returns.  With @code{mysql_use_result()},
@code{mysql_num_rows()} may be called only after you have fetched all the
rows with @code{mysql_fetch_row()}.

@item
@code{mysql_insert_id()} returns the ID generated by the last
query that inserted a row into a table with an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} index.
@xref{mysql_insert_id, , @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

@item
Some queries (@code{LOAD DATA INFILE ...}, @code{INSERT INTO
... SELECT ...}, @code{UPDATE}) return additional information.  The result is
returned by @code{mysql_info()}.  See the description for @code{mysql_info()}
for the format of the string that it returns.  @code{mysql_info()} returns a
@code{NULL} pointer if there is no additional information.
@end itemize


@node Getting unique ID, C API linking problems, Query results, C API problems
@subsubsection How to Get the Unique ID for the Last Inserted Row

@cindex unique ID
@cindex last row, unique ID
@cindex ID, unique
@cindex tables, unique ID for last row

If you insert a record into a table that contains an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
column, you can obtain the value stored into that column by calling the
@code{mysql_insert_id()} function.

You can check whether a value was stored into an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column
by executing the following code. This also checks if the query was an
@code{INSERT} with an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} index:

@example
if (mysql_error(&mysql)[0] == 0 &&
    mysql_num_fields(result) == 0 &&
    mysql_insert_id(&mysql) != 0)
@{
    used_id = mysql_insert_id(&mysql);
@}
@end example

For more information, see @ref{mysql_insert_id,  , @code{mysql_insert_id()}}.

When a new @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value has been generated,
you can also obtain it by executing a @code{SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()}
statement @code{mysql_query()} and retrieving the value from the result set
returned by the statement.

For @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()},
the most recently generated ID is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not @code{NULL} and not @code{0}).

If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert
it into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

@example
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
    VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table
@end example

Note that @code{mysql_insert_id()} returns the value stored into an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, whether that value is automatically generated
by storing @code{NULL} or @code{0} or is an explicit value.
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} returns automatically generated @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}
values. If you store an explicit value other than @code{NULL} or @code{0},
it does not affect the value returned by @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}.

When linking with the C API, the following errors may occur on some systems:

If this happens on your system, you must include the math library by
adding @code{-lm} to the end of the compile/link line.

If you compile MySQL clients that you've written yourself or that
you obtain from a third-party, they must be linked using the
@code{-lmysqlclient -lz} option on the link command.  You may also need to
specify a @code{-L} option to tell the linker where to find the library.  For
example, if the library is installed in @file{/usr/local/mysql/lib}, use
@code{-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz} on the link command.

For clients that use MySQL header files, you may need to specify a
@code{-I} option when you compile them (for example,
@code{-I/usr/local/mysql/include}), so the compiler can find the header
files.

To make it simpler to compile MySQL programs on Unix, we have provided the
@code{mysql_config} script for you. @xref{mysql_config, , @code{mysql_config}}.

You can use it to compile a MySQL client as follows:

@example
CFG=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
sh -c "gcc -o progname `$CFG --cflags` progname.c `$CFG --libs`"
@end example

The @code{sh -c} is needed to get the shell not to treat the output from
@code{mysql_config} as one word.

@node Threaded clients, libmysqld, Building clients, C
@subsection How to Make a Threaded Client

@cindex clients, threaded
@cindex threaded clients

The client library is almost thread-safe. The biggest problem is
that the subroutines in @file{net.c} that read from sockets are not
interrupt safe.  This was done with the thought that you might want to
have your own alarm that can break a long read to a server.  If you
install interrupt handlers for the @code{SIGPIPE} interrupt,
the socket handling should be thread-safe.

New in 4.0.16: To not abort the program when a connection terminates,
MySQL blocks @code{SIGPIPE} on the first call to
@code{mysql_server_init}(), @code{mysql_init()} or
@code{mysql_connect()}.  If you want to have your own @code{SIGPIPE}
handler, you should first call @code{mysql_server_init()} and then
install your handler. In older versions of MySQL @code{SIGPIPE} was blocked,
but only in the thread safe client library, for every call to
@code{mysql_init()}.

In the older binaries we distribute on our Web site
(@uref{http://www.mysql.com/}), the client libraries are not normally
compiled with the thread-safe option (the Windows binaries are by
default compiled to be thread-safe). Newer binary distributions should
have both a normal and a thread-safe client library.

To get a threaded client where you can interrupt the client from other
threads and set timeouts when talking with the MySQL server, you should
use the @code{-lmysys}, @code{-lmystrings}, and @code{-ldbug} libraries and
the @code{net_serv.o} code that the server uses.

If you don't need interrupts or timeouts, you can just compile a
thread-safe client library @code{(mysqlclient_r)} and use this.  @xref{C,,
MySQL C API}.  In this case you don't have to worry about the
@code{net_serv.o} object file or the other MySQL libraries.

When using a threaded client and you want to use timeouts and
interrupts, you can make great use of the routines in the
@file{thr_alarm.c} file.  If you are using routines from the
@code{mysys} library, the only thing you must remember is to call
@code{my_init()} first! @xref{C Thread functions}.

All functions except @code{mysql_real_connect()} are by default
thread-safe.  The following notes describe how to compile a thread-safe
client library and use it in a thread-safe manner.  (The notes below for
@code{mysql_real_connect()} actually apply to @code{mysql_connect()} as
well, but because @code{mysql_connect()} is deprecated, you should be
using @code{mysql_real_connect()} anyway.)

To make @code{mysql_real_connect()} thread-safe, you must recompile the
client library with this command:

@example
shell> ./configure --enable-thread-safe-client
@end example

This will create a thread-safe client library @code{libmysqlclient_r}.
(Assuming that your OS has a thread-safe @code{gethostbyname_r()} function.)
This library is thread-safe per connection.  You can let two threads
share the same connection with the following caveats:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Two threads can't send a query to the MySQL server at the same time on
the same connection.  In particular, you have to ensure that between a
@code{mysql_query()} and @code{mysql_store_result()} no other thread is using
the same connection.
@item
Many threads can access different result sets that are retrieved with
@code{mysql_store_result()}.
@item
If you use @code{mysql_use_result}, you have to ensure that no other thread
is using the same connection until the result set is closed.
However, it really is best for threaded clients that share the same
connection to use @code{mysql_store_result()}.
@item
If you want to use multiple threads on the same connection, you must
have a mutex lock around your @code{mysql_query()} and
@code{mysql_store_result()} call combination.  Once
@code{mysql_store_result()} is ready, the lock can be released and other
threads may query the same connection.
@item
If you program with POSIX threads, you can use
@code{pthread_mutex_lock()} and @code{pthread_mutex_unlock()} to
establish and release a mutex lock.
@end itemize

You need to know the following if you have a thread that is calling
MySQL functions which did not create the connection to the
MySQL database:

When you call @code{mysql_init()} or @code{mysql_connect()}, MySQL will
create a thread-specific variable for the thread that is used by the
debug library (among other things).

If you call a MySQL function, before the thread has
called @code{mysql_init()} or @code{mysql_connect()}, the thread will
not have the necessary thread-specific variables in place and you are
likely to end up with a core dump sooner or later.

The get things to work smoothly you have to do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Call @code{my_init()} at the start of your program if it calls
any other MySQL function before calling @code{mysql_real_connect()}.
@item
Call @code{mysql_thread_init()} in the thread handler before calling
any MySQL function.
@item
In the thread, call @code{mysql_thread_end()} before calling
@code{pthread_exit()}.  This will free the memory used by MySQL
thread-specific variables.
@end enumerate

You may get some errors because of undefined symbols when linking your
client with @code{libmysqlclient_r}. In most cases this is because you haven't
included the thread libraries on the link/compile line.

@subsubsection Overview of the Embedded MySQL Server Library

The embedded MySQL server library makes it possible to run a
full-featured MySQL server inside a client application.  The
main benefits are increased speed and more simple management for
embedded applications.

The embedded server library is based on the client/server version of MySQL,
which is written in C/C++. Consequently, the embedded server also
is written in C/C++. There is no embedded server available in other
languages.

The API is identical for the embedded MySQL version and the
client/server version.  To change an old threaded application to use the
embedded library, you normally only have to add calls to the following
functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .70
@item @strong{Function} @tab @strong{When to Call}
@item @code{mysql_server_init()} @tab Should be called before any other MySQL function is called, preferably early in the @code{main()} function.
@item @code{mysql_server_end()} @tab Should be called before your program exits.
@item @code{mysql_thread_init()} @tab Should be called in each thread you create that will access MySQL.
@item @code{mysql_thread_end()} @tab Should be called before calling @code{pthread_exit()}
@end multitable

Then you must link your code with @file{libmysqld.a} instead of @file{libmysqlclient.a}.

The @code{mysql_server_xxx} functions are also included in
@file{libmysqlclient.a} to allow you to change between the embedded and the
client/server version by just linking your application with the right
library. @xref{mysql_server_init, , @code{mysql_server_init()}}.


@node libmysqld compiling, libmysqld restrictions, libmysqld overview, libmysqld
@subsubsection Compiling Programs with @code{libmysqld}

To get a @code{libmysqld} library you should configure MySQL with the
@code{--with-embedded-server} option.

When you link your program with @code{libmysqld}, you must also include
the system-specific @code{pthread} libraries and some libraries that
the MySQL server uses.  You can get the full list of libraries by executing
@code{mysql_config --libmysqld-libs}.

The correct flags for compiling and linking a threaded program
must be used, even if you do not directly call any thread
functions in your code.

@node libmysqld restrictions, libmysqld options, libmysqld compiling, libmysqld
@subsubsection Restrictions when using the Embedded MySQL Server

The embedded server has the following limitations:

@itemize @bullet
@item
No support for @code{ISAM} tables. (This is mainly done to make the library smaller)
@item
No user-defined functions (UDFs).
@item
No stack trace on core dump.
@item
No internal RAID support. (This is not normally needed as most OS has
nowadays support for big files).
@item
You cannot set this up as a master or a slave (no replication).
@item
You can't connect to an embedded server from an outside process with
sockets or TCP/IP.
@end itemize

Some of these limitations can be changed by editing the @file{mysql_embed.h}
include file and recompiling MySQL.

@node libmysqld options, libmysqld TODO, libmysqld restrictions, libmysqld
@subsubsection Using Option Files with the Embedded Server

@cindex defaults, embedded

The following is the recommended way to use option files to make it easy
to switch between a client/server application and one where MySQL is
embedded. @xref{Option files}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Put common options in the @code{[server]} section. These will be read by
both MySQL versions.
@item
Put client/server-specific options in the @code{[mysqld]} section.
@item
Put embedded MySQL-specific options in the @code{[embedded]} section.
@item
Put application-specific options in a @code{[ApplicationName_SERVER]}
section.

@item

@subsubsection A Simple Embedded Server Example

This example program and makefile should work without any
changes on a Linux or FreeBSD system.  For other operating
systems, minor changes will be needed.  This example is
designed to give enough details to understand the problem,
without the clutter that is a necessary part of a real
application.

To try out the example, create an @file{test_libmysqld} directory
at the same level as the mysql-4.0 source directory.  Save
the @file{test_libmysqld.c} source and the @file{GNUmakefile} in the
directory, and run GNU @file{make} from inside the @file{test_libmysqld}
directory.

   * You could, of course, modify argc and argv before passing
   * them to this function.  Or you could create new ones in any

@subsubsection Licensing the Embedded Server

The MySQL source code is covered by the GNU @code{GPL} license
(@pxref{GPL license}).  One result of this is that any program
which includes, by linking with @code{libmysqld}, the MySQL
source code must be released as free software (under a license
compatible with the @code{GPL}).

We encourage everyone to promote free software by releasing
code under the @code{GPL} or a compatible license.  For those who
are not able to do this, another option is to purchase a
commercial license for the MySQL code from MySQL AB.

MySQL provides support for ODBC by means of the @code{MyODBC}
program.  This chapter will teach you how to install @code{MyODBC},
and how to use it.  Here, you will also find a list of common programs that
are known to work with @code{MyODBC}.


@node Installing MyODBC, ODBC administrator, ODBC, ODBC
@subsection How to Install MyODBC

@code{MyODBC} 2.50 is a 32-bit ODBC 2.50 specification level 0 (with
level 1 and level 2 features) driver for connecting an ODBC-aware
application to MySQL.  @code{MyODBC} works on Windows 9x, Me, NT, 2000, and XP,
and on most Unix platforms.
@code{MyODBC} 3.51 is an enhanced version with ODBC 3.5x specification
level 1 (complete core API + level 2 features).

@code{MyODBC} is @code{Open Source}, and you can find the newest
version at @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html}.
Please note that the 2.50.x versions are @code{LGPL} licensed,
whereas the 3.51.x versions are @code{GPL} licensed.

If you have problem with @code{MyODBC} and your program also works
with OLEDB, you should try the OLEDB driver.

Normally you only need to install @code{MyODBC} on Windows machines.
You only need @code{MyODBC} for Unix if you have a program like
ColdFusion that is running on the Unix machine and uses ODBC to connect
to the databases.

If you want to install @code{MyODBC} on a Unix box, you will also need
an ODBC manager.  @code{MyODBC} is known to work with
most of the Unix ODBC managers.

To install @code{MyODBC} on Windows, you should download the
appropriate @code{MyODBC} @file{.zip} file,
unpack it with @code{WinZip} or some similar program,
and execute the @file{SETUP.EXE} file.

On Windows, NT, and XP you may get the following error when trying to install
@code{MyODBC}:

@example
An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
use ODBC)
@end example

The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing @code{Ignore} to copy the rest
of the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If
this doesn't work, the solution is to restart your computer in ``safe
mode`` (Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts
Windows while restarting), install @code{MyODBC}, and restart to normal
mode.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To make a connection to a Unix box from a Windows box, with an ODBC
application (one that doesn't support MySQL natively), you must
first install @code{MyODBC} on the Windows machine.
@item
The user and Windows machine must have the access privileges to the
MySQL server on the Unix machine.  This is set up with the
@code{GRANT} command. @xref{GRANT,,@code{GRANT}}.
@item
You must create an ODBC DSN entry as follows:

@itemize @minus
@item
Open the Control Panel on the Windows machine.
@item
Double-click the ODBC Data Sources 32-bit icon.
@item
Click the tab User DSN.
@item
Click the button Add.
@item
Select MySQL in the screen Create New Data Source and click
the Finish button.
@item
The MySQL Driver default configuration screen is shown.
@xref{ODBC administrator}.
@end itemize

@item
Now start your application and select the ODBC driver with the DSN you
specified in the ODBC administrator.
@end itemize

Notice that there are other configuration options on the screen of
MySQL (trace, don't prompt on connect, etc) that you can try if
you run into problems.


@node ODBC administrator, MyODBC connect parameters, Installing MyODBC, ODBC
@subsection How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program

@cindex ODBC, administrator

There are three possibilities for specifying the server name on
Windows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use the IP address of the server.
@item
Add a file @file{\windows\lmhosts} with the following information:

@example
ip hostname
@end example

For example:

@example
194.216.84.21 my_hostname
@end example

@item
Configure the PC to use DNS.
@end itemize

An example of how to fill in the @code{ODBC setup}:
@example
Windows DSN name:   test
Description:        This is my test database
MySQL Database:     test
Server:             194.216.84.21
User:               monty
Password:           my_password
Port:
@end example

The value for the @code{Windows DSN name} field is any name that is unique
in your Windows ODBC setup.

You don't have to specify values for the @code{Server}, @code{User},
@code{Password}, or @code{Port} fields in the ODBC setup screen.
However, if you do, the values will be used as the defaults later when
you attempt to make a connection.  You have the option of changing the
values at that time.

If the port number is not given, the default port (@value{defaultport})
is used.

If you specify the option @code{Read options from C:\my.cnf}, the groups
@code{client} and @code{odbc} will be read from the @file{C:\my.cnf} file.
You can use all options that are usable by @code{mysql_options()}.
@xref{mysql_options, , @code{mysql_options()}}.


@node MyODBC connect parameters, ODBC Problems, ODBC administrator, ODBC
@subsection Connect parameters for MyODBC

One can specify the following parameters for @code{MyODBC} on
the @code{[Servername]} section of an @file{ODBC.INI} file or
through  the @code{InConnectionString} argument in the
@code{SQLDriverConnect()} call.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .20 .65
@item @strong{Parameter} @tab @strong{Default Value} @tab @strong{Comment}
@item user @tab ODBC (on Windows) @tab The username used to connect to MySQL.
@item server @tab localhost @tab The hostname of the MySQL server.
@item database @tab @tab The default database.
@item option @tab 0 @tab A integer by which you can specify how @code{MyODBC} should work. See below.
@item port @tab 3306 @tab The TCP/IP port to use if @code{server} is not @code{localhost}.
@item stmt @tab @tab A statement that will be executed when connecting to MySQL
@item password @tab @tab The password for the @code{server} @code{user} combination.
@item socket @tab @tab The socket or Windows pipe to connect to.
@end multitable

The option argument is used to tell @code{MyODBC} that the client isn't 100%
ODBC compliant. On Windows, one normally sets the option flag by
toggling the different options on the connection screen but one can also
set this in the option argument. The following options are listed in the
same order as they appear in the @code{MyODBC} connect screen:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .90
@item @strong{Bit} @tab @strong{Description}
@item 1 @tab The client can't handle that @code{MyODBC} returns the real width of a column.
@item 2 @tab  The client can't handle that MySQL returns the true value of affected rows.  If this flag is set then MySQL returns 'found rows' instead.  You must have MySQL 3.21.14 or newer to get this to work.
@item 4 @tab Make a debug log in c:\myodbc.log.  This is the same as putting @code{MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,c::\myodbc.log} in @file{AUTOEXEC.BAT}
@item 8  @tab Don't set any packet limit for results and parameters.
@item 16 @tab Don't prompt for questions even if driver would like to prompt

@subsection How to Report Problems with MyODBC

@code{MyODBC} has been tested with Access, Admndemo.exe, C++-Builder,
Borland Builder 4, Centura Team Developer (formerly Gupta SQL/Windows),
ColdFusion (on Solaris and NT with svc pack 5), Crystal Reports,
DataJunction, Delphi, ERwin, Excel, iHTML, FileMaker Pro, FoxPro, Notes
4.5/4.6, SBSS, Perl DBD-ODBC, Paradox, Powerbuilder, Powerdesigner 32
bit, VC++, and Visual Basic.

If you know of any other applications that work with @code{MyODBC}, please
send mail to the @code{myodbc} mailing list about this!
@xref{Mailing-list}.

With some programs you may get an error like:
@code{Another user has modifies the record that you have modified}. In most
cases this can be solved by doing one of the following things:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Add a primary key for the table if there isn't one already.
@item
Add a timestamp column if there isn't one already.
@item
Only use double float fields. Some programs may fail when they compare
single floats.
@end itemize

If these strategies don't help, you should generate a @code{MyODBC} trace
file and try to figure out why things go wrong.

@subsection Programs Known to Work with MyODBC

Most programs should work with @code{MyODBC}, but for each of those
listed here, we have tested it ourselves or received confirmation from
some user that it works:

@table @asis
@item @strong{Program}
@strong{Comment}
@cindex Access program

@item Access
To make Access work:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the newest
(version 2.6 or above) Microsoft MDAC (@code{Microsoft Data Access
Components}) from @uref{http://www.microsoft.com/data/}.  This will fix
the following bug in Access: when you export data to MySQL, the
table and column names aren't specified.  Another way to around this bug
is to upgrade to MyODBC Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version
3.23.x, which together provide a workaround for this bug!

You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5)
which can be found here
@uref{http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP}.
This will fix some cases where columns are marked as @code{#deleted#}
in Access.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to apply the
MDAC patch and use MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and above to work around
this problem.
@item
For all Access versions, you should enable the MyODBC option flag
@code{Return matching rows}. For Access 2.0, you should additionally enable
@code{Simulate ODBC 1.0}.
@item
You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able to update.
For maximum portability @code{TIMESTAMP(14)} or simple @code{TIMESTAMP}
is recommended instead of other @code{TIMESTAMP(X)} variations.
@item
You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or updated rows
may show up as @code{#DELETED#}.
@item
Only use @code{DOUBLE} float fields. Access fails when comparing with
single floats.  The symptom usually is that new or updated rows may show
up as @code{#DELETED#} or that you can't find or update rows.
@item
If you are linking a table through MyODBC, which has @code{BIGINT} as
one of the column, then the results will be displayed as @code{#DELETED}. The
work around solution is:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Have one more dummy column with @code{TIMESTAMP} as the data type, preferably
@code{TIMESTAMP(14)}.
@item
Check the @code{'Change BIGINT columns to INT'} in connection options dialog in
ODBC DSN Administrator
@item
Delete the table link from access and re-create it.
@end itemize

It still displays the previous records as @code{#DELETED#}, but newly
added/updated records will be displayed properly.
@item
If you still get the error @code{Another user has changed your data} after
adding a @code{TIMESTAMP} column, the following trick may help you:

Don't use @code{table} data sheet view. Create instead a form with the
fields you want, and use that @code{form} data sheet view.  You should
set the @code{DefaultValue} property for the @code{TIMESTAMP} column to
@code{NOW()}.  It may be a good idea to hide the @code{TIMESTAMP} column
from view so your users are not confused.
@item
In some cases, Access may generate illegal SQL queries that
MySQL can't understand. You can fix this by selecting
@code{"Query|SQLSpecific|Pass-Through"} from the Access menu.
@item
Access on NT will report @code{BLOB} columns as @code{OLE OBJECTS}. If
you want to have @code{MEMO} columns instead, you should change the
column to @code{TEXT} with @code{ALTER TABLE}.
@item
Access can't always handle @code{DATE} columns properly. If you have a problem
with these, change the columns to @code{DATETIME}.
@item
If you have in Access a column defined as @code{BYTE}, Access will try
to export this as @code{TINYINT} instead of @code{TINYINT UNSIGNED}.
This will give you problems if you have values > 127 in the column!
@end itemize

@cindex ADO program
@item ADO
When you are coding with the ADO API and @code{MyODBC} you need to put
attention in some default properties that aren't supported by the
MySQL server.  For example, using the @code{CursorLocation
Property} as @code{adUseServer} will return for the @code{RecordCount
Property} a result of -1. To have the right value, you need to set this
property to @code{adUseClient}, like is showing in the VB code here:

@example
Dim myconn As New ADODB.Connection
Dim myrs As New Recordset
Dim mySQL As String
Dim myrows As Long

myconn.Open "DSN=MyODBCsample"
mySQL = "SELECT * from user"
myrs.Source = mySQL
Set myrs.ActiveConnection = myconn
myrs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
myrs.Open
myrows = myrs.RecordCount

myrs.Close
myconn.Close
@end example

Another workaround is to use a @code{SELECT COUNT(*)} statement
for a similar query to get the correct row count.

@item Active server pages (ASP)
You should use the option flag @code{Return matching rows}.

@item BDE applications
To get these to work, you should set the option flags
@code{Don't optimize column widths} and @code{Return matching rows}.

@cindex Borland Builder 4 program
@item Borland Builder 4
When you start a query you can use the property @code{Active} or use the
method @code{Open}.  Note that @code{Active} will start by automatically
issuing a @code{SELECT * FROM ...} query that may not be a good thing if
your tables are big!
@item ColdFusion (On Unix)
The following information is taken from the ColdFusion documentation:

Use the following information to configure ColdFusion Server for Linux
to use the unixODBC driver with @code{MyODBC} for MySQL data
sources.  Allaire has verified that @code{MyODBC} Version 2.50.26
works with MySQL Version 3.22.27 and ColdFusion for Linux. (Any
newer version should also work.) You can download @code{MyODBC} at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html}

@cindex ColdFusion program
ColdFusion Version 4.5.1 allows you to us the ColdFusion Administrator
to add the MySQL data source. However, the driver is not
included with ColdFusion Version 4.5.1. Before the MySQL driver
will appear in the ODBC datasources drop-down list, you must build and
copy the @code{MyODBC} driver to
@file{/opt/coldfusion/lib/libmyodbc.so}.

The Contrib directory contains the program @file{mydsn-xxx.zip} which allows
you to build and remove the DSN registry file for the MyODBC driver
on Coldfusion applications.

@cindex DataJunction
@item DataJunction
You have to change it to output @code{VARCHAR} rather than @code{ENUM}, as
it exports the latter in a manner that causes MySQL grief.
@cindex Excel
@item Excel
Works. A few tips:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If you have problems with dates, try to select them as strings using the
@code{CONCAT()} function. For example:
@example
select CONCAT(rise_time), CONCAT(set_time)
    from sunrise_sunset;
@end example
Values retrieved as strings this way should be correctly recognized
as time values by Excel97.

The purpose of @code{CONCAT()} in this example is to fool ODBC into thinking
the column is of ``string type.'' Without the @code{CONCAT()}, ODBC knows the
column is of time type, and Excel does not understand that.

Note that this is a bug in Excel, because it automatically converts a
string to a time. This would be great if the source was a text file, but
is plain stupid when the source is an ODBC connection that reports
exact types for each column.
@end itemize
@cindex Word program
@item Word

To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
use the @code{MyODBC} driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Insert rows using the @code{mysql} client command-line tool.
@item
Create a DSN file using the ODBC manager, for example, @file{my} for the db above.
@item
Open the Word application.
@item
Create a blank new documentation.
@item
Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert database.
@item
Press the button Get Data.
@item
At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms Query.
@item
In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file my.
@item
Select the new query.
@item
Select the columns that you want.
@item
Make a filter if you want.
@item
Make a Sort if you want.
@item
Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.
@item
Click Finish.
@item
Click Insert data and select the records.
@item
Click OK and you see the rows in your Word document.
@end itemize

@cindex odbcadmin program
@item odbcadmin
Test program for ODBC.
@cindex Delphi program
@item Delphi
You must use BDE Version 3.2 or newer.  Set the @code{Don't optimize column width}
option field when connecting to MySQL.

Also, here is some potentially useful Delphi code that sets up both an
ODBC entry and a BDE entry for @code{MyODBC} (the BDE entry requires a BDE
Alias Editor that is free at a Delphi Super Page near
you. (Thanks to Bryan Brunton @email{bryan@@flesherfab.com} for this):

@example
fReg:= TRegistry.Create;
  fReg.OpenKey('\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\DocumentsFab', True);
  fReg.WriteString('Database', 'Documents');
  fReg.WriteString('Description', ' ');
  fReg.WriteString('Driver', 'C:\WINNT\System32\myodbc.dll');

  AliasEditor.Add('DocumentsFab','MySQL',Memo1.Lines);
@end example

@cindex C++ Builder
@item C++ Builder
Tested with BDE Version 3.0. The only known problem is that when the table
schema changes, query fields are not updated. BDE, however, does not seem
to recognize primary keys, only the index PRIMARY, though this has not
been a problem.

@item Vision
You should use the option flag @code{Return matching rows}.

@cindex Visual Basic
@item Visual Basic
To be able to update a table, you must define a primary key for the table.

Visual Basic with ADO can't handle big integers. This means that some queries
like @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} will not work properly.  The fix is to set
the option @code{OPTION=16384} in the ODBC connect string or to set
the @code{Change BIGINT columns to INT} option in the MyODBC connect screen.
You may also want to set the @code{Return matching rows} option.

@item VisualInterDev
If you get the error @code{[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver does
not support this parameter} the reason may be that you have a
@code{BIGINT} in your result.  Try setting the @code{Change BIGINT
columns to INT} option in the MyODBC connect screen.

@item Visual Objects
You should use the option flag @code{Don't optimize column widths}.

@subsection How to Get the Value of an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} Column in ODBC

@cindex AUTO-INCREMENT, ODBC

A common problem is how to get the value of an automatically generated ID
from an @code{INSERT}. With ODBC, you can do something like this (assuming
that @code{auto} is an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} field):

@example
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
@end example

Or, if you are just going to insert the ID into another table, you can do this:

@example
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');
@end example

@xref{Getting unique ID}.

For the benefit of some ODBC applications (at least Delphi and Access),
the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row:
@example
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL;
@end example

@subsection Reporting Problems with MyODBC

@cindex reporting, MyODBC problems
@cindex problems, ODBC
@cindex MyODBC, reporting problems

If you encounter difficulties with MyODBC, you should start by
making a log file from the ODBC manager (the log you get when requesting
logs from ODBCADMIN) and a MyODBC log.

To get a MyODBC log, you need to do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Ensure that you are using @file{myodbcd.dll} and not @file{myodbc.dll}.
The easiest way to do this is to get @file{myodbcd.dll} from the MyODBC
distribution and copy it over the @file{myodbc.dll}, which is probably
in your @file{C:\windows\system32} or @file{C:\winnt\system32} directory.

Note that you probably want to restore the old @file{myodbc.dll} file when you
have finished testing, as it is a lot faster than @file{myodbcd.dll}.
@item
Select the ``Trace MyODBC'' option in the @code{MyODBC} connect/configure
screen.  The log will be written to the file @file{C:\myodbc.log}.

If the trace option is not remembered the next time you visit this screen,
it means that you are not using the @code{myodbcd.dll}
driver. Reread the previous step to verify that you have installed
@file{myodbcd.dll}.
@item
Start your application and try to get it to fail.
@end enumerate

Check the MyODBC trace file, to find out what could be wrong.
You should be able to determine what statements were issued by searching for
the string @code{>mysql_real_query} in the @file{myodbc.log} file.

You should also try issuing the statements from the @code{mysql} client
program or from @code{admndemo}. This will help you determine whether the
error is in MyODBC or MySQL.

If you find out something is wrong, please only send the relevant rows
(maximum 40 rows) to the @code{myodbc} mailing list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.
Please never send the whole MyODBC or ODBC log file!

If you are unable to find out what's wrong, the last option is to
make an archive in @code{tar} or ZIP format that contains a MyODBC trace file,
the ODBC log file, and a @file{README} file that explains the problem.  You can send this
to @uref{ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/}.  Only we at
MySQL AB will have access to the files you upload, and we will
be very discreet with the data!

If you can create a program that also demonstrates the problem, please include
it in the archive as well.

If the program works with some other SQL server, you should include an ODBC log
file where you do exactly the same thing in the other SQL server.

Remember that the more information you can supply to us, the more
likely it is that we can fix the problem!

The Perl @code{DBI} module provides a generic interface for database access.
You can write a DBI script that works with many different database engines
without change. To use DBI, you must install the @code{DBI} module, as well
as a DataBase Driver (DBD) module for each type of server you want to access.
For MySQL, this driver is the @code{DBD::mysql} module.

Perl DBI is now the recommended Perl interface. It replaces an older
interface called @code{mysqlperl}, which should be considered obsolete.

Installation instructions for Perl DBI support are given in
@ref{Perl support}.

DBI information is available at the command line, online, or in printed form:

@itemize @bullet

This chapter describes a lot of things that you need to know when
working on the MySQL code. If you plan to contribute to MySQL
development, want to have access to the bleeding-edge in-between
versions code, or just want to keep track of development, follow the
instructions in @ref{Installing source tree}.
If you are interested in MySQL internals, you should also subscribe
to our @code{internals} mailing list. This list is relatively low
traffic. For details on how to subscribe, please see
@ref{Mailing-list}.
All developers at MySQL AB are on the @code{internals} list and we
help other people who are working on the MySQL code. Feel free to
use this list both to ask questions about the code and to send
patches that you would like to contribute to the MySQL project!

@subsection MySQL Threads

The MySQL server creates the following threads:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The TCP/IP connection thread handles all connection requests and
creates a new dedicated thread to handle the authentication and
SQL query processing for each connection.

@item
On Windows NT there is a named pipe handler thread that does the same work as
the TCP/IP connection thread on named pipe connect requests.

@item
The signal thread handles all signals.  This thread also normally handles
alarms and calls @code{process_alarm()} to force timeouts on connections
that have been idle too long.

@item
If @code{mysqld} is compiled with @code{-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD}, a dedicated
thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some systems where
there are problems with @code{sigwait()} or if you want to use the
@code{thr_alarm()} code in your application without a dedicated signal
handling thread.

@item
If one uses the @code{--flush_time=#} option, a dedicated thread is created
to flush all tables at the given interval.

@item
Every connection has its own thread.

@item
Every different table on which one uses @code{INSERT DELAYED} gets its
own thread.

@item
If you use @code{--master-host}, a slave replication thread will be
started to read and apply updates from the master.
@end itemize

@code{mysqladmin processlist} only shows the connection, @code{INSERT DELAYED},
and replication threads.

@subsection MySQL Test Suite

@cindex mysqltest, MySQL Test Suite
@cindex testing mysqld, mysqltest

Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on proprietary
customer data and for that reason has not been publicly available. The only
publicly available part of our testing process consisted of the @code{crash-me}
test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the @code{sql-bench} directory, and
miscellaneous tests located in @code{tests} directory. The lack of a
standardized publicly available test suite has made it difficult for our users,
as well developers, to do regression tests on the MySQL code. To address
this problem, we have created a new test system that is included in
Unix source distributions and binary distributions starting with Version
3.23.29.  The tests can be run under Unix, or on Windows in the Cygwin
environment if the server has been compiled under Cygwin. They cannot be
run in a native Windows environment currently.

The current set of test cases doesn't test everything in MySQL, but it
should catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library
issues, and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal
is to have the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions
to our test suite.  You may especially want to contribute tests that
examine the functionality critical to your system, as this will ensure
that all future MySQL releases will work well with your
applications.

@node running mysqltest, extending mysqltest, MySQL test suite, MySQL test suite
@subsubsection Running the MySQL Test Suite

The test system consist of a test language interpreter
(@code{mysqltest}), a shell script to run all
tests(@code{mysql-test-run}), the actual test cases written in a special
test language, and their expected results.  To run the test suite on
your system after a build, type @code{make test} or
@code{mysql-test/mysql-test-run} from the source root.  If you have
installed a binary distribution, @code{cd} to the install root
(eg. @code{/usr/local/mysql}), and do @code{scripts/mysql-test-run}.
All tests should succeed.  If not, you should try to find out why and
report the problem if this is a bug in MySQL.
@xref{Reporting mysqltest bugs}.

If you have a copy of @code{mysqld} running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using
ports @code{9306} and @code{9307}.  If one of those ports is taken, you should
edit @code{mysql-test-run} and change the values of the master and/or slave
port to one that is available.

You can run one individual test case with
@code{mysql-test/mysql-test-run test_name}.

If one test fails, you should test running @code{mysql-test-run} with
the @code{--force} option to check whether any other tests fail.


@node extending mysqltest, Reporting mysqltest bugs, running mysqltest, MySQL test suite
@subsubsection Extending the MySQL Test Suite

You can use the @code{mysqltest} language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it.
You can, however, look at our current test cases and use
them as an example.  The following points should help you get started:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The tests are located in @code{mysql-test/t/*.test}

@item
A test case consists of @code{;} terminated statements and is similar to the
input of @code{mysql} command-line client.  A statement by default is a query
to be sent to MySQL server, unless it is recognized as internal
command (eg. @code{sleep}).

@item
All queries that produce results---for example, @code{SELECT}, @code{SHOW},
@code{EXPLAIN}, etc., must be preceded with @code{@@/path/to/result/file}.  The
file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to generate the result
file is to run @code{mysqltest -r < t/test-case-name.test} from
@code{mysql-test} directory, and then edit the generated result files, if
needed, to adjust them to the expected output.  In that case, be very careful
about not adding or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only
change the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make sure
that the fields are separated by a hard tab, and that there is a hard tab at the end.
You may want to use @code{od -c} to make sure that your text editor has not messed
anything up during edit.  We hope that you will never have to edit the output
of @code{mysqltest -r} as you only have to do it when you find a bug.

@item
To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files in
@code{mysql-test/r} directory and name them @code{test_name.result}.  If the
test produces more than one result, you should use @code{test_name.a.result},
@code{test_name.b.result}, etc.

@item
If a statement returns an error, you should on the line before the statement
specify with the @code{--error error-number}.  The error number can be
a list of possible error numbers separated by @code{','}.

@item
If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the first line of
the test file, put @code{source include/master-slave.inc;}.  To switch between
master and slave, use @code{connection master;} and @code{connection slave;}.
If you need to do something on an alternate connection, you can do
@code{connection master1;} for the master, and @code{connection slave1;} for
the slave.

@item
If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like this:
@example
let $1=1000;
while ($1)
@{
 # do your queries here
 dec $1;
@}
@end example

@item
To sleep between queries, use the @code{sleep} command. It supports fractions
of a second, so you can use @code{sleep 1.3;}, for example, to sleep 1.3
seconds.

@item
To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put them
in the command-line format in @code{mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt}. For
the master, put them in @code{mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt}.

@item
If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case to contribute,
send an email message to the MySQL internals mailing list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.
As this list does not accept
attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files to:

@node Reporting mysqltest bugs,  , extending mysqltest, MySQL test suite
@subsubsection Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite

If your MySQL version doesn't pass the test suite you should
do the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as possible of
what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the @code{mysqlbug} script
so that we can get information about your system and MySQL
version. @xref{Bug reports}.
@item
Make sure to include the output of @code{mysql-test-run}, as well as
contents of all @code{.reject} files in @code{mysql-test/r} directory.
@item
If a test in the test suite fails, check whether the test fails also when run
by its own:

@example
cd mysql-test
mysql-test-run --local test-name
@end example

If this fails, then you should configure MySQL with
@code{--with-debug} and run @code{mysql-test-run} with the
@code{--debug} option. If this also fails send the trace file
@file{var/tmp/master.trace} to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret
so that we can examine it. Please remember to also include a full
description of your system, the version of the mysqld binary and how you
compiled it.

@item
Try also to run @code{mysql-test-run} with the @code{--force} option to
see whether there is any other test that fails.

@item
If you have compiled MySQL yourself, check our manual for how
to compile MySQL on your platform or, preferable, use one of
the binaries we have compiled for you at
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}.  All our standard binaries should
pass the test suite !

@item
If you get an error, like @code{Result length mismatch} or @code{Result
content mismatch} it means that the output of the test didn't match
exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in MySQL or
that your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
circumstances.

Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as the
result file with the @code{.reject} extension.  If your test case is
failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see how
they are different, examine both with @code{od -c} and also check their
lengths.

@section Adding New Functions to MySQL

@cindex functions, new
@cindex adding, new functions
@cindex user-defined functions, adding
@cindex UDFs, defined
@cindex functions, user-defined

There are two ways to add new functions to MySQL:

@itemize @bullet
@item You can add the function through the user-defined function (UDF)
interface.  User-defined functions are added and removed dynamically using
the @code{CREATE FUNCTION} and @code{DROP FUNCTION} statements.
@xref{CREATE FUNCTION, , @code{CREATE FUNCTION}}.

@item You can add the function as a native (built in) MySQL function.
Native functions are compiled into the @code{mysqld} server and become
available on a permanent basis.
@end itemize

Each method has advantages and disadvantages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you write a user-defined function, you must install the object file
in addition to the server itself.  If you compile your function into the
server, you don't need to do that.
@item
You can add UDFs to a binary MySQL distribution.  Native functions
require you to modify a source distribution.
@item
If you upgrade your MySQL distribution, you can continue to use your
previously installed UDFs.  For native functions, you must repeat your
modifications each time you upgrade.
@end itemize

Whichever method you use to add new functions, they may be used just like
native functions such as @code{ABS()} or @code{SOUNDEX()}.

A user-defined function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like native (built in) MySQL function such as
@code{ABS()} and @code{CONCAT()}.

@code{AGGREGATE} is a new option for MySQL Version 3.23.  An
@code{AGGREGATE} function works exactly like a native MySQL
@code{GROUP} function like @code{SUM} or @code{COUNT()}.

@code{CREATE FUNCTION} saves the function's name, type, and shared library
name in the @code{mysql.func} system table.  You must have the
@code{INSERT} and @code{DELETE} privileges for the @code{mysql} database
to create and drop functions.
@c end_description_for_help_topic

All active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless
you start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-grant-tables} option.  In
this case, UDF initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.
(An active function is one that has been loaded with @code{CREATE FUNCTION}
and not removed with @code{DROP FUNCTION}.)

For instructions on writing user-defined functions, see @ref{Adding
functions}.  For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or
C++, your operating system must support dynamic loading and you must have
compiled @code{mysqld} dynamically (not statically).

Note that to make @code{AGGREGATE} work, you must have a
@code{mysql.func} table that contains the column @code{type}.  If you do not
have this table, you should run the script
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} to create it.

For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or C++ and your
operating system must support dynamic loading.  The MySQL source
distribution includes a file @file{sql/udf_example.cc} that defines 5 new
functions.  Consult this file to see how UDF calling conventions work.

For @code{mysqld} to be able to use UDF functions, you should configure MySQL
with @code{--with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic} The reason is that to on
many platforms (including Linux) you can load a dynamic library (with
@code{dlopen()}) from a static linked program, which you would get if
you are using @code{--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static} If you want to
use an UDF that needs to access symbols from @code{mysqld} (like the
@code{metaphone} example in @file{sql/udf_example.cc} that uses
@code{default_charset_info}), you must link the program with
@code{-rdynamic} (see @code{man dlopen}).

If you are using a precompiled version of the server, use MySQL-Max,
which supports dynamic loading.

For each function that you want to use in SQL statements, you should define
corresponding C (or C++) functions.  In the following discussion, the name
``xxx'' is used for an example function name.  To distinguish between SQL and
C/C++ usage, @code{XXX()} (uppercase) indicates an SQL function call, and
@code{xxx()} (lowercase) indicates a C/C++ function call.

The C/C++ functions that you write to implement the interface for
@code{XXX()} are:

@table @asis
@item @code{xxx()} (required)
The main function.  This is where the function result is computed.
The correspondence between the SQL type and return type of your C/C++
function is shown here:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15
@item @strong{SQL Type} @tab @strong{C/C++ Type}
@item @code{STRING}     @tab @code{char *}
@item @code{INTEGER}    @tab @code{long long}
@item @code{REAL}       @tab @code{double}
@end multitable

@item @code{xxx_init()} (optional)
The initialization function for @code{xxx()}.  It can be used to:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Check the number of arguments to @code{XXX()}.
@item
Check that the arguments are of a required type or, alternatively,
tell MySQL to coerce arguments to the types you want when
the main function is called.
@item
Allocate any memory required by the main function.
@item
Specify the maximum length of the result.
@item
Specify (for @code{REAL} functions) the maximum number of decimals.
@item
Specify whether the result can be @code{NULL}.
@end itemize

@item @code{xxx_deinit()} (optional)
The deinitialization function for @code{xxx()}.  It should deallocate any
memory allocated by the initialization function.
@end table

When an SQL statement invokes @code{XXX()}, MySQL calls the
initialization function @code{xxx_init()} to let it perform any required
setup, such as argument checking or memory allocation.  If @code{xxx_init()}
returns an error, the SQL statement is aborted with an error message and the
main and deinitialization functions are not called.  Otherwise, the main
function @code{xxx()} is called once for each row.  After all rows have been
processed, the deinitialization function @code{xxx_deinit()} is called so it
can perform any required cleanup.

For aggregate functions (like @code{SUM()}), you must also provide the
following functions:

@table @asis
@item @code{xxx_reset()} (required)
Reset sum and insert the argument as the initial value for a new group.
@item @code{xxx_add()} (required)
Add the argument to the old sum.
@end table

When using aggregate UDFs, MySQL works the following way:

@enumerate
@item
Call @code{xxx_init()} to let the aggregate function allocate the memory it
will need to store results.
@item
Sort the table according to the @code{GROUP BY} expression.
@item
For the first row in a new group, call the @code{xxx_reset()} function.
@item
For each new row that belongs in the same group, call the
@code{xxx_add()} function.
@item
When the group changes or after the last row has been processed,
call @code{xxx()} to get the result for the aggregate.
@item
Repeat 3-5 until all rows has been processed
@item
Call @code{xxx_deinit()} to let the UDF free any memory it has allocated.
@end enumerate

All functions must be thread-safe (not just the main function,
but the initialization and deinitialization functions as well). This means
that you are not allowed to allocate any global or static variables that
change!  If you need memory, you should allocate it in @code{xxx_init()}
and free it in @code{xxx_deinit()}.


@node UDF calling, UDF aggr. calling, Adding UDF, Adding UDF
@subsubsection UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions

@cindex calling sequences for simple functions, UDF

The main function should be declared as shown here.  Note that the return
type and parameters differ, depending on whether you will declare the SQL
function @code{XXX()} to return @code{STRING}, @code{INTEGER}, or @code{REAL}
in the @code{CREATE FUNCTION} statement:

@noindent
For @code{STRING} functions:

@example
char *xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
          char *result, unsigned long *length,
          char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

@noindent
For @code{INTEGER} functions:

@example
long long xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

@noindent
For @code{REAL} functions:

@example
double xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

The initialization and deinitialization functions are declared like this:

@example
my_bool xxx_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message);

void xxx_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid);
@end example

The @code{initid} parameter is passed to all three functions.  It points to a
@code{UDF_INIT} structure that is used to communicate information between
functions.  The @code{UDF_INIT} structure members follow.  The
initialization function should fill in any members that it wishes to change.
(To use the default for a member, leave it unchanged.):

@table @code
@item my_bool maybe_null
@code{xxx_init()} should set @code{maybe_null} to @code{1} if @code{xxx()}
can return @code{NULL}.  The default value is @code{1} if any of the
arguments are declared @code{maybe_null}.

@item unsigned int decimals
The number of decimals.  The default value is the maximum number of decimals in
the arguments passed to the main function.  (For example, if the function is
passed @code{1.34}, @code{1.345}, and @code{1.3}, the default would be 3,
because @code{1.345} has 3 decimals.

@item unsigned int max_length
The maximum length of the string result.  The default value differs depending
on the result type of the function.  For string functions, the default is the
length of the longest argument.  For integer functions, the default is 21
digits.  For real functions, the default is 13 plus the number of decimals
indicated by @code{initid->decimals}.  (For numeric functions, the length
includes any sign or decimal point characters.)

If you want to return a blob, you can set this to 65KB or 16MB; this
memory is not allocated but used to decide which column type to use if
there is a need to temporary store the data.

@item char *ptr
A pointer that the function can use for its own purposes.  For example,
functions can use @code{initid->ptr} to communicate allocated memory
between functions.  In @code{xxx_init()}, allocate the memory and assign it
to this pointer:

@example
initid->ptr = allocated_memory;
@end example

In @code{xxx()} and @code{xxx_deinit()}, refer to @code{initid->ptr} to use
or deallocate the memory.
@end table


@node UDF aggr. calling, UDF arguments, UDF calling, Adding UDF
@subsubsection UDF Calling Sequences for aggregate functions

@cindex calling sequences for aggregate functions, UDF

Here follows a description of the different functions you need to define
when you want to create an aggregate UDF function.

Note that the following function is NOT needed or used by MySQL 4.1.1.
You can keep still have define this function if you want to have your
code work with both MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 4.1.1

@example
char *xxx_reset(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

This function is called when MySQL finds the first row in a new group.
In the function you should reset any internal summary variables and then set
the given argument as the first argument in the group.

In many cases this is implemented internally by reseting all variables
(for example by calling @code{xxx_clear()} and then calling
@code{xxx_add()}.

The following function is only required by MySQL 4.1.1 and above:

@example
char *xxx_clear(UDF_INIT *initid, char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

This function is called when MySQL needs to reset the summary results.
This will be called at the beginning for each new group but can also be
called to reset the values for a query where there was no matching rows.
@code{is_null} will be set to point to @code{CHAR(0)} before calling
@code{xxx_clear()}.

You can use the @code{error} pointer to store a byte if something went
wrong .

@example
char *xxx_add(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
@end example

This function is called for all rows that belongs to the same group,
except for the first row. In this you should add the value in UDF_ARGS
to your internal summary variable.

The @code{xxx()} function should be declared identical as when you
define a simple UDF function. @xref{UDF calling}.

This function is called when all rows in the group has been processed.
You should normally never access the @code{args} variable here but
return your value based on your internal summary variables.

All argument processing in @code{xxx_reset()} and @code{xxx_add()}
should be done identically as for normal UDFs. @xref{UDF arguments}.

The return value handling in @code{xxx()} should be done identically as
for a normal UDF. @xref{UDF return values}.

The pointer argument to @code{is_null} and @code{error} is the same for
all calls to @code{xxx_reset()}, @code{xxx_clear()}, @code{xxx_add()} and
@code{xxx()}.
You can use this to remember that you got an error or if the @code{xxx()}
function should return @code{NULL}. Note that you should not store a string
into @code{*error}!  This is just a 1 byte flag!

@code{is_null} is reset for each group (before calling @code{xxx_clear()}).
@code{error} is never reset.

If @code{is_null} or @code{error} are set after @code{xxx()}, then MySQL
will return @code{NULL} as the result for the group function.

@node UDF arguments, UDF return values, UDF aggr. calling, Adding UDF
@subsubsection Argument Processing

@cindex argument processing
@cindex processing, arguments

The @code{args} parameter points to a @code{UDF_ARGS} structure that has the
members listed here:

@table @code
@item unsigned int arg_count
The number of arguments.  Check this value in the initialization function
if you want your function to be called with a particular number of arguments.
For example:

@example
if (args->arg_count != 2)
@{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires two arguments");
    return 1;
@}
@end example


@item enum Item_result *arg_type
The types for each argument.  The possible type values are
@code{STRING_RESULT}, @code{INT_RESULT}, and @code{REAL_RESULT}.

To make sure that arguments are of a given type and return an
error if they are not, check the @code{arg_type} array in the initialization
function.  For example:

@example
if (args->arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT ||
    args->arg_type[1] != INT_RESULT)
@{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires a string and an integer");
    return 1;
@}
@end example

As an alternative to requiring your function's arguments to be of particular
types, you can use the initialization function to set the @code{arg_type}
elements to the types you want.  This causes MySQL to coerce
arguments to those types for each call to @code{xxx()}.  For example, to
specify coercion of the first two arguments to string and integer, do this in
@code{xxx_init()}:

@example
args->arg_type[0] = STRING_RESULT;
args->arg_type[1] = INT_RESULT;
@end example

@item char **args
@code{args->args} communicates information to the initialization function
about the general nature of the arguments your function was called with.  For a
constant argument @code{i}, @code{args->args[i]} points to the argument
value.  (See below for instructions on how to access the value properly.)
For a non-constant argument, @code{args->args[i]} is @code{0}.
A constant argument is an expression that uses only constants, such as
@code{3} or @code{4*7-2} or @code{SIN(3.14)}.  A non-constant argument is an
expression that refers to values that may change from row to row, such as
column names or functions that are called with non-constant arguments.

For each invocation of the main function, @code{args->args} contains the
actual arguments that are passed for the row currently being processed.

Functions can refer to an argument @code{i} as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
An argument of type @code{STRING_RESULT} is given as a string pointer plus a
length, to allow handling of binary data or data of arbitrary length.  The
string contents are available as @code{args->args[i]} and the string length
is @code{args->lengths[i]}.  You should not assume that strings are
null-terminated.

@item
For an argument of type @code{INT_RESULT}, you must cast
@code{args->args[i]} to a @code{long long} value:

@example
long long int_val;
int_val = *((long long*) args->args[i]);
@end example

@item
For an argument of type @code{REAL_RESULT}, you must cast
@code{args->args[i]} to a @code{double} value:

@example
double    real_val;
real_val = *((double*) args->args[i]);
@end example
@end itemize

@item unsigned long *lengths
For the initialization function, the @code{lengths} array indicates the
maximum string length for each argument. You should not change these.
For each invocation of the main function, @code{lengths} contains the
actual lengths of any string arguments that are passed for the row
currently being processed.  For arguments of types @code{INT_RESULT} or
@code{REAL_RESULT}, @code{lengths} still contains the maximum length of
the argument (as for the initialization function).
@end table


@node UDF return values, UDF compiling, UDF arguments, Adding UDF
@subsubsection Return Values and Error Handling

@cindex UDFs, return values
@cindex return values, UDFs
@cindex errors, handling for UDFs
@cindex handling, errors

The initialization function should return @code{0} if no error occurred and
@code{1} otherwise.  If an error occurs, @code{xxx_init()} should store a
null-terminated error message in the @code{message} parameter.  The message
will be returned to the client.  The message buffer is
@code{MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE} characters long, but you should try to keep the
message to less than 80 characters so that it fits the width of a standard
terminal screen.

The return value of the main function @code{xxx()} is the function value, for
@code{long long} and @code{double} functions.  A string functions should
return a pointer to the result and store the length of the string in the
@code{length} arguments.

Set these to the contents and length of the return value.  For example:

@example
memcpy(result, "result string", 13);
*length = 13;
@end example

The @code{result} buffer that is passed to the calc function is 255 byte
big. If your result fits in this, you don't have to worry about memory
allocation for results.

If your string function needs to return a string longer than 255 bytes,
you must allocate the space for it with @code{malloc()} in your
@code{xxx_init()} function or your @code{xxx()} function and free it in
your @code{xxx_deinit()} function.  You can store the allocated memory
in the @code{ptr} slot in the @code{UDF_INIT} structure for reuse by
future @code{xxx()} calls.  @xref{UDF calling}.

To indicate a return value of @code{NULL} in the main function, set
@code{is_null} to @code{1}:

@example
*is_null = 1;
@end example

To indicate an error return in the main function, set the @code{error}
parameter to @code{1}:

@example
*error = 1;
@end example

If @code{xxx()} sets @code{*error} to @code{1} for any row, the function
value is @code{NULL} for the current row and for any subsequent rows
processed by the statement in which @code{XXX()} was invoked.  (@code{xxx()}
will not even be called for subsequent rows.) @strong{Note:} In
MySQL versions prior to 3.22.10, you should set both @code{*error}
and @code{*is_null}:

@example
*error = 1;
*is_null = 1;
@end example


@node UDF compiling,  , UDF return values, Adding UDF
@subsubsection Compiling and Installing User-defined Functions

@cindex compiling, user-defined functions
@cindex UDFs, compiling
@cindex installing, user-defined functions

Files implementing UDFs must be compiled and installed on the host where the
server runs.  This process is described below for the example UDF file
@file{udf_example.cc} that is included in the MySQL source
distribution.  This file contains the following functions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{metaphon()} returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for English.
@item
@code{myfunc_double()} returns the sum of the ASCII values of the
characters in its arguments, divided by the sum of the length of its arguments.
@item
@code{myfunc_int()} returns the sum of the length of its arguments.
@item
@code{sequence([const int])} returns an sequence starting from the given
number or 1 if no number has been given.
@item
@code{lookup()} returns the IP number for a hostname.
@item
@code{reverse_lookup()} returns the hostname for an IP number.
The function may be called with a string @code{'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'} or
four numbers.
@end itemize

A dynamically loadable file should be compiled as a sharable object file,
using a command something like this:

@example
shell> gcc -shared -o udf_example.so myfunc.cc
@end example

You can easily find out the correct compiler options for your system by
running this command in the @file{sql} directory of your MySQL
source tree:

@example
shell> make udf_example.o
@end example

You should run a compile command similar to the one that @code{make} displays,
except that you should remove the @code{-c} option near the end of the line
and add @code{-o udf_example.so} to the end of the line.  (On some systems,
you may need to leave  the @code{-c} on the command.)

Once you compile a shared object containing UDFs, you must install it and
tell MySQL about it. Compiling a shared object from @file{udf_example.cc}
produces a file named something like @file{udf_example.so} (the exact name
may vary from platform to platform). Copy this file to some directory
searched by the dynamic linker @code{ld}, such as @file{/usr/lib} or add the
directory in which you placed the shared object to the linker configuration
file (for example, @file{/etc/ld.so.conf}).

On many systems, you can also set the @code{LD_LIBRARY} or
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable to point at the directory where
you have your UDF function files. The @code{dlopen} manual page tells you
which variable you should use on your system. You should set this in
@code{mysql.server} or @code{mysqld_safe} startup scripts and restart
@code{mysqld}.

After the library is installed, notify @code{mysqld} about the new
functions with these commands:

@example
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION metaphon RETURNS STRING SONAME 'udf_example.so';
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_double RETURNS REAL SONAME 'udf_example.so';
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION myfunc_int RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'udf_example.so';
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION lookup RETURNS STRING SONAME 'udf_example.so';
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION reverse_lookup
    ->        RETURNS STRING SONAME 'udf_example.so';
mysql> CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION avgcost
    ->        RETURNS REAL SONAME 'udf_example.so';
@end example

Functions can be deleted using @code{DROP FUNCTION}:

@example
mysql> DROP FUNCTION metaphon;
mysql> DROP FUNCTION myfunc_double;
mysql> DROP FUNCTION myfunc_int;
mysql> DROP FUNCTION lookup;
mysql> DROP FUNCTION reverse_lookup;
mysql> DROP FUNCTION avgcost;
@end example

The @code{CREATE FUNCTION} and @code{DROP FUNCTION} statements update the
system table @code{func} in the @code{mysql} database.  The function's name,
type and shared library name are saved in the table.  You must have the
@code{INSERT} and @code{DELETE} privileges for the @code{mysql} database
to create and drop functions.

You should not use @code{CREATE FUNCTION} to add a function that has already
been created.  If you need to reinstall a function, you should remove it with
@code{DROP FUNCTION} and then reinstall it with @code{CREATE FUNCTION}.  You
would need to do this, for example, if you recompile a new version of your
function, so that @code{mysqld} gets the new version.  Otherwise, the server
will continue to use the old version.

Active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless you start
@code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-grant-tables} option.  In this case, UDF
initialization is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An active function is
one that has been loaded with @code{CREATE FUNCTION} and not removed with
@code{DROP FUNCTION}.)


@node Adding native function,  , Adding UDF, Adding functions
@subsection Adding a New Native Function

@cindex adding, native functions
@cindex native functions, adding
@cindex functions, native, adding

The procedure for adding a new native function is described here.  Note
that you cannot add native functions to a binary distribution because
the procedure involves modifying MySQL source code.  You must
compile MySQL yourself from a source distribution.  Also note
that if you migrate to another version of MySQL (for example,
when a new version is released), you will need to repeat the procedure
with the new version.

To add a new native MySQL function, follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item
Add one line to @file{lex.h} that defines the function name in the
@code{sql_functions[]} array.
@item
If the function prototype is simple (just takes zero, one, two or three
arguments), you should in lex.h specify SYM(FUNC_ARG#) (where # is the
number of arguments) as the second argument in the
@code{sql_functions[]} array and add a function that creates a function
object in @file{item_create.cc}.  Take a look at @code{"ABS"} and
@code{create_funcs_abs()} for an example of this.

If the function prototype is complicated (for example takes a variable number
of arguments), you should add two lines to @file{sql_yacc.yy}. One
indicates the preprocessor symbol that @code{yacc} should define (this
should be added at the beginning of the file). Then define the function
parameters and add an ``item'' with these parameters to the
@code{simple_expr} parsing rule.  For an example, check all occurrences
of @code{ATAN} in @file{sql_yacc.yy} to see how this is done.
@item
In @file{item_func.h}, declare a class inheriting from @code{Item_num_func} or
@code{Item_str_func}, depending on whether your function returns a number or a
string.
@item
In @file{item_func.cc}, add one of the following declarations, depending
on whether you are defining a numeric or string function:
@example
double   Item_func_newname::val()
longlong Item_func_newname::val_int()
String  *Item_func_newname::Str(String *str)
@end example

If you inherit your object from any of the standard items (like
@code{Item_num_func}), you probably only have to define one of these
functions and let the parent object take care of the other functions.
For example, the @code{Item_str_func} class defines a @code{val()} function
that executes @code{atof()} on the value returned by @code{::str()}.

@item
You should probably also define the following object function:
@example
void Item_func_newname::fix_length_and_dec()
@end example
This function should at least calculate @code{max_length} based on the
given arguments. @code{max_length} is the maximum number of characters
the function may return.  This function should also set @code{maybe_null
= 0} if the main function can't return a @code{NULL} value.  The
function can check whether any of the function arguments can return
@code{NULL} by checking the arguments' @code{maybe_null} variable. You
can take a look at @code{Item_func_mod::fix_length_and_dec} for a
typical example of how to do this.
@end enumerate

All functions must be thread-safe (in other words, don't use any global or
static variables in the functions without protecting them with mutexes).

If you want to return @code{NULL}, from @code{::val()}, @code{::val_int()}
or @code{::str()} you should set @code{null_value} to 1 and return 0.

For @code{::str()} object functions, there are some additional
considerations to be aware of:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{String *str} argument provides a string buffer that may be
used to hold the result. (For more information about the @code{String} type,
take a look at the @file{sql_string.h} file.)
@item
The @code{::str()} function should return the string that holds the result or
@code{(char*) 0} if the result is @code{NULL}.
@item
All current string functions try to avoid allocating any memory unless
absolutely necessary!

@cindex new procedures, adding

In MySQL, you can define a procedure in C++ that can access and
modify the data in a query before it is sent to the client.  The modification
can be done on a row-by-row or @code{GROUP BY} level.

We have created an example procedure in MySQL Version 3.23 to
show you what can be done.

Additionally we recommend you to take a look at @code{mylua}.
With this you can use the LUA language to load a procedure at
runtime into @code{mysqld}.

This appendix lists some common problems and error messages that MySQL users
have encountered.  It describes how to figure out what the causes of problem
are, and what to do to solve them.


@node What is crashing, Common errors, Problems, Problems
@appendixsec How to Determine What Is Causing a Problem

When you run into a problem, the first thing you should do is to find out
which program or piece of equipment is causing it:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you have one of the following symptoms, then it is probably a hardware
problems (like memory, motherboard, CPU, or hard disk) or kernel problem:
@itemize @minus
@item
The keyboard doesn't work.  This can normally be checked by pressing
Caps Lock. If the Caps Lock light doesn't change you have to replace
your keyboard.  (Before doing this, you should try to restart
your computer and check all cables to the keyboard.)
@item
The mouse pointer doesn't move.
@item
The machine doesn't answer to a remote machine's pings.
@item
Other programs that are not related to MySQL don't behave correctly.
@item
Your system restarted unexpectedly. (A faulty user level program should
never be able to take down your system.)
@end itemize

In this case you should start by checking all your cables and run some
diagnostic tool to check your hardware!
You should also check whether there are any patches, updates, or service
packs for your operating system that could likely solve your problem.
Check also that all your libraries (like @code{glibc}) are up to date.

It's always good to use a machine with ECC memory to discover
memory problems early.
@item
If your keyboard is locked up, you may be able to recover by
logging into your machine from another machine and executing
@code{kbd_mode -a}.

@item
Please examine your system log file (@file{/var/log/messages} or similar) for
reasons for your problem.  If you think the problem is in MySQL,
you should also examine MySQL's log files. @xref{Log Files}.

@item
If you don't think you have hardware problems, you should try to find
out which program is causing problems.
Try using @code{top}, @code{ps}, @code{taskmanager}, or some similar program,
to check which program is taking all CPU or is locking the machine.

@item
Use @code{top}, @code{df}, or a similar program to check whether you are out
of memory, disk space, file descriptors, or some other critical resource.

@item
If the problem is some runaway process, you can always try to kill it. If it
doesn't want to die, there is probably a bug in the operating system.
@end itemize

If after you have examined all other possibilities and you have
concluded that the MySQL server or a MySQL client
is causing the problem, it's time to create a bug report for our
mailing list or our support team.  In the bug report, try to give a
very detailed description of how the system is behaving and what you think is
happening. You should also state why you think that MySQL
is causing the problem.  Take into consideration all the situations in
this chapter. State any problems exactly how they appear when you
examine your system. Use the ``copy and paste'' method for any output
and error messages from programs and log files.

Try to describe in detail which program is not working and all
symptoms you see.  We have in the past received many bug reports that
state only ``the system doesn't work.''  This doesn't provide us with any
information about what could be the problem.

If a program fails, it's always useful to know the following information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Has the program in question made a segmentation fault (did it dump core)?
@item
Is the program taking up all available CPU time? Check with @code{top}. Let
the program run for a while, it may simply be evaluating something
computationally intensive.
@item
If the @code{mysqld} server is causing problems, can you get any response
from it with @code{mysqladmin -u root ping} or @code{mysqladmin -u root
processlist}?
@item
What does a client program say when you try to connect to the MySQL server?
(Try with @code{mysql}, for example.) Does the client jam?  Do you get any
output from the program?
@end itemize

When sending a bug report, you should follow the outline
described in @ref{Asking questions}.

@node Gone away, Can not connect to server, Error Access denied, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{MySQL server has gone away}

This section also covers the related @code{Lost connection to server
during query} error.

The most common reason for the @code{MySQL server has gone away} error
is that the server timed out and closed the connection. By default, the
server closes the connection after eight hours if nothing has happened. You
can change the time limit by setting the @code{wait_timeout} variable when
you start @code{mysqld}.
@xref{Server system variables}.

If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again for the client
to do an automatic reconnection.

You normally get one of the the following error codes in this case
(which one you get is operating system-dependent):

@multitable @columnfractions .35 .65
@item @strong{Error Code} @tab @strong{Description}
@item @code{CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR} @tab The client couldn't send a question to the
server.
@item @code{CR_SERVER_LOST} @tab The client didn't get an error when writing
to the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or any answer) to the question.
@end multitable

You will also get an error if someone has killed the running thread with a
@code{KILL} statement or a @code{mysqladmin kill} command.

Another common reason the @code{MySQL server has gone away} error occurs
within an application program is that you tried to run a query after
closing the connection to the server.  This indicates a logic error in the
application that should be corrected.

You can check whether the MySQL server died and restarted by executing
@code{mysqladmin version} and examining the uptime.  If the problem is that
@code{mysqld} crashed, you should concentrate on finding the reason for the
crash.  Start by checking whether issuing the query again kills the server
again. @xref{Crashing}.

You can also get these errors if you send a query to the server that is
incorrect or too large. If @code{mysqld} receives a packet that is too large
or out of order, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and
closes the connection.  If you need big queries (for example, if you are
working with big @code{BLOB} columns), you can increase the query limit by
setting the server's @code{max_allowed_packet} variable, which has a default
value of 1MB.  You may also need to increase the maximum packet size on the
client end.  More information on setting the packet size is given in
@ref{Packet too large}.

You will also get a lost connection if you are sending a packet 16MB or larger
if your client is older than 4.0.8 and your server is 4.0.8 and above, or
the other way around.

If you want to create a bug report regarding this problem, be sure that
you include the following information:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Indicate whether or not the MySQL server died. You can find information
about this in the server error log.
@xref{Crashing}.
@item
If a specific query kills @code{mysqld} and the tables involved were
checked with @code{CHECK TABLE} before you ran the query, can you provide a
reproducible test case?
@xref{Reproduceable test case}.
@item
What is the value of the @code{wait_timeout} system variable in the MySQL
server?  (@code{mysqladmin variables} gives you the value of this variable.)
@item
Have you tried to run @code{mysqld} with the @code{--log} option to
determine whether the problem query appears in the log?
@end itemize

@xref{Asking questions}.


@node Can not connect to server, Old client, Gone away, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Can't connect to [local] MySQL server}

A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the @code{mysqld} server in two
different ways: By using a Unix socket file to connect through a file in the
filesystem (default @file{/tmp/mysql.sock}) or by using TCP/IP, which
connects through a port number.  A Unix socket file connection is faster
than TCP/IP but can be used only when connecting to a server on the same
computer.  A Unix socket file is used if you don't specify a hostname or if
you specify the special hostname @code{localhost}.

If the @code{mysqld} server is running on Windows 9x or Me, you can
connect only via TCP/IP. If the server is running on Windows NT, 2000, or XP and
@code{mysqld} is started with the @code{--enable-named-pipe} option, you
can also connect with named pipes if you run the client on the same host where
the server is running. The name of the named pipe is @code{MySQL} by default.
If you don't give a hostname when connecting to @code{mysqld}, a MySQL
client first will try to connect to the named pipe. If that doesn't
work, it will connect to the TCP/IP port.  You can force the use of named
pipes on Windows by using @code{.} as the hostname.

The error (2002) @code{Can't connect to ...} normally means that there is no
MySQL server running on the system or that you are using an incorrect Unix
socket filename or TCP/IP port number when trying to connect to the
@code{mysqld} server.

Start by checking whether there is a process named @code{mysqld} running on
your server host.  (Use @code{ps} on Unix or the Task Manager on Windows.) If
there is no @code{mysqld} process, you should start one.
@xref{Starting server}.

If a @code{mysqld} process is running, you can check the server by
trying the following commands. The port number or Unix socket filename
might be different in your setup. @code{host_ip} represents the IP number of
the machine where the server is running.

@example
shell> mysqladmin version
shell> mysqladmin variables
shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
shell> mysqladmin -h 'host_ip' version
shell> mysqladmin --protocol=socket --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version
@end example

Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the @code{hostname}
command; these cause the output of @code{hostname} (that is, the current
hostname) to be substituted into the @code{mysqladmin} command.
If you have no @code{hostname} command or are running on Windows, you can
manually type the hostname of your machine (without backquotes) following the
@code{-h} option.
You can also try @code{-h 127.0.0.1} to connect with TCP/IP to the local host.

Here are some reasons the @code{Can't connect to local MySQL server}
error might occur:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysqld} is not running.
@item
You are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads.
If you are running on a system that doesn't have native threads,
@code{mysqld} uses the MIT-pthreads package.  @xref{Which OS}.  However,
not all MIT-pthreads versions support Unix socket files. On a system
without socket file support, you must always specify the hostname explicitly
when connecting to the server. Try using this command to check the
connection to the server:

@example
shell> mysqladmin -h `hostname` version
@end example

@item
Someone has removed the Unix socket file that @code{mysqld} uses (default
@file{/tmp/mysql.sock}).  For example, you might have a @code{cron} job that
removes old files from the @file{/tmp} directory.  You can always run
@code{mysqladmin version} to check whether the Unix socket file that
@code{mysqladmin} is trying to use really exists.  The fix in this case is
to change the @code{cron} job to not remove @file{mysql.sock} or to place
the socket file somewhere else.
@xref{Problems with mysql.sock,  , Problems with @file{mysql.sock}}.
@item
You have started the @code{mysqld} server with
the @code{--socket=/path/to/socket} option but forgotten to tell client
programs the new name of the socket file.  If you change the socket
pathname for the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients.
You can do this by providing the same @code{--socket} option when you run
client programs.
@xref{Problems with mysql.sock,  , Problems with @file{mysql.sock}}.
@item
You are using Linux and one server thread has died (dumped core).  In this case,
you must kill the other @code{mysqld} threads (for example, with the
@code{mysql_zap} script) before you can restart the MySQL
server.  @xref{Crashing}.
@item
The server or client program might not have the proper access privileges for
the directory that holds the Unix socket file or the socket file itself. In
this case, you must either change the access privileges for the directory or
socket file so the server and clients can access them, or restart
@code{mysqld} with a @code{--socket} option that specifies a socket filename
in a directory where the server can create it and where client programs can
access it.
@end itemize

If you get the error message @code{Can't connect to MySQL server on
some_host}, you can try the following things to find out what the
problem is:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Check whether the server is running on that host by executing @code{telnet
some_host 3306} and pressing Enter a couple of times.  (3306 is the default
MySQL port number. Change the value if your server is listening to a different
port.) If there is a MySQL server running and listening to the port, you should
get a response that includes the server's version number.  If you get an
error such as @code{telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection
refused}, then there is no server running on the given port.
@item
If the server is running on the local host, try using @code{mysqladmin -h
localhost variables} to connect using the Unix socket file. Verify the
TCP/IP port number that the server is configured to listen to (it is the
value of the @code{port} variable.)
@item
Make sure that your @code{mysqld} server was not started with the
@code{--skip-networking} option. If it was, you will not be able to connect
to it using TCP/IP.
@end itemize


@node Old client, Password too long, Can not connect to server, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Client does not support authentication protocol}

MySQL 4.1 and up uses an authentication protocal based on a password hashing
algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older clients.
If you upgrade the server to 4.1, attempts to connect to it with an
older client may fail with the following message:

@example
shell> mysql
Client does not support authentication protocol requested
by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
@end example

To solve this problem, you should use one of the following approaches:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Upgrade all client programs to use a 4.1.1 or newer client library.
@item
Use an account that still has a pre-4.1-style password when connecting to
the server with a pre-4.1 client program.
@item
Reset the password to pre-4.1 style for each user that needs to use a
pre-4.1 client program. This can be done using the @code{SET PASSWORD}
statement:

@example
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR
    -> 'some_user'@@'some_host' = OLD_PASSWORD('mypass');
@end example

Alternatively, use @code{UPDATE} and @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES}:

@example
mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = OLD_PASSWORD('mypass')
    -> WHERE Host = 'some_host' AND User = 'some_user';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example

Substitute the password you want to use for ``mypass'' in the preceding
example.  MySQL cannot tell you what the original password was, so you'll
need to pick a new one.

@item
Tell the server to use the older password hashing algorithm:
@enumerate
@item
Start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--old-passwords} option.
@item
Assign an old-format password to each account that has had its password
updated to the longer 4.1 format. You can identify these accounts with the
following query:

@example
mysql> SELECT Host, User, Password FROM mysql.user
    -> WHERE LENGTH(Password) > 16;
@end example

For each such account, use the @code{Host} and @code{User} values and assign
a password using the @code{OLD_PASSWORD()} function and either @code{SET PASSWORD} or @code{UPDATE}, as described
earlier.
@end enumerate
@end itemize

For additional background on password hashing and authentication, see
@ref{Password hashing}.


@node Password too long, Blocked host, Old client, Common errors
@appendixsubsec Password Fails When Entered Interactively

MySQL client programs prompt for a password when invoked with a
@code{--password} or @code{-p} option that has no following password value:

@example
shell> mysql -u user_name -p
Enter password:
@end example

On some systems, you may find that your password works when specified in an
option file or on the command line, but not when you enter it interactively
at the @code{Enter password:} prompt. This occurs when the library provided
by the system to read passwords limits password values to a small number of
characters (typically eight).  To work around this, change your password to
a value that is eight or fewer characters long.


@node Blocked host, Too many connections, Password too long, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Host '...' is blocked}

If you get the following error, it means that @code{mysqld} has received many
connect requests from the host @code{'host_name'} that have been
interrupted in the middle:

@example
Host 'host_name' is blocked because of many connection errors.
Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'
@end example

The number of interrupted connect requests allowed is determined by the
value of the @code{max_connect_errors} system variable.  After
@code{max_connect_errors} failed requests, @code{mysqld} assumes that
something is wrong (for example, that someone is trying to break in), and
blocks the host from further connections until you execute a
@code{mysqladmin flush-hosts} command or issue a @code{FLUSH HOSTS}
statement.
@xref{Server system variables}.

By default, @code{mysqld} blocks a host after 10 connection errors.
You can adjust the value by starting the server like this:

@example
shell> mysqld_safe --max_connect_errors=10000 &
@end example

Note that if you get this error message for a given host, you should first
verify that there isn't anything wrong with TCP/IP connections from that
host.  If you are having network problems, it won't do you any good to
increase the value of the @code{max_connect_errors} variable.


@node Too many connections, Non-transactional tables, Blocked host, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Too many connections}

If you get a @code{Too many connections} error when you try to connect to
the @code{mysqld} server, this means that there are already
@code{max_connections} clients connected to it.

If you need to support more than the default maximum number of connections
(100), you should restart @code{mysqld} with a bigger value for the
@code{max_connections} variable.

Note that @code{mysqld} actually allows @code{max_connections}+1 clients to
connect.  The extra connection is reserved for use by accounts that have the
@code{SUPER} privilege.  By granting the @code{SUPER} privilege to
administrators and not to normal users (who should not need it), an
administrator can connect to the server and use @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} to
diagnose problems even if the maximum number of clients already are
connected.
@xref{SHOW PROCESSLIST,  , @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}}.

The maximum number of connections MySQL can support depends on the quality of
the thread library on a given platform. Linux or Solaris should be
able to support 500-1000 simultaneous connections, depending on how much
RAM you have and what your clients are doing.


@node Non-transactional tables, Out of memory, Too many connections, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back}

@cindex Non-transactional tables

If you receive the following message when trying to perform a
@code{ROLLBACK}, it means that one or more of the tables you used in the
transaction do not support transactions:

@example
Warning: Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back
@end example

These non-transactional tables will not be affected by the @code{ROLLBACK}
statement.

If you were not deliberately mixing transactional and non-transactional
tables within the transaction, the most likely cause for this message is
that a table you thought was transactional actually is not. This can happen
if you try to create a table using a transactional storage engine that is
not supported by your @code{mysqld} server (or that was disabled with a
startup option).  If @code{mysqld} doesn't support a storage engine, it will
instead create the table as a @code{MyISAM} table, which is
non-transactional.

You can check the table type for a table by using either of these statements:

@example
SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tbl_name';
SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name;
@end example

See @ref{SHOW TABLE STATUS,  , @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS}} and
@ref{SHOW CREATE TABLE,  , @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}}.

You can check the storage engines that your @code{mysqld} server supports by
using this statement:

@example
SHOW ENGINES;
@end example

Before MySQL 4.1.2, use the following statement instead and check the value
of the variable that is associated with the storage engine in which you are
interested:

@example
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_%';
@end example

For example, to determine whether the @code{InnoDB} storage engine is
available, check the value of the @code{have_innodb} variable.

See @ref{SHOW ENGINES,  , @code{SHOW ENGINES}} and
@ref{SHOW VARIABLES,  , @code{SHOW VARIABLES}}.


@node Out of memory, Packet too large, Non-transactional tables, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Out of memory}

If you issue a query using the @code{mysql} client program and receive an
error like the following one, it means that @code{mysql} does not
have enough memory to store the entire query result:

@example
mysql: Out of memory at line 42, 'malloc.c'
mysql: needed 8136 byte (8k), memory in use: 12481367 bytes (12189k)
ERROR 2008: MySQL client ran out of memory
@end example

To remedy the problem, first check whether your query is correct. Is it
reasonable that it should return so many rows? If not, correct the query and
try again. Otherwise, you can invoke @code{mysql} with the @code{--quick}
option. This causes it to use the @code{mysql_use_result()} to retrieve the
result set, which places less of a load on the client (but more on the
server).


@node Packet too large, Communication errors, Out of memory, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Packet too large}

A communication packet is a single SQL statement sent to the MySQL server
or a single row that is sent to the client.

In MySQL 3.23, the largest possible packet is 16MB, due to limits in the
client/server protocol. In MySQL 4.0.1 and up, the limit is 1GB.

@c commented out: too vague
@c In MySQL 4.0.1 and up, this is only limited by
@c the amount on memory you have on your server (up to a theoretical
@c maximum of 2GB).

When a MySQL client or the @code{mysqld} server receives a packet bigger
than @code{max_allowed_packet} bytes, it issues a @code{Packet too
large} error and closes the connection.  With some clients, you may also
get a @code{Lost connection to MySQL server during query} error if the
communication packet is too large.

Note that the client and the server each has its own
@code{max_allowed_packet} variable. If you want to handle big packets,
you have to increase this variable both in the client and in the server.

If you are using the @code{mysql} client program, its default
@code{max_allowed_packet} variable is 16MB. That is also the maximum value
before MySQL 4.0. To set a larger value from 4.0 on, start @code{mysql} like
this:

@example
mysql> mysql --max_allowed_packet=32M
@end example

That sets the packet size to 32MB.

The sever's default @code{max_allowed_packet} value is 1MB. You can increase
this if the server needs to handle big queries (for example, if you are
working with big @code{BLOB} columns).  For example, to set the variable to
16MB, start the server like this:

@example
mysql> mysqld --max_allowed_packet=16M
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0, use this syntax instead:

@example
mysql> mysqld --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=16M
@end example

You can also use an option file to set @code{max_allowed_packet}.  For
example, to set the size for the server to 16MB, add the following lines in
an option file:

@example
[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet=16M
@end example

Before MySQL 4.0, use this syntax instead:

@example
[mysqld]
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=16M
@end example

It's safe to increase the value of this variable because the extra memory is
allocated only when needed.  For example, @code{mysqld} allocates more
memory only when you issue a long query or when @code{mysqld} must return a
large result row.  The small default value of the variable is more a
precaution to catch incorrect packets between the client and server and also
to ensure that you don't run out of memory by using large packets
accidentally.

You can also get strange problems with large packets if you are using large
@code{BLOB} values but have not given @code{mysqld} access to enough memory
to handle the query.  If you suspect this is the case, try adding
@code{ulimit -d 256000} to the beginning of the @code{mysqld_safe} script
and restart @code{mysqld}.


@node Communication errors, Full table, Packet too large, Common errors
@appendixsubsec Communication Errors / Aborted Connection

@cindex aborted clients
@cindex aborted connection
@cindex connection, aborted

The server error log can be a useful source of information about connection
problems.
@xref{Error log}.
Starting with MySQL 3.23.40, if you start the server with the
@code{--warnings} option (or @code{--log-warnings} from MySQL 4.0.3 on), you
might find messages like this in your error log:

@example
010301 14:38:23  Aborted connection 854 to db: 'users' user: 'josh'
@end example

If @code{Aborted connections} messages appear in the error log, the cause
can be any of the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The client program did not call @code{mysql_close()} before exiting.
@item
The client had been sleeping more than @code{wait_timeout} or
@code{interactive_timeout} seconds without issing any requests to the server.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item
The client program ended abruptly in the middle of a data transfer.
@end itemize

When any of these things happen, the server increments the
@code{Aborted_clients} status variable.

The server increments the @code{Aborted_connects} status variable when the
following things happen:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A client didn't have privileges to connect to a database.
@item
A client uses a wrong password.
@item
A connection packet doesn't contain the right information.
@item
It takes more than @code{connect_timeout} seconds to get
a connect packet.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@end itemize

Note that if these kinds of things happen, it might indicate that someone is
trying to break into your database!

Other reasons for problems with aborted clients or aborted connections:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use of Ethernet protocol with Linux, both half and full duplex.
Many Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You should test for this
bug by transferring a huge file via FTP between the client and server machines.
If a transfer goes in burst-pause-burst-pause ... mode, you are
experiencing a Linux duplex syndrome.
The only solution is switching the duplex mode for both your network card
and Hub/Switch to either full duplex or to half duplex and testing the
results to determine the best setting.
@item
Some problem with the thread library that causes interrupts on reads.
@item
Badly configured TCP/IP.
@item
Faulty Ethernets, hubs, switches, cables, and so forth. This can be diagnosed
properly only by replacing hardware.
@item
The @code{max_allowed_packet} variable value is too small or queries require
more memory than you have allocated for @code{mysqld}.
@xref{Packet too large}.
@end itemize


@node Full table, Cannot create, Communication errors, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{The table is full}

@cindex table is full

There are several ways a full-table error can occur:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You are using a MySQL server older than 3.23 and an in-memory
temporary table becomes larger than @code{tmp_table_size} bytes.
To avoid this problem, you can use the @code{-O tmp_table_size=#} option
to make @code{mysqld} increase the temporary table size or use the SQL
option @code{SQL_BIG_TABLES} before you issue the problematic query.
@xref{SET OPTION, ,@code{SET}}.

You can also start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--big-tables} option.
This is exactly the same as using @code{SQL_BIG_TABLES} for all queries.

As of MySQL 3.23, this problem should not occur. If an in-memory temporary
table becomes larger than @code{tmp_table_size}, the server automatically
converts it to a disk-based @code{MyISAM} table.
@item
You are using @code{InnoDB} tables and run out of room in the
@code{InnoDB} tablespace. In this case, the solution is to extend the
@code{InnoDB} tablespace.
@xref{Adding and removing}.
@item
You are using @code{ISAM} or @code{MyISAM} tables on an operating system
that supports files only up to 2GB in size and you have hit this limit for the
data file or index file.
@item
You are using a @code{MyISAM} table and the space required for the table
exceeds what is allowed by the internal pointer size.  (If you don't specify
the @code{MAX_ROWS} table option when you create a table, MySQL
uses the @code{myisam_data_pointer_size} system variable. Its default value of
4 bytes is enough to allow only 4GB of data.)
@xref{Server system variables, @code{myisam_data_pointer_size}}.

You can check the maximum data/index sizes by using this statement:
@example
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM database LIKE 'tbl_name';
@end example

You also can use @code{myisamchk -dv /path/to/table-index-file}.

If the pointer size is too small, you can fix the problem by using @code{ALTER
TABLE}:

@example
ALTER TABLE tbl_name MAX_ROWS=1000000000 AVG_ROW_LENGTH=nnn;
@end example

You have to specify @code{AVG_ROW_LENGTH} only for tables with @code{BLOB}
or @code{TEXT} columns; in this case, MySQL can't optimize the space
required based only on the number of rows.

@node Cannot create, Commands out of sync, Full table, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Can't create/write to file}

@cindex can't create/write to file

If you get an error for some queries of the following type, it means
that MySQL can't create a temporary file for the result set in the
temporary directory:

@example
Can't create/write to file '\\sqla3fe_0.ism'.
@end example

The preceding error is a
typical error message for Windows; the Unix error message is similar.
The fix is to start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--tmpdir} option or to
add the option to the @code{[mysqld]} section of your option file.
For example, to specify a directory of @file{C:\temp}, use these lines:

@example
[mysqld]
tmpdir=C:/temp
@end example

The @file{C:\temp} directory must already exist. @xref{Option files}.

Check also the error code that you get with @code{perror}. One reason
the server cannot write to a table is that the filesystem is full:

@example
shell> perror 28
Error code  28:  No space left on device
@end example


@node Commands out of sync, Ignoring user, Cannot create, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Commands out of sync}

@cindex commands out of sync

If you get @code{Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now}
in your client code, you are calling client functions in the wrong order.

This can happen, for example, if you are using @code{mysql_use_result()} and
try to execute a new query before you have called @code{mysql_free_result()}.
It can also happen if you try to execute two queries that return data without
calling @code{mysql_use_result()} or @code{mysql_store_result()} in between.


@node Ignoring user, Cannot find table, Commands out of sync, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Ignoring user}

If you get the following error, it means that when @code{mysqld} was started
or when it reloaded the grant tables, it found an account in the @code{user}
table that had an invalid password.

@code{Found wrong password for user: 'some_user'@@'some_host'; ignoring user}

As a result, the account is simply ignored by the permission system.

The following list indicates possible causes of and fixes for this problem:

@itemize @bullet
@item
You may be running a new version of @code{mysqld} with an old @code{user}
table.  You can check this by executing @code{mysqlshow mysql user} to see
whether the @code{Password} column is shorter than 16 characters. If so, you
can correct this condition by running the @code{scripts/add_long_password}
script.

@item
The account has an old password (eight characters long) and you didn't start
@code{mysqld} with the @code{--old-protocol} option.
Update the account in the @code{user} table to have a new password or
restart @code{mysqld} with the @code{--old-protocol} option.

@item
@findex PASSWORD()
You have specified a password in the @code{user} table without using the
@code{PASSWORD()} function.  Use @code{mysql} to update the account in the
@code{user} table with a new password, making sure to use the @code{PASSWORD()}
function:

@example
mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('your password')
    -> WHERE User='some_user' AND Host='some_host';
@end example

@end itemize


@node Cannot find table, Cannot initialize character set, Ignoring user, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Table 'xxx' doesn't exist}

If you get either of the following errors, it usually means that no table
exists in the current database with the name @code{xxx}:

@example
Table 'xxx' doesn't exist
Can't find file: 'xxx' (errno: 2)
@end example

In some cases, it may be that the table does exist but that you are not
referring to it correctly:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Because MySQL uses directories and files to store databases and
tables, database and table names are case sensitive if they are located on
a filesystem that has case-sensitive filenames.

@item
Even for filesystems that are not case sensitive, such as on Windows, all
references to a given table within a query must use the same lettercase.

@end itemize


You can check which tables you have in the current database with
@code{SHOW TABLES}. @xref{SHOW, , @code{SHOW}}.


@node Cannot initialize character set, Not enough file handles, Cannot find table, Common errors
@appendixsubsec @code{Can't initialize character set xxx}

@cindex multi-byte character sets

You might see an error like this if you have character set problems:

@example
MySQL Connection Failed: Can't initialize character set xxx
@end example

This error can have any of the following causes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The character set is a multi-byte character set and you have no support
for the character set in the client.
In this case, you need to recompile the client by running @code{configure}
with the @code{--with-charset=xxx} or @code{--with-extra-charsets=xxx}
option.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
@code{--with-extra-character-sets=complex}, which enables support for
all multi-byte character sets. @xref{Character sets}.

@item
The character set is a simple character set that is not compiled into
@code{mysqld}, and the character set definition files are not in the place
where the client expects to find them.

In this case, you need to use one of the following methods to solve the problem:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Recompile the client with support for the character set.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.
@item
Specify to the client the directory where the character set definition files
are located. For many clients, you can do this with the
@code{--character-sets-dir} option.
@item
Copy the character definition files to the path where the client expects them
to be.
@end itemize
@end itemize


@node Not enough file handles,  , Cannot initialize character set, Common errors
@appendixsubsec File Not Found

If you get @code{ERROR '...' not found (errno: 23)}, @code{Can't open file:
... (errno: 24)}, or any other error with @code{errno 23} or @code{errno 24}
from MySQL, it means that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for
the MySQL server.  You can use the @code{perror} utility to get a
description of what the error number means:

@example
shell> perror 23
File table overflow
shell> perror 24
Too many open files
shell> perror 11
Resource temporarily unavailable
@end example

The problem here is that @code{mysqld} is trying to keep open too many
files simultaneously.  You can either tell @code{mysqld} not to open so
many files at once or increase the number of file descriptors
available to @code{mysqld}.

To tell @code{mysqld} to keep open fewer files at a time, you can make the
table cache smaller by reducing the value of the @code{table_cache} system
variable (the default value is 64). Reducing the value of
@code{max_connections} also will reduce the number of open files (the
default value is 100).

@tindex ulimit
To change the number of file descriptors available to @code{mysqld}, you can
use the @code{--open-files-limit} option to @code{mysqld_safe} or (as of
MySQL 3.23.30) set the the @code{open_files_limit} system variable.
@xref{Server system variables}.
The easiest way to set these values is to add an option to your option file.
@xref{Option files}.  If you have an old version of @code{mysqld} that
doesn't support setting the open files limit, you can edit the
@code{mysqld_safe} script.  There is a commented-out line @code{ulimit -n
256} in the script.  You can remove the @samp{#} character to uncomment
this line, and change the number @code{256} to affect the number of file
descriptors available to @code{mysqld}.

@code{--open-files-limit} and @code{ulimit} can increase the number of file
descriptors, but only up to the limit imposed by the operating system. There
is also a ``hard'' limit that can only be overridden if you start
@code{mysqld_safe} or @code{mysqld} as @code{root} (just remember that you
also need to start the server with the @code{--user} option in this case).
If you need to increase the operating system limit on the number of file
descriptors available to each process, consult the documentation for your
system.

@strong{Note:} If you run the @code{tcsh} shell, @code{ulimit} will not work!
@code{tcsh} will also report incorrect values when you ask for the current
limits.  In this case, you should start @code{mysqld_safe} using @code{sh}.

When you are linking an application program to use the MySQL client library,
you might get undefined reference errors for symbols that start with @code{mysql_},
such as those shown here:

@example
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o: In function `main':
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0xb): undefined reference to `mysql_init'
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x31): undefined reference to `mysql_real_connect'
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x57): undefined reference to `mysql_real_connect'
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x69): undefined reference to `mysql_error'
/tmp/ccFKsdPa.o(.text+0x9a): undefined reference to `mysql_close'
@end example

You should be able to solve this problem by adding @code{-Ldir_path
-lmysqlclient} at the end of your link command, where @code{dir_path}
represents the pathname of the directory where the client library is
located. To find the correct directory, try this command:

@example
shell> mysql_config --libs
@end example

The command output might indicate other libraries that should be specified
on the link command as well.

If you get @code{undefined reference} errors for the @code{uncompress}
or @code{compress} functions, add @code{-lz} to the end of your
link command and try again.

If you get @code{undefined reference} errors for functions that should
exist on your system, such as @code{connect}, check the manual page for the
function in question to determine which libraries you should add to the link
command.

You might get @code{undefined reference} errors such as the following for
functions that don't exist on your system:

@example
mf_format.o(.text+0x201): undefined reference to `__lxstat'
@end example

This usually means that your MySQL client library was compiled on a system
that is not 100% compatible with yours.  In this case, you should download
the latest MySQL source distribution and compile MySQL yourself.
@xref{Installing source}.

You might get undefined reference errors at runtime when you try to execute
a MySQL program. If these errors indicate symbols that start with
@code{mysql_} or that the @code{mysqlclient} library can't be found, it
means that your system can't find the shared @file{libmysqlclient.so} library.
The fix for this is to tell your system to search for shared
libraries where the library is located. Use whichever of the following methods
is appropriate for your system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Add the path to the directory where @file{libmysqlclient.so} is located to the
@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable.
@item
Add the path to the directory where @file{libmysqlclient.so} is located to the
@code{LD_LIBRARY} environment variable.
@item
Copy @file{libmysqlclient.so} to some directory that is searched by your system,
such as @file{/lib}, and update the shared library information by executing
@code{ldconfig}.
@end itemize

Another way to solve this problem is by linking your program statically with
the @code{-static} option, or by removing the dynamic MySQL libraries
before linking your code. Before trying the second method, you should be
sure that no other programs are using the dynamic libraries.


@node Changing MySQL user, File permissions, Link errors, Installation Issues
@appendixsubsec How to Run MySQL as a Normal User

@cindex starting, @code{mysqld}
@cindex @code{mysqld}, starting

On Windows, you can run the server as a Windows service using normal user
accounts beginning with MySQL 4.0.17 and 4.1.2.  (Older MySQL versions
required you to have administrator rights.  This was a bug introduced in
MySQL 3.23.54).

On Unix, the MySQL server @code{mysqld} can be started and run by any user.
However, you should avoid running the server as the Unix @code{root} user
for security reasons.  To change @code{mysqld} to run as a normal
unprivileged Unix user @code{user_name}, you must do the following:

@enumerate
@item
Stop the server if it's running (use @code{mysqladmin shutdown}).

@item
Change the database directories and files so that @code{user_name} has
privileges to read and write files in them (you might need to do this as
the Unix @code{root} user):

@example
shell> chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir
@end example

If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are symbolic links,
you'll also need to follow those links and change the directories and files
they point to.  @code{chown -R} might not follow symbolic links for you.

@item
Start the server as user @code{user_name}. If you are using MySQL 3.22 or
later, another alternative is to start @code{mysqld} as the Unix @code{root}
user and use the @code{--user=user_name} option.  @code{mysqld} will switch
to run as the Unix user @code{user_name} before accepting any connections.

@item
To start the server as the given user automatically at system
startup time, specify the username by adding a @code{user} option to
the @code{[mysqld]} group of the @file{/etc/my.cnf} option file or the
@file{my.cnf} option file in the server's data directory. For example:

@example
[mysqld]
user=user_name
@end example
@end enumerate

At this point, your @code{mysqld} process should be running as
the Unix user @code{user_name}. One thing hasn't changed, though: the
contents of the grant table in the @code{mysql} database. By default, the
grant tables are initialized such that only the MySQL
@code{root} accounts have permission to access the @code{mysql}
database or to create or drop databases.  Unless you have changed those
permissions, they still hold. This does not stop you from accessing
MySQL as the MySQL @code{root} user when you're logged in
as a Unix user other than @code{root}; just start your
client programs with the @code{--user=root} option.

Note that accessing the MySQL server as the MySQL @code{root} user from
a client program by supplying @code{--user=root} on the command line has
@emph{nothing} to do with MySQL running as the Unix @code{root} user, or,
indeed, as any other Unix user. The access permissions and usernames of MySQL
accounts are completely separate from those of Unix login accounts. The only
connection with Unix usernames is that if you don't provide a @code{--user}
option when you invoke a client program, the client will try to connect
using your Unix login name as your MySQL username.

If your Unix machine itself isn't secured, you should assign passwords
to the MySQL @code{root} accounts in the grant tables.  Otherwise, any
user with a login account on that machine can run @code{mysql} with a
@code{--user=root} option and perform any operation.  (It is a good idea to
assign passwords to MySQL accounts in any case, but especially so when
other login accounts exist on the server host.

@tindex UMASK environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, UMASK
If you have problems with file permissions, the @code{UMASK} environment
variable might be set incorrectly when @code{mysqld} starts.  For example,
MySQL might issue the following error message when you create a table:

@example
ERROR: Can't find file: 'path/with/filename.frm' (Errcode: 13)
@end example

The default umask value is @code{0660}. You can change this behavior by
starting @code{mysqld_safe} as follows:

@example
shell> UMASK=384  # = 600 in octal
shell> export UMASK
shell> /path/to/mysqld_safe &
@end example

@tindex UMASK_DIR environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, UMASK_DIR

By default, MySQL creates database and @code{RAID} directories
with an access permission value of @code{0700}.  You can modify this
behavior by setting the @code{UMASK_DIR} variable. If you set its value, new
directories are created with the combined @code{UMASK} and @code{UMASK_DIR}
values. For example, if you want to give group access to all new
directories, you can do this:

@example
shell> UMASK_DIR=504  # = 770 in octal
shell> export UMASK_DIR
shell> /path/to/mysqld_safe &
@end example

In MySQL 3.23.25 and above, MySQL assumes that the
value for @code{UMASK} and @code{UMASK_DIR} is in octal if it starts
with a zero.

@appendixsubsec What to Do if MySQL Keeps Crashing

@cindex crash, repeated

All MySQL versions are tested on many platforms before they are
released.  This doesn't mean that there are no bugs in
MySQL, but if there are bugs, they should be very few and can be
hard to find.  If you have a problem, it will always help if you try to
find out exactly what crashes your system, as you will have a much better
chance of getting the problem fixed quickly.

First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that the @code{mysqld} server dies or whether your problem has to do with your
client.  You can check how long your @code{mysqld} server has been up by
executing @code{mysqladmin version}.  If @code{mysqld} has died and
restarted, you may find the reason by looking in the server's error log.
@xref{Error log}.

On some systems you can find in the error log a stack trace of where
@code{mysqld} died that you can resolve with the @code{resolve_stack_dump}
program.  @xref{Using stack trace}. Note that the variable values written in
the error log may not always be 100% correct.

Many server crashes are caused by corrupted data files or index files.  MySQL
will update the files on disk with the @code{write()} system call after every
SQL statement and before the client is notified about the result. (This is
not true if you are running with @code{delay_key_write}, in which case the
data is written but not the indexes.) This means that the data is safe even
if @code{mysqld} crashes, because the operating system will ensure that the
unflushed data is written to disk.  You can force MySQL to flush everything
to disk after every SQL statement by starting @code{mysqld} with the
@code{--flush} option.

The preceding means that normally you should not get corrupted tables unless
one of the following happens:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The MySQL server or the server host was killed in the middle of an update.
@item
You have found a bug in @code{mysqld} that caused it to die in the
middle of an update.
@item
Some external program is manipulating data files or index files at the same
time as @code{mysqld} without locking the table properly.
@item
You are running many @code{mysqld} servers using the same data directory on
a system that doesn't support good filesystem locks (normally handled by the
@code{lockd} lock manager), or you are running multiple servers with the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option.
@item
You have a crashed data file or index file that contains very corrupt data that
made @code{mysqld} confused.
@item
You have found a bug in the data storage code. This isn't likely, but it's
at least possible.  In this case, you can try to change the table type to
another storage engine by using @code{ALTER TABLE} on a repaired copy of the
table.
@end itemize

Because it is very difficult to know why something is crashing, first try to
check whether things that work for others crash for you.  Please try
the following things:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Stop the @code{mysqld} server with @code{mysqladmin shutdown}, run
@code{myisamchk --silent --force */*.MYI} from the data directory to check
all @code{MyISAM} tables, and restart @code{mysqld}.  This will ensure that
you are running from a clean state.
 @xref{MySQL Database Administration}.

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--log} option and try to determine
from the information written to the log whether some specific query kills
the server. About 95% of all bugs are related to a particular query.
Normally, this will be one of the last queries in the log file just before
the server restarts.
@xref{Query log}.
If you can repeatedly kill MySQL with a specific query, even
when you have checked all tables just before issuing it, then you
have been able to locate the bug and should submit a bug report for it.
@xref{Bug reports}.

@item
Try to make a test case that we can use to repeat the problem.
@xref{Reproduceable test case}.

@item
Try running the tests in the @file{mysql-test} directory and the MySQL
benchmarks.  @xref{MySQL test suite}.  They should test MySQL
rather well.  You can also add code to the benchmarks that simulates
your application.  The benchmarks can be found in the @file{bench}
directory in the source distribution or, for a binary distribution, in
the @file{sql-bench} directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

@item
Try the @code{fork_big.pl} script.  (It is located in the @file{tests}
directory of source distributions.)

@item
If you configure MySQL for debugging, it will be much easier to
gather information about possible errors if something goes wrong.
Configuring MySQL for debugging causes a safe memory allocator to be
included that can find some errors. It also provides a lot of output
about what is happening.  Reconfigure MySQL with the @code{--with-debug}
or @code{--with-debug=full} option to @code{configure} and then recompile.
@xref{Debugging server}.

@item
Have you applied the latest patches for your operating system?

@item
Use the @code{--skip-external-locking} option to @code{mysqld}.  On some
systems, the @code{lockd} lock manager does not work properly; the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option tells @code{mysqld} not to use external
locking.  (This means that you cannot run two @code{mysqld} servers on the same
data directory and that you must be careful if you use @code{myisamchk}.
Nevertheless, it may be instructive to try the option as a test.)

@item
Have you tried @code{mysqladmin -u root processlist} when @code{mysqld}
appears to be running but not responding?  Sometimes @code{mysqld} is not
comatose even though you might think so.  The problem may be that all
connections are in use, or there may be some internal lock problem.
@code{mysqladmin -u root processlist} usually will be able to make a
connection even in these cases, and can provide useful information about the
current number of connections and their status.

@item
Run the command @code{mysqladmin -i 5 status} or @code{mysqladmin -i 5
-r status} in a separate window to produce statistics while you run
your other queries.

@item
Try the following:
@enumerate
@item
Start @code{mysqld} from @code{gdb} (or another debugger).
@xref{Using gdb on mysqld,  , Using @code{gdb} on @code{mysqld}}.

@item
Run your test scripts.

@item
Print the backtrace and the local variables at the 3 lowest levels. In
@code{gdb} you can do this with the following commands when @code{mysqld}
has crashed inside @code{gdb}:

@example
backtrace
info local
up
info local
up
info local
@end example

With @code{gdb}, you can also examine which threads exist with @code{info
threads} and switch to a specific thread with @code{thread #}, where
@code{#} is the thread ID.
@end enumerate

@item
Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to force
MySQL to crash or misbehave.

@item
Send a normal bug report. @xref{Bug reports}. Be even more detailed
than usual.  Because MySQL works for many people, it may be that the
crash results from something that exists only on your computer (for example,
an error that is related to your particular system libraries).
@item
If you have a problem with tables containing dynamic-length rows and you are
using only @code{VARCHAR} columns (not @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} columns), you
can try to change all @code{VARCHAR} to @code{CHAR} with @code{ALTER
TABLE}.  This will force MySQL to use fixed-size rows.
Fixed-size rows take a little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
corruption.

The current dynamic row code has been in use at MySQL AB for several years
with very few problems, but by nature dynamic-length rows are more prone to
errors, so it may be a good idea to try this strategy to see whether it helps.

@appendixsubsec How to Reset the Root Password

@cindex passwords, forgotten
@cindex passwords, lost
@cindex passwords, resetting
@cindex root user, password resetting

If you have never set a @code{root} password for MySQL, the server will
not require a password at all for connecting as @code{root}. However, it is
recommended to set a password for each account. @xref{Security guidelines}.

If you set a @code{root} password previously, but have forgotten what it
was, you can set a new password. The following procedure is for Windows
systems. The procedure for Unix systems is given later in this section.

The procedure under Windows:

@enumerate
@item
Log onto your system as Administrator.
@item
Stop the MySQL server if it is running. For a server that is running as a
Windows service, go to the Services manager:
@example
Start Menu -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services
@end example
Then find the MySQL service in the list, and stop it.

If your server is not running as a service, you may need to use the Task
Manager to force it to stop.
@item
Open a console window to get to the DOS command prompt:
@example
Start Menu -> Run -> cmd
@end example
@item
We are assuming that you installed MySQL to @file{C:\mysql}. If you installed
MySQL to another location, adjust the following commands accordingly.

At the DOS command prompt, execute this command:
@example
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-nt --skip-grant-tables
@end example
This starts the server in a special mode that does not check the grant
tables to control access.
@item
Keeping the first console window open, open a second console window and
execute the following commands (type each on a single line):
@example
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root
         flush-privileges password "newpwd"
C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
@end example
Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that you want
to use.
The second command will prompt you to enter the new password for access.
Enter the password that you assigned in the first command.
@item
Now you can start the MySQL server in normal mode again.  If you run the
server as a service, start it from the Windows Services window.  If you
start the server manually, use whatever command you normally use.
@end enumerate


In a Unix environment, the procedure is as follows:

@enumerate
@item
Log onto your system as either the Unix @code{root} user or as the
same user that the @code{mysqld} server runs as.
@item
Locate the @file{.pid} file that contains the server's process ID.
The exact location and name of this file depends on your distribution,
hostname, and configuration. Common locations are: @file{/var/lib/mysql/},
@file{/var/run/mysqld/} and @file{/usr/local/mysql/data/}. Generally, the
filename has the extension of @file{.pid} and begins with either
@file{mysqld} or your system's hostname.

Now you can stop the MySQL server by sending a normal @code{kill}
(not @code{kill -9}) to the @code{mysqld} process, using the name of the
@file{.pid} file in the following command:
@example
shell> kill `cat /mysql-data-directory/hostname.pid`
@end example
Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the @code{cat}
command; these cause the output of @code{cat}
to be substituted into the @code{kill} command.
@item
Restart the MySQL server with the special @code{--skip-grant-tables} option:
@example
shell> mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
@end example
@item
Set a new password for the @code{root@@localhost} MySQL account:
@example
shell> mysqladmin -u root flush-privileges password "newpwd"
@end example
Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that you want
to use.
@item
You should now be able to connect using the new password.
@end enumerate

Alternatively, you can set the new password using the @code{mysql} client:
@enumerate
@item
Stop @code{mysqld} and restart it with the @code{--skip-grant-tables}
option as described earlier.
@item
Connect to the @code{mysqld} server with this command:
@example
shell> mysql -u root
@end example
@item
Issue the following statements in the @code{mysql} client:
@example
mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpwd')
    ->                   WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
@end example
Replace ``newpwd'' with the actual @code{root} password that you want
to use.
@item
You should now be able to connect using the new password.
@end enumerate


@node Full disk, Temporary files, Resetting permissions, Administration Issues
@appendixsubsec How MySQL Handles a Full Disk

@cindex full disk
@cindex disk full

@noindent
When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
It checks once every minute to see whether there is enough space to
write the current row. If there is enough space, it continues as if nothing had
happened.
@item
Every six minutes it writes an entry to the log file warning about the
disk-full condition.
@end itemize

@noindent
To alleviate the problem, you can take the following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to insert all records.
@item
To abort the thread, you must send a @code{mysqladmin kill} to the thread.
The thread will be aborted the next time it checks the disk (in one minute).
@item
Note that other threads may be waiting for the table that caused the disk
full condition.  If you have several ``locked'' threads, killing the one
thread that is waiting on the disk-full condition will allow the other
threads to continue.
@end itemize

Exceptions to the preceding behavior are when you use @code{REPAIR TABLE} or
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or when the indexes are created in a batch after
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} or after an @code{ALTER TABLE} statement.
All of these statements may create large temporary files that left to
themselves would cause big problems for the rest of the system.  If the disk
becomes full while MySQL is doing any of these operations,
it will remove the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed.
The exception is that for @code{ALTER TABLE}, the old table will be left
unchanged.


@node Temporary files, Problems with mysql.sock, Full disk, Administration Issues
@appendixsubsec Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files

MySQL uses the value of the @code{TMPDIR} environment variable as the
pathname of the directory in which to store temporary files.  If you don't
have @code{TMPDIR} set, MySQL uses the system default, which is normally
@file{/tmp}, @file{/var/tmp}, or @file{/usr/tmp}.  If the filesystem
containing your temporary file directory is too small, you can use the
@code{--tmpdir} option to @code{mysqld} to specify a directory in a
filesystem where you have enough space.

Starting from MySQL 4.1, the @code{--tmpdir} option can be set to a list
of several paths that are used in round-robin fashion. Paths should be
separated by colon characters (@samp{:}) on Unix and semicolon characters
(@samp{;}) on Windows, NetWare, and OS/2.  @strong{Note:} To spread load
between several physical disks, these paths should end up on different
@strong{physical} disks, not different partitions of the same disk.

If the MySQL server is acting as a replication slave, you should not set
@code{--tmpdir} to point to a directory on a memory-based filesystem or to a
directory that is cleared when the server host restarts.  A replication
slave needs some of its temporary files to survive a machine restart so that
it can replicate temporary tables or @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} operations. If
files in the temporary file directory are lost when the server restarts,
replication will fail.

MySQL creates all temporary files as hidden files. This ensures
that the temporary files will be removed if @code{mysqld} is terminated.  The
disadvantage of using hidden files is that you will not see a big temporary
file that fills up the filesystem in which the temporary file directory is
located.

When sorting (@code{ORDER BY} or @code{GROUP BY}), MySQL normally
uses one or two temporary files. The maximum disk space required is determined
by the following expression:

@example
(length of what is sorted + sizeof(row pointer))
* number of matched rows
* 2
@end example

The row pointer size is usually four bytes, but may grow in the future for
really big tables.

For some @code{SELECT} queries, MySQL also creates temporary SQL
tables. These are not hidden and have names of the form @file{SQL_*}.

@code{ALTER TABLE} creates a temporary table in the same directory as
the original table.

@node Problems with mysql.sock, Timezone problems, Temporary files, Administration Issues
@appendixsubsec How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File @file{/tmp/mysql.sock}

@cindex @code{mysql.sock}, protection
@cindex deletion, @code{mysql.sock}

The default location for the Unix socket file that the server uses for
communication with local clients is @file{/tmp/mysql.sock}.  This might
cause problems, because on some versions of Unix, anyone can delete files
in the @file{/tmp} directory.

On most versions of Unix, you can protect your @file{/tmp} directory so that
files can be deleted only by their owners or the superuser (@code{root}).
To do this, set the @code{sticky} bit on the @file{/tmp} directory by
logging in as @code{root} and using the following command:

@example
shell> chmod +t /tmp
@end example

You can check whether the @code{sticky} bit is set by executing @code{ls -ld
/tmp}.  If the last permission character is @code{t}, the bit is set.

@cindex changing socket location

Another approach is to change the place where the server creates the Unix
socket file. If you do this, you should also let client programs know the
new location of the file.  You can specify the file location in several
ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Specify the path in a global or local option file.
For example, put the following lines in @code{/etc/my.cnf}:

@example
[mysqld]
socket=/path/to/socket

[client]
socket=/path/to/socket
@end example
@xref{Option files}.

@item
Specify a @code{--socket} option on the command line
to @code{mysqld_safe} and when you run client programs.

@item
Set the @code{MYSQL_UNIX_PORT} environment variable to the path of the Unix
socket file.

@item
Recompile MySQL from source to use a different default Unix socket
file location.  Define the path to the file with the
@code{--with-unix-socket-path}  option when you run @code{configure}.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

@end itemize

You can test whether the new socket location works by attempting to connect to
the server with this command:

@example
shell> mysqladmin --socket=/path/to/socket version
@end example

@node Timezone problems,  , Problems with mysql.sock, Administration Issues

@cindex time zone problems
@cindex problems, time zone

@tindex TZ environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, TZ

If you have a problem with @code{SELECT NOW()} returning values in GMT and
not your local time, you have to tell the server your current time zone.
The same applies if @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} returns the wrong value.
This should be done for the environment in which the server runs, for
example, in @code{mysqld_safe} or @code{mysql.server}.
@xref{Environment variables}.

You can set the time zone for the server with the
@code{--timezone=timezone_name} option to @code{mysqld_safe}.  You can
also set it by setting the @code{TZ} environment variable before you
start @code{mysqld}.

The allowable values for @code{--timezone} or @code{TZ} are
system-dependent. Consult your operating system documentation to see
what values are acceptable.

@appendixsubsec Case Sensitivity in Searches

@cindex case sensitivity, in searches
@cindex searching, and case sensitivity
@cindex Chinese
@cindex Big5 Chinese character encoding

By default, MySQL searches are not case sensitive (although there are
some character sets that are never case-insensitive, such as @code{czech}).
This means that if you search with @code{col_name LIKE 'a%'}, you will get all
column values that start with @code{A} or @code{a}. If you want to make this
search case sensitive, make sure that one of the operands is a binary string.
You can do this with the @code{BINARY} operator. Write the condition as either
@code{BINARY col_name LIKE 'a%'} or @code{col_name LIKE BINARY 'a%'}.

If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion,
declare it as @code{BINARY}. @xref{CREATE TABLE, , @code{CREATE TABLE}}.

Simple comparison operations (@code{>=, >, = , < , <=}, sorting and grouping)
are based on each character's ``sort value.'' Characters with the same
sort value (such as @samp{E}, @samp{e} and @samp{@'e}) are treated as the
same character.

If you are using Chinese data in the so-called @code{big5} encoding, you
want to make all character columns @code{BINARY}. This works because the
sorting order of @code{big5} encoding characters is based on the order of
ASCII codes. As of MySQL 4.1, you can explicitly declare that a column should
use the @code{big5} character set:

@example
CREATE TABLE t (name CHAR(40) CHARACTER SET big5);
@end example


@node Using DATE, Problems with NULL, Case sensitivity, Query Issues
@appendixsubsec Problems Using @code{DATE} Columns

@findex DATE

@cindex DATE columns, problems
@cindex problems, @code{DATE} columns

The format of a @code{DATE} value is @code{'YYYY-MM-DD'}. According to
standard SQL, no other format is allowed. You should use this format in
@code{UPDATE} expressions and in the @code{WHERE} clause of @code{SELECT}
statements.  For example:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date >= '2003-05-05';
@end example

As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a number if
the date is used in a numeric context (and vice versa). It is also smart
enough to allow a ``relaxed'' string form when updating and in a @code{WHERE}
clause that compares a date to a @code{TIMESTAMP}, @code{DATE}, or a
@code{DATETIME} column.  (Relaxed form means that any punctuation character
may be used as the separator between parts. For example, @code{'2004-08-15'}
and @code{'2004#08#15'} are equivalent.) MySQL can also convert a
string containing no separators (such as @code{'20040815'}), provided it
makes sense as a date.

The special date @code{'0000-00-00'} can be stored and retrieved as
@code{'0000-00-00'.} When using a @code{'0000-00-00'} date through
Connector/ODBC, it is automatically converted to @code{NULL} in
Connector/ODBC 2.50.12 and above, because ODBC can't handle this kind of
date.

Because MySQL performs the conversions described above, the following
statements work:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES (19970505);
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997.05.05');
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
mysql> INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');

mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= '1997-05-05';
mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= 19970505;
mysql> SELECT MOD(idate,100) FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= 19970505;
mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate >= '19970505';
@end example

@noindent
However, the following will not work:

@example
mysql> SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE STRCMP(idate,'20030505')=0;
@end example

@code{STRCMP()} is a string function, so it converts @code{idate} to a
string in @code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} format and performs a string comparison.
It does not convert @code{'20030505'} to the date @code{'2003-05-05'}
and perform a date comparison.

The MySQL server packs dates for storage, so it can't store a given date
if it would not fit onto the result buffer.  Note that MySQL does very
limited checking whether the date is correct.  If you store an incorrect
date, such as @code{'2004-2-31'}, MySQL stores it as given.  The rules
for accepting a date are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If MySQL can store and retrieve a given date as given, the date is accepted
for @code{DATE} and @code{DATETIME} columns even if it is not strictly legal.
@item
Day values from 0 to 31 are accepted for any date.  This makes it
very convenient for Web applications where you ask year, month and day
in 3 different fields.
@item
The day or month value may be zero.  This is convenient if you want
to store a birthdate in a @code{DATE} column and you only know part
of the date.
@end itemize

@c TODO: change next para when STRICT mode is implemented

If the date cannot be converted to any reasonable value, a @code{0} is
stored in the @code{DATE} column, which will be retrieved as
@code{'0000-00-00'}.  This is both a speed and convenience issue. We believe
that the database server's responsibility is to retrieve the same date you
stored (even if the data was not logically correct in all cases).  We think
it is up to the application and not the server to check the dates.


@node Problems with NULL, Problems with alias, Using DATE, Query Issues
@appendixsubsec Problems with @code{NULL} Values

@cindex @code{NULL} values, vs. empty values

@tindex NULL

The concept of the @code{NULL} value is a common source of confusion for
newcomers to SQL, who often think that @code{NULL} is the same thing as an
empty string @code{''}.  This is not the case. For example, the following
statements are completely different:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
mysql> INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ('');
@end example

Both statements insert a value into the @code{phone} column, but the first
inserts a @code{NULL} value and the second inserts an empty string.  The
meaning of the first can be regarded as ``phone number is not known'' and the
meaning of the second can be regarded as ``the person is known to have no
phone, and thus no phone number.''

To help with @code{NULL} handling, you can use the @code{IS NULL} and
@code{IS NOT NULL} operators and the @code{IFNULL()} function.

In SQL, the @code{NULL} value is never true in comparison to any
other value, even @code{NULL}.  An expression that contains @code{NULL}
always produces a @code{NULL} value unless otherwise indicated in
the documentation for the operators and functions involved in the
expression. All columns in the following example return @code{NULL}:

@example
mysql> SELECT NULL, 1+NULL, CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);
@end example

If you want to search for column values that are @code{NULL}, you
cannot use the @code{=NULL} test. The following statement returns no
rows, because @code{expr = NULL} is never true for any expression:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;
@end example

To look for @code{NULL} values, you must use the @code{IS NULL} test.
The following statements showhow to find the @code{NULL} phone number and the
empty phone number:

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
mysql> SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = '';
@end example

You can add an index on a column that can have @code{NULL}
values only if you are using MySQL 3.23.2 or newer and are using the
@code{MyISAM}, @code{InnoDB}, or @code{BDB} storage engine.
In earlier versions and with other storage engines, you must declare indexed
columns @code{NOT NULL}. This also means you cannot then insert
@code{NULL} into an indexed column.

@findex LOAD DATA INFILE
When reading data with @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}, empty or missing columns
are updated with @code{''}. If you want a @code{NULL} value in a column,
you should use @code{\N} in the data file. The literal word @code{'NULL'}
may also be used under some circumstances.
@xref{LOAD DATA, , @code{LOAD DATA}}.

When using @code{DISTINCT}, @code{GROUP BY}, or @code{ORDER BY}, all
@code{NULL} values are regarded as equal.

When using @code{ORDER BY}, @code{NULL} values are presented first, or
last if you specify @code{DESC} to sort in descending order. Exception:
In MySQL 4.0.2 through 4.0.10, @code{NULL} values sort first
regardless of sort order.

Aggregate (summary) functions such as @code{COUNT()}, @code{MIN()}, and
@code{SUM()} ignore @code{NULL} values. The exception to this is
@code{COUNT(*)}, which counts rows and not individual column values.
For example, the following statement produces two counts.
The first is a count of the number of rows in the table, and the second
is a count of the number of non-@code{NULL} values in the @code{age}
column:

@example
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(age) FROM person;
@end example

@cindex @code{TIMESTAMP}, and @code{NULL} values
@cindex @code{AUTO_INCREMENT}, and @code{NULL} values
@cindex @code{NULL} values, and @code{TIMESTAMP} columns
@cindex @code{NULL} values, and @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns

For some column types, MySQL handles @code{NULL} values specially.  If you
insert @code{NULL} into a @code{TIMESTAMP} column, the
current date and time is inserted.  If you insert @code{NULL} into an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column, the next number in the sequence is inserted.


@node Problems with alias, Deleting from related tables, Problems with NULL, Query Issues
@appendixsubsec Problems with Column Aliases

@tindex alias

You can use an alias to refer to a column in @code{GROUP BY},
@code{ORDER BY}, or @code{HAVING} clauses.  Aliases can also be used
to give columns better names:

@example
SELECT SQRT(a*b) AS rt FROM tbl_name GROUP BY rt HAVING rt > 0;
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name GROUP BY id HAVING cnt > 0;
SELECT id AS 'Customer identity' FROM tbl_name;
@end example

Note that standard SQL doesn't allow you to refer to a column alias in a
@code{WHERE} clause.  This is because when the @code{WHERE} code is
executed, the column value may not yet be determined. For example, the
following query is illegal:

@example
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM tbl_name WHERE cnt > 0 GROUP BY id;
@end example

The @code{WHERE} statement is executed to determine which rows should

MySQL does not support subqueries prior to Version 4.1, or the use of more
than one table in the @code{DELETE} statement prior to Version 4.0. If your
version of MySQL does not support subqueries or multiple-table @code{DELETE}
statements, you can use the following approach to delete rows from two
related tables:

@enumerate
@item
@code{SELECT} the rows based on some @code{WHERE} condition in the main table.
@item
@code{DELETE} the rows in the main table based on the same condition.
@item
@code{DELETE FROM related_table WHERE related_column IN (selected_rows)}.
@end enumerate

If the total length of the @code{DELETE} statement for @code{related_table} is
more than 1MB (the default value of the @code{max_allowed_packet} system
variable), you should split it into smaller parts and execute multiple
@code{DELETE} statements.  You will probably get the fastest @code{DELETE}
by specifying only 100 to 1000 @code{related_column} values per statement if the
@code{related_column} is indexed.  If the @code{related_column} isn't
indexed, the speed is independent of the number of arguments in the
@code{IN} clause.

@appendixsubsec Solving Problems with No Matching Rows

@cindex no matching rows
@cindex rows, matching problems

If you have a complicated query that uses many tables but that doesn't
return any rows, you should use the following procedure to find out what
is wrong:

@enumerate
@item
Test the query with @code{EXPLAIN} to check whether you can find something
that is obviously wrong.
@xref{EXPLAIN, , @code{EXPLAIN}}.

@item
Select only those columns that are used in the @code{WHERE} clause.

@item
Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns some rows.
If the tables are large, it's a good idea to use @code{LIMIT 10} with the query.

@item
Issue a @code{SELECT} for the column that should have matched a row against
the table that was last removed from the query.

@item
If you are comparing @code{FLOAT} or @code{DOUBLE} columns with numbers that
have decimals, you can't use equality (@code{=}) comparisons. This problem
is common in most computer languages because not all floating-point values
can be stored with exact precision.  In some cases, changing the
@code{FLOAT} to a @code{DOUBLE} will fix this.
@xref{Problems with float}.

@item
If you still can't figure out what's wrong, create a minimal test that can
be run with @code{mysql test < query.sql} that shows your problems.  You can
create a test file by dumping the tables with @code{mysqldump --quick
db_name tbl_name_1 ... tbl_name_n > query.sql}. Open the file in an editor,
remove some insert lines (if there are too many of them), and add your
@code{SELECT} statement at the end of the file.

Verify that the test file demonstrates your problem by executing these
commands:

@example
shell> mysqladmin create test2
shell> mysql test2 < query.sql
@end example

Post the test file using @code{mysqlbug} to the general MySQL mailing list.

@appendixsubsec Problems with Floating-point Comparisons

Floating-point numbers sometimes cause confusion because they
are not stored as exact values inside computer architecture. What you
can see on the screen usually is not the exact value of the number.
The column types @code{FLOAT}, @code{DOUBLE} and @code{DECIMAL} are such.
@code{DECIMAL} columns store values with exact precision because they are
represented as strings, but calculations on @code{DECIMAL} values may be done
using floating-point operations.

The following example demonstrate the problem. It shows that even for the
@code{DECIMAL} column type, calculations that are done using floating-point
operations are subject to floating-point error.

@example
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, d1 DECIMAL(9,2), d2 DECIMAL(9,2));
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 101.40, 21.40), (1, -80.00, 0.00),
    -> (2, 0.00, 0.00), (2, -13.20, 0.00), (2, 59.60, 46.40),
    -> (2, 30.40, 30.40), (3, 37.00, 7.40), (3, -29.60, 0.00),
    -> (4, 60.00, 15.40), (4, -10.60, 0.00), (4, -34.00, 0.00),
    -> (5, 33.00, 0.00), (5, -25.80, 0.00), (5, 0.00, 7.20),
    -> (6, 0.00, 0.00), (6, -51.40, 0.00);

mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b
    -> FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a <> b;
+------+--------+-------+
| i    | a      | b     |
+------+--------+-------+
|    1 |  21.40 | 21.40 |
|    2 |  76.80 | 76.80 |
|    3 |   7.40 |  7.40 |
|    4 |  15.40 | 15.40 |
|    5 |   7.20 |  7.20 |
|    6 | -51.40 |  0.00 |
+------+--------+-------+
@end example

The result is correct. Although the first five records look like they
shouldn't pass the comparison test (the values of @code{a} and @code{b} do
not appear to be different), they may do so because the difference between
the numbers shows up around tenth decimal or so, depending on computer
architecture.

The problem cannot be solved by using @code{ROUND()} or similar functions,
because the result is still a floating-point number:

@example
mysql> SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2) AS a, ROUND(SUM(d2), 2) AS b
    -> FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a <> b;
+------+--------+-------+
| i    | a      | b     |
+------+--------+-------+
|    1 |  21.40 | 21.40 |
|    2 |  76.80 | 76.80 |
|    3 |   7.40 |  7.40 |
|    4 |  15.40 | 15.40 |
|    5 |   7.20 |  7.20 |
|    6 | -51.40 |  0.00 |
+------+--------+-------+
@end example

This is what the numbers in column @code{a} look like when displayed with more
decimal places:

@example
mysql> SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2)*1.0000000000000000 AS a,
    -> ROUND(SUM(d2), 2) AS b FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a <> b;
+------+----------------------+-------+
| i    | a                    | b     |
+------+----------------------+-------+
|    1 |  21.3999999999999986 | 21.40 |
|    2 |  76.7999999999999972 | 76.80 |
|    3 |   7.4000000000000004 |  7.40 |
|    4 |  15.4000000000000004 | 15.40 |
|    5 |   7.2000000000000002 |  7.20 |
|    6 | -51.3999999999999986 |  0.00 |
+------+----------------------+-------+
@end example

Depending on your computer architecture, you may or may not see similar
results.  Different CPUs may evaluate floating-point numbers differently.
For example, on some machines you may get the ``correct'' results by
multiplying both arguments by 1, as the following example shows.

@strong{Warning:} Never use this method in your applications. It is not
an example of a trustworthy method!

@example
mysql> SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2)*1 AS a, ROUND(SUM(d2), 2)*1 AS b
    -> FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a <> b;
+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
@end example

The reason that the preceding example seems to work is that on the particular
machine where the test was done, CPU floating-point arithmetic happens to
round the numbers to the same value. However, there is no rule that any CPU
should do so, so this method cannot be trusted.

The correct way to do floating-point number comparison is to first
decide on what is the desired tolerance between the numbers and then do
the comparison against the tolerance value. For example, if we agree
that floating-point numbers should be regarded the same if they are
same within a precision of one in ten thousand (0.0001), the comparison
should be written to find differences larger than the tolerance value:

@example
mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -> GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) > 0.0001;
+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
@end example

Conversely, if we wanted to get rows where the numbers are the same,
the test should find differences within the tolerance value:

@example
mysql> SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -> GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) < 0.0001;
+------+-------+-------+
| i    | a     | b     |
+------+-------+-------+
|    1 | 21.40 | 21.40 |
|    2 | 76.80 | 76.80 |
|    3 |  7.40 |  7.40 |
|    4 | 15.40 | 15.40 |
|    5 |  7.20 |  7.20 |
+------+-------+-------+
@end example

@node Optimiser Issues, Table Definition Issues, Query Issues, Problems
@appendixsec Optimizer-related Issues

MySQL uses a cost-based optimizer to determine the best way to resolve a
query.  In many cases, MySQL can calculate the best possible query plan,
but sometimes MySQL doesn't have enough information about the data
at hand and has to make ``educated'' guesses about the data.

This section is intended for the cases when MySQL doesn't get it right.

The tools you have available to help MySQL do the ``right'' things are:

@appendixsubsec How to Avoid Table Scans

@findex Table scan

The output from @code{EXPLAIN} will show @code{ALL} in the @code{type}
column when MySQL uses a table scan to resolve a query. This usually happens
under the following conditions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The table is so small that it's faster to do a table scan than a key lookup.
This is a common case for tables with fewer than 10 rows and a short row length.
@item
There are no usable restrictions in the @code{ON} or @code{WHERE} clause
for indexed columns.
@item
You are comparing indexed columns with constants and MySQL has
calculated (based on the index tree) that the constants cover too large a
part of the table and that a table scan would be faster.
@xref{Where optimisations}.
@item
You are using a key with low cardinality (many rows match the key value)
through another column.  MySQL will in this case assume that by using the
key it will probably do a lot of key lookups and that a table scan
would be faster.
@end itemize

For small tables, a table scan often is appropriate. For large tables, try
the following techniques to to avoid having the optimizer incorrectly choose
a table scan:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Use @code{ANALYZE TABLE} to update the key distributions for the scanned table.
@xref{ANALYZE TABLE,  , @code{ANALYZE TABLE}}.

@item
Use @code{FORCE INDEX} for the scanned table to tell MySQL that table
scans are very expensive compared to using the given index.
@xref{SELECT,  , @code{SELECT}}.

@example
SELECT * FROM t1,t2 force index(index_for_column)
WHERE t1.column=t2.column;
@end example

@item
Start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--max-seeks-for-key=1000} option or use @code{SET
MAX_SEEKS_FOR_KEY=1000} to tell the optimizer to assume that no key scan
will cause more than 1000 key seeks.

@appendixsubsec Problems with @code{ALTER TABLE}

@tindex ALTER TABLE
@cindex changing, table
@cindex table, changing

@code{ALTER TABLE} changes a table to the current character set.
If you get a duplicate-key error during @code{ALTER TABLE}, the cause
is either that the new character sets maps two keys to the same value
or that the table is corrupted. In the latter case, you should run
@code{REPAIR TABLE} on the table.

If @code{ALTER TABLE} dies with the following error, the problem may be that
MySQL crashed during an earlier @code{ALTER TABLE} operation and there is an
old table named @file{A-something} or @file{B-something} lying around:

@example
Error on rename of './database/name.frm'
to './database/B-a.frm' (Errcode: 17)
@end example

In this case, go to the MySQL data directory and delete all files that have
names starting with @code{A-} or @code{B-}.  (You may want to move them
elsewhere instead of deleting them.)

@code{ALTER TABLE} works the following way:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Create a new table named @file{A-xxx} with the requested structural changes.
@item
Copy all rows from the original table to @file{A-xxx}.
@item
Rename the original table to @file{B-xxx}.
@item
Rename @file{A-xxx} to your original table name.
@item
Delete @file{B-xxx}.
@end itemize

If something goes wrong with the renaming operation, MySQL tries to
undo the changes.  If something goes seriously wrong (although this shouldn't
happen), MySQL may leave the old table as @file{B-xxx}, but a
simple rename of the table files at the system level should get your data back.

If you use @code{ALTER TABLE} on a transactional table or if you are using
Windows or OS/2, @code{ALTER TABLE} will @code{UNLOCK} the table if you had
done a @code{LOCK TABLE} on it. This is because @code{InnoDB} and these
operating systems cannot drop a table that is in use.

@appendixsubsec How to Change the Order of Columns in a Table

@cindex reordering, columns
@cindex columns, changing
@cindex changing, column order
@cindex tables, changing column order

First, consider whether you really need to change the column order in a
table.  The whole point of SQL is to abstract the application from the data
storage format.  You should always specify the order in which you wish to
retrieve your data.  The first of the following statements returns columns
in the order @code{col_name1}, @code{col_name2}, @code{col_name3}, whereas
the second returns them in the order @code{col_name1}, @code{col_name3},
@code{col_name2}:

@example
mysql> SELECT col_name1, col_name2, col_name3 FROM tbl_name;
mysql> SELECT col_name1, col_name3, col_name2 FROM tbl_name;
@end example

If you decide to change the order of table columns anyway, you can do so as
follows:

@enumerate
@item
Create a new table with the columns in the new order.
@item
Execute this statement:

@example
mysql> INSERT INTO new_table
    -> SELECT columns-in-new_table-order FROM old_table;
@end example

@item
Drop or rename @code{old_table}.
@item
Rename the new table to the original name:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME old_table;
@end example

@end enumerate

@code{SELECT *} is quite suitable for testing queries. However, in an
application, you should @emph{never} rely on using @code{SELECT *} and
retrieving the columns based on their position. The order and position
in which columns are returned will not remain the same if you add, move,
or delete columns. A simple change to your table structure will then cause
your application to fail.


@node Temporary table problems,  , Change column order, Table Definition Issues
@appendixsubsec @code{TEMPORARY TABLE} Problems

@cindex temporary tables, problems

The following list indicates limitations on the use of @code{TEMPORARY}
tables:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A @code{TEMPORARY} table can only be of type @code{HEAP}, @code{ISAM},
@code{MyISAM}, @code{MERGE}, or @code{InnoDB}.

@item
You cannot refer to a @code{TEMPORARY} table more than once in the same query.
For example, the following does not work.

@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM temp_table, temp_table AS t2;
ERROR 1137: Can't reopen table: 'temp_table'
@end example

@item
The @code{SHOW TABLES} statement does not list @code{TEMPORARY} tables.

@item
You cannot use @code{RENAME} to rename a @code{TEMPORARY} table.  However,
you can use @code{ALTER TABLE} instead:

@example
mysql> ALTER TABLE orig_name RENAME new_name;
@end example

@appendixsec Contributors to MySQL

@cindex contributors, list of

While @code{MySQL AB} owns all copyrights in the @code{MySQL server}
and the @code{MySQL manual}, we wish to recognize those who have made
contributions of one kind or another to the @code{MySQL distribution}.
Contributors are listed here, in somewhat random order:

@table @asis
@item Gianmassimo Vigazzola @email{qwerg@@mbox.vol.it} or @email{qwerg@@tin.it}
The initial port to Win32/NT.
@item Per Eric Olsson
For more or less constructive criticism and real testing of the dynamic
record format.
@item Irena Pancirov @email{irena@@mail.yacc.it}
Win32 port with Borland compiler.  @code{mysqlshutdown.exe} and
@code{mysqlwatch.exe}
@item David J. Hughes
For the effort to make a shareware SQL database. At TcX, the predecessor
of MySQL AB, we started with @code{mSQL}, but found that it couldn't
satisfy our purposes so instead we wrote an SQL interface to our
application builder Unireg.  @code{mysqladmin} and @code{mysql} client are
programs that were largely influenced by their @code{mSQL} counterparts.
We have put a lot of effort into making the MySQL syntax a superset of
@code{mSQL}. Many of the API's ideas are borrowed from @code{mSQL} to
make it easy to port free @code{mSQL} programs to the MySQL API.
The MySQL software doesn't contain any code from @code{mSQL}.
Two files in the distribution (@file{client/insert_test.c} and
@file{client/select_test.c}) are based on the corresponding (non-copyrighted)
files in the @code{mSQL} distribution, but are modified as examples showing
the changes necessary to convert code from @code{mSQL} to MySQL Server.
(@code{mSQL} is copyrighted David J. Hughes.)

@appendix MySQL Change History

@cindex ChangeLog
@cindex changes, log
@cindex log, changes

This appendix lists the changes from version to version in the MySQL
source code.

We are now working actively on MySQL 4.1 and 5.0, and will provide
only critical bug fixes for MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 3.23.  We update this section
as we add new features, so that everybody can follow the development.

Our TODO section contains what further plans we have for 4.1 & 5.0.
@xref{TODO}.

Note that we tend to update the manual at the same time we make changes to
MySQL.  If you find a version listed here that you can't
find on the MySQL download page (@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/}),
this means that the version has not yet been released!

The date mentioned with a release version is the date of the last BitKeeper
ChangeSet that this particular release has been based on, not the date when
the packages have been made available. The binaries are usually made
available a few days after the date of the tagged ChangeSet - building and
testing all packages takes some time.

@c Please don't add a new version here without also updating Docs/include.texi!

@appendixsec Changes in release 5.0.x (Development)

@cindex changes, version 5.0

The following changelog shows what has already been done in the 5.0 tree:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Basic support for stored procedures (SQL:2003 style).
@xref{Stored Procedures}.
@item
Added @code{SELECT INTO list_of_vars}, which can be of mixed,
that is, global and local type.
@xref{SELECT INTO Statement}.
@item
Removed the update log. It is fully replaced by the binary log.
If the MySQL server is started with @code{--log-update}, it will be
translated to @code{--log-bin} (or ignored if the server is explicitly
started with @code{--log-bin}), and a warning message will be written to
the error log. Setting @code{SQL_LOG_UPDATE} will silently set
@code{SQL_LOG_BIN} instead (or do nothing if the server is explicitly
started with @code{--log-bin}).
@item
User variable names are now case insensitive: If you do @code{SET
@@a=10;} then @code{SELECT @@A;} will now return @code{10}.
Case sensitivity of a variable's value depends on the collation of the value.

@c NOTE: This sentence describes the fix. (Bug #nnnn)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
For replication of @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables: Made the master
automatically write a @code{DELETE FROM} statement to its binary log when a
@code{MEMORY} table is opened for the first time since master's startup.
This is for the case where the slave has replicated a non-empty
@code{MEMORY} table, then the master is shut down and restarted: the table
is now empty on master; the @code{DELETE FROM} empties it on slave too. Note
that even with this fix, between the master's restart and the first use of
the table on master, the slave still has out-of-date data in the table. But
if you use the @code{--init-file} option to populate the @code{MEMORY} table
on the master at startup, it ensures that the failing time interval is zero.
(Bug #2477)
@item
When a session having open temporary tables terminates, the statement
automatically written to the binary log is now @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF
EXISTS} instead of @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE}, for more robustness.
@item
The MySQL server now returns an error if @code{SET SQL_LOG_BIN} is issued by a
user without the @code{SUPER} privilege (in previous versions it just silently
ignored the statement in this case).
@item
Changed that when the MySQL server has binary logging disabled (that is, no
@code{log-bin} option was used) then no transaction binlog cache is allocated
for connections (this should save @code{binlog_cache_size} bytes of memory (32
kilobytes by default) for every connection).
@item
Added option @code{--replicate-same-server-id}.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Strange results with index (x, y) ... WHERE x=val_1 AND y>=val_2 ORDER BY pk; (Bug #3155)
@item
Subquery and order by (Bug #3118)
@item
@code{ALTER DATABASE} caused the client to hang if the database did not
exist. (Bug #2333)
@item
@code{SLAVE START} (which is a deprecated syntax, @code{START SLAVE} should be
used instead) could crash the slave. (Bug #2516)
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were never replicated by the slave if
there were any @code{replicate-*-table} options. (Bug #2527)
@item
The MySQL server did not report any error if the query (submitted through
@code{mysql_real_query()} or @code{mysql_prepare()}) was terminated by garbage
characters (which can happen if you pass a wrong @code{length} parameter to
@code{mysql_real_query()} or @code{mysql_prepare()}); the result was that the
garbage characters were written into the binary log. (Bug #2703)
@item
Replication:
If a client connects to a slave server and issues an administrative
statement for a table (for example, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{REPAIR
TABLE}), this could sometimes stop the slave SQL thread. This does not lead
to any corruption, but you must use @code{START SLAVE} to get replication
going again. (Bug #1858)
@item
Made clearer the error message which one gets when an update is refused because
of the @code{read-only} option. (Bug #2757)
@item
Fixed that @code{replicate-wild-*-table} rules apply to @code{ALTER DATABASE}
when the table pattern is '%', like it is already the case for @code{CREATE
DATABASE} and @code{DROP DATABASE}. (Bug #3000)
@item
Fixed that when a @code{Rotate} event is found by the slave SQL thread in the
middle of a transaction, the value of @code{Relay_Log_Pos} in @code{SHOW SLAVE
STATUS} remains correct. (Bug #3017)
@item
Corrected the master's binary log position that @code{InnoDB} reports when it is doing a
crash recovery on a slave server. (Bug #3015)
@item
Changed the column @code{Seconds_Behind_Master} in @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} to
never show a value of -1. (Bug #2826)
@item
Changed that when a @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE} statement is automatically
written to the binlog when a session ends, the statement is recorded with an
error code of value zero (this ensures that killing a @code{SELECT} on the
master does not result in a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3063)
@item
Changed that when a thread handling @code{INSERT DELAYED} (also known as a
@code{delayed_insert} thread) is killed, its statements are recorded with an
error code of value zero (killing such a thread does not endanger
replication, so we thus avoid a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3081)
@item
Fixed deadlock when two @code{START SLAVE} commands were run at the same
time. (Bug #2921)
@item
Fixed that a statement never triggers a superfluous error on the slave, if it
must be excluded given the @code{replicate-*} options. The bug was that if the
statement had been killed on the master, the slave would stop. (Bug #2983)
@item
The @code{--local-load} option of @code{mysqlbinlog} now requires an argument.
@item
Fixed a segmentation fault when running @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} after
@code{RESET SLAVE}. (Bug #2922)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server} read all binary logs following the
one that was requested.  It now stops at the end of the requested file, the
same was it does when reading a local binary log. (Bug #3204)
@item
Fixed @code{mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server} to print the exact
positions of events in the "at #" lines. (Bug #3214)
@item
Fixed a rare error condition that caused the slave SQL thread spuriously
to print the message @code{Binlog has bad magic number} and stop when it
was not necessary to do so.  (Bug #3401)
@item
Fixed @code{mysqlbinlog} not to forget to print a @code{USE} statement
under rare circumstances where the binary log contained a @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} statement. (Bug #3415)
@item
Fixed a memory corruption when replicating a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} when the
master had version 3.23. (Bug #3422)
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were always replicated by the slave if
there were some @code{replicate-*-ignore-table} options and no
@code{replicate-*-do-table} options. (Bug #3461)
@item
Fixed a crash of the MySQL slave server when it was built with
@code{--with-debug} and replicating itself. (BUG #3568)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 5.0.0 (22 Dec 2003: Alpha)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{KILL} statement now takes @code{CONNECTION} and @code{QUERY}
variants. The first is the same as @code{KILL} with no modifier (it
kills a given connection thread).  The second kills only the statement
currently being executed by the connection.
@item
Added @code{TIMESTAMPADD()} and @code{TIMESTAMPDIFF()} functions.
@item
Added @code{WEEK} and @code{QUARTER} values as @code{INTERVAL} arguments
for @code{DATE_ADD()} and @code{DATE_SUB()} functions.
@item
New binary log format that enables replication of those session variables:
@code{sql_mode}, @code{SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL}, @code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS}
(that one was already replicated since 4.0.14 but here it's done more
efficiently: takes less space in the binary logs), @code{UNIQUE_CHECKS}.
Other variables (like character sets, @code{SQL_SELECT_LIMIT}...) will be
replicated in next 5.0.x releases.
@item
Implemented @code{Index Merge} optimization for @code{OR} clauses.
@xref{OR optimizations}.
@item
Basic support for stored procedures (SQL:2003 style).
@xref{Stored Procedures}.
@item
Added @code{SELECT INTO list_of_vars}, which can be of mixed,
that is, global and local type.
@xref{SELECT INTO Statement}.
@item
Easier replication upgrade (5.0.0 masters can read older binary logs,
5.0.0 slaves can read older relay logs; see
@ref{Replication Compatibility} for more details). The format of the binary log and
relay log is changed compared to the one of MySQL 4.1 and older.
@item
@strong{Important note:}
If you upgrade to InnoDB-4.1.1 or higher, you cannot downgrade to a version
lower than 4.1.1 any more! That is because earlier versions of @code{InnoDB} are
not aware of multiple tablespaces.

@code{INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...} syntax.  This allows you to
@code{UPDATE} an existing row if the insert would cause a duplicate value
in a @code{PRIMARY} or @code{UNIQUE} key. (@code{REPLACE} allows you to
overwrite an existing row, which is something entirely different.)
@xref{INSERT}.
@item
A newly designed @code{GROUP_CONCAT()} aggregate function.
@xref{Group by functions and modifiers}.
@item
Extensive Unicode (UTF8) support.
@item

@c NOTE: This sentence describes the fix. (Bug #nnnn)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
New @code{myisam_data_pointer_size} system variable.
@xref{Server system variables, @code{myisam_data_pointer_size}}.
@item
The @code{--log-warnings} server option now is enabled by default.
Disable with @code{--skip-log-warnings}.
@item
The @code{--defaults-file=file_name} option now requires that the filename
must exist (safety fix). (Bug #3413)
@item
@file{mysqld_multi} now creates the log in datadir (from @code{[mysqld]}
section in @file{my.cnf} or compiled in), not in @file{/tmp} -
vulnerability id CAN-2004-0388. Thanks to Christian Hammers from
Debian Security Team for reporting this!
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
String comparison now works according to the SQL standard.  Because we have
that @code{'a' = 'a '} then from it must follow that @code{'a' > 'a\t'}.
(The latter was not the case before 4.1.2.) To implement it, we had to
change how storage engines compare strings internally.  As a side effect, if
you have a table where a @code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR} column in some row
has a value with the last character less than @code{ASCII(32)} you will have
to repair this table. @code{CHECK TABLES} will tell you if this problem
exists. (Bug #3152)
@item
Added support for @code{DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP} and for @code{ON UPDATE
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP} specifications for @code{TIMESTAMP} columns. Now you can
explicitly say that a @code{TIMESTAMP} column should be set automatically
to the current timestamp for @code{INSERT} and/or @code{UPDATE} statements, or
even prevent the column from updating automatically. Only one column with such
an auto-set 
feature per table is supported. @code{TIMESTAMP} columns created with earlier 
versions of MySQL behave as before. Behavior of @code{TIMESTAMP} columns that 
were created without explicit specification of default/on as earlier
depends on its position in table: If it is the first @code{TIMESTAMP} column, it will
be treated as having been specified as @code{TIMESTAMP DEFAULT
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}.
In other cases, it would be treated as a @code{TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 0} column.
@code{NOW} is supported as an alias for @code{CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}.
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!} Unlike in previous versions, explicit
specification of default values for @code{TIMESTAMP} column is never ignored
and turns off the auto-set feature (unless you have @code{CURRENT_TIMESTAMP} as
the default).
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
Renamed prepared statements C API functions:
@multitable @columnfractions .30 .70
@item @strong{Old Name}           @tab @strong{New Name}
@item @code{mysql_bind_param()}     @tab @code{mysql_stmt_bind_param()}
@item @code{mysql_bind_result()}    @tab @code{mysql_stmt_bind_result()}
@item @code{mysql_prepare()}        @tab @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()}
@item @code{mysql_execute()}        @tab @code{mysql_stmt_execute()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch()}          @tab @code{mysql_stmt_fetch()}
@item @code{mysql_fetch_column()}   @tab @code{mysql_stmt_fetch_column()}
@item @code{mysql_param_count()}    @tab @code{mysql_stmt_param_count()}

@item @code{mysql_get_metadata()} @tab @code{mysql_stmt_result_metadata()}
@item @code{mysql_send_long_data()} @tab @code{mysql_stmt_send_long_data()}
@end multitable

Now all functions that operate with a @code{MYSQL_STMT} structure begin with
the prefix @code{mysql_stmt_}.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
The signature of the @code{mysql_stmt_prepare()} function was changed to
@code{int mysql_stmt_prepare(MYSQL_STMT *stmt, const char *query,
unsigned long length)}.
To create a @code{MYSQL_STMT} handle, you 
should use the @code{mysql_stmt_init()} function.
@item
@code{SHOW GRANTS} with no @code{FOR} clause or with @code{FOR
CURRENT_USER()} shows the privileges for the current session.
@item
The improved character set support introduced in MySQL 4.1.0 for the
@code{MyISAM} and @code{HEAP} storage engines is now available for
@code{InnoDB} as well.
@item
A key name of ``Primary'' is no longer allowed. (Bug #856)
@item
MySQL now issues a warning when a @code{SET} or @code{ENUM} column with
duplicate values in the list is created. (Bug #1427)
@item
Now @code{SQL_SELECT_LIMIT} variable has no influence on subqueries.
(Bug #2600)
@item
@code{UNHEX()} function implemented.
@xref{String functions, , @code{UNHEX(str)}}.
@item
History in command line client does not store multiple copies of identical queries that are run consecutively.
@item
Multi-line queries in the command line client now are stored as a single line. 
@item
@code{UUID()} function implemented. Note that it does not work with replication
yet.
@xref{Miscellaneous functions, , @code{UUID()}}.
@item
Prepared statements with all types of subqueries fixed.
@item
MySQL now supports up to 64 keys per table.
@item
@code{MyISAM} tables now support keys up to 1000 bytes long.
@item
@code{MyISAM} and @code{InnoDB} tables now support index prefix lengths up
to 1000 bytes long.
@item
If you try to create a key with a key part that is too long, and it is safe
to auto-truncate it to a smaller length, MySQL now does so.  A warning is
generated, rather than an error.
@item
The @code{ft_boolean_syntax} variable now can be changed while the server is
running.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item
@code{REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT FROM user_list}
is changed to a more consistent
@code{REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM user_list}. (Bug #2642)
@item
Internal string-to-number conversion now supports only SQL:2003 compatible
syntax for numbers. In particular, @code{'0x10'+0} will not work anymore.
(Actually, it worked only on some systems before, such as Linux. It
did not work on others, such as FreeBSD or Solaris. Making these queries
OS-independent was the goal of this change). Use @code{CONV()} to convert
hexadecimal numbers to decimal. E.g. @code{CONV(MID('0x10',3),16,10)+0}.
@item
@code{mysqlhotcopy} now works on NetWare.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE DROP PRIMARY KEY} no longer drops the first @code{UNIQUE}
index if there is no primary index. (Bug #2361)
@item
Added @code{latin1_spanish_ci} (Modern Spanish) collation for the @code{latin1}
character set.
@item
Added the @code{ENGINE} table option as a synonym for the @code{TYPE} option
for @code{CREATE TABLE} and @code{ALTER TABLE}.
@item
Added the @code{--default-storage-engine} server option as a synonym for
@code{--default-table-type}.
@item
Added the @code{storage_engine} system variable as a synonym for
@code{table_type}.
@item
Added @code{init_connect} and @code{init_slave} server variables.
The values should be SQL statements to be executed when each client
connects or each time a slave's SQL thread starts, respectively.
@item
C API enhancement:
@code{SERVER_QUERY_NO_INDEX_USED} and
@code{SERVER_QUERY_NO_GOOD_INDEX_USED} flags are now set
in the @code{server_status} field of the @code{MYSQL} structure.
It is these flags that make the query to be logged as slow 
if @code{mysqld} was started with @code{--log-slow-queries
--log-queries-not-using-indexes}.
@item
For replication of @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables: Made the master
automatically write a @code{DELETE FROM} statement to its binary log when a
@code{MEMORY} table is opened for the first time since master's startup.
This is for the case where the slave has replicated a non-empty
@code{MEMORY} table, then the master is shut down and restarted: the table
is now empty on master; the @code{DELETE FROM} empties it on slave too. Note
that even with this fix, between the master's restart and the first use of
the table on master, the slave still has out-of-date data in the table. But
if you use the @code{init-file} option to populate the @code{MEMORY} table
on the master at startup, it ensures that the failing time interval is zero.
(Bug #2477)
@item
When a session having open temporary tables terminates, the statement
automatically written to the binary log is now @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF
EXISTS} instead of @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE}, for more robustness.
@item
The MySQL server now returns an error if @code{SET SQL_LOG_BIN} or @code{SET
SQL_LOG_UPDATE} is issued by a user without the @code{SUPER} privilege (in
previous versions it just silently ignored the statement in this case).
@item
Changed that when the MySQL server has binary logging disabled (that is, no
@code{log-bin} option was used) then no transaction binlog cache is allocated
for connections (this should save @code{binlog_cache_size} bytes of memory (32
kilobytes by default) for every connection).
@item
Added @code{Binlog_cache_use} and @code{Binlog_cache_disk_use} status
variables that count the number of transactions that used transaction binary
log and that had to flush this temporary binary log to disk instead of using
only buffer in memory. They can be used for tuning the
@code{binlog_cache_size} system variable.
@item
Added option @code{--replicate-same-server-id}.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
One can now call @code{mysql_stmt_attr_set(..., STMT_ATTR_UPDATE_MAX_LENGTH)}
to tell the client library to update @code{MYSQL_FIELD->max_length} when
doing @code{mysql_stmt_store_result()}. (Bug #1647).
@item
Added support for unsigned integer types to prepared statement API
(Bug #3035).
@item
Fixed crash in prepared statements when subquery in the @code{FROM}
clause with parameter used. (Bug #3020)
@item
Fixed unknown error when negative value bind to unsigned. (Bug #3223)
@item
Fixed aggregate function in prepared statements. (Bug #3360)
@item
Incorrect error message when wrong table used in @code{multi-delete}
statement in prepared statements. (Bug #3411)
@item
Requiring @code{UPDATE} privilege for tables which will not be updated in
@code{multi-update} query in prepared statements.
@item
Fixed prepared statement support for @code{INSERT}, @code{REPLACE},
@code{CREATE}, @code{DELETE}, @code{SELECT}, @code{DO}, @code{SET} and
@code{SHOW}. All other commands are prohibited via prepared statement
interface. (Bug ##3398, Bug #3406, Bug #2811)
@item
Fixed a lot of bugs in @code{GROUP_CONCAT()}. (Bug #2695, Bug #3381, Bug #3319)
@item
Added optimization that allows for prepared statements using a large number of 
tables or tables with a large number of columns to be re-executed significantly 
faster. (Bug #2050)
@item
Fixed bug that caused execution of prepared statements to fail then table
that this statement were using left table cache. This bug showed up as if
this prepared statement used random garbage as column names or as server
crashes. (Bug #3307)
@item
Fixed a problem resulting from setting the @code{character_set_results}
variable to @code{NULL}.
(Bug #3296)
@item
Fixed query cache statistics.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ANALYZE TABLE} on a @code{BDB} table inside a transaction
that hangs server thread. (Bug #2342)
@item
Fixed a symlink vulnerability in @file{mysqlbug} script. (Bug #3284)
@item
Fixed a bug in parallel repair
(@code{myisamchk -p}, @code{myisam_repair_threads});
sometimes the repair process failed to repair a table. (Bug #1334)
@item
A query that uses both @code{UNION [DISTINCT]} and @code{UNION ALL}
now works correctly. (Bug #1428)
@item
Table default character set affects @code{LONGBLOB} columns. (Bug #2821)
@item
@code{CONCAT_WS()} makes the server die in case of illegal mix of collations. (Bug #3087)
@item
UTF8 charset breaks joins with mixed column/string constant. (Bug #2959)
@item 
Fixed @code{DROP DATABASE} to report number of tables deleted.
@item 
Fixed memory leak in the client library when statement handle was freed 
on closed connection (call to @code{mysql_stmt_close} after
@code{mysql_close}). (Bug #3073)
@item
Fixed server segfaults when processing malformed prepared statements
commands. (Bug #2795, Bug #2274)
@item
Fixed using subqueries with @code{OR} and @code{AND} functions. (Bug #2838)
@item
Fixed comparison of tables/database names with 
@code{--lower_case_table_names} option. (Bug #2880)
@item
Removed try to check @code{NULL} if index built on column where @code{NULL}
is impossible in @code{IN} subquery optimization. (Bug #2393)
@item
Fixed incorrect parsing of subqueries in the @code{FROM} clause. (Bug #2421)
@item
Fixed processing of @code{RAND()} in subqueries with static tables. (bug #2645)
@item
Fixed bug with quoting of table names in @code{mysqldump} for 
various values of @code{sql_mode} of server. (Bug #2591)
@item
Fixed bug with storing values that are out of range for @code{DOUBLE} and
@code{FLOAT} columns.
(Bug #2082)
@item
Fixed bug with compiling @code{--with-pstack} with binutils 2.13.90. (Bug #1661)
@item
Fixed a bug in the @code{GRANT} system. When a password was assigned to an
account at the global level and then privileges were granted at the database
level (without specifying any password), the existing password was replaced
temporarily in memory until the next @code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} operation or
the server was restarted. (Bug #2953)
@item
Fixed a bug in full-text search on multi-byte character set (such as UTF8)
that appeared when a search word was shorter than a matching word from
the index (for example, searching for ``Uppsala'' when table data contain
``Upps@ringaccent{a}la''). (Bug #3011)
@item
Fixed a bug that made @code{Max_used_connections} to be less than
the actual maximum number of connections in use simultaneously.
@item
Fixed calculation of @code{Index_length} in @code{HEAP} table status for
@code{BTREE} indexes. (Bug #2719)
@item
Fixed @code{mysql_stmt_affected_rows()} call to always return number of rows 
affected by given statement. (Bug #2247)
@item
Fixed crash in @code{MATCH ... AGAINST()} on a phrase search operator with
a missing closing double quote. (Bug #2708)
@item
Fixed output of @code{mysqldump --tab}. (Bug #2705)
@item
Fix for a bug in @code{UNION} operations that prevented proper handling of
@code{NULL} columns. This happened only if a column in the first
@code{SELECT} node was @code{NOT NULL}. (Bug #2508)
@item
Fix for a bug in @code{UNION} operations with @code{InnoDB} storage engine,
when some columns from one table where used in one @code{SELECT} statement and
some were used in another @code{SELECT} statement. (Bug #2552)
@item 
Fixed a few years old bug in the range optimizer that
caused a segmentation fault on some very rare queries. (Bug #2698)
@item
Fixed bug with @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE ...} which didn't properly double 
quotes. (Bug #2593)
@item
Queries with subqueries in @code{FROM} clause locks all tables at once for now.
This also fixed bugs in @code{EXPLAIN} of subqueries
in @code{FROM} output. (Bug #2120)
@item
Fixed bug with @code{mysqldump} not quoting ``tricky'' names correctly.
(Bug #2592)
@item 
Fix for a bug that prevented table / column privileges from
being loaded on startup. (Bug #2546)
@item
Fixed bug in replication with @code{CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ...} that resulted
in a statement not being written to the binary log. (Bug #2557)
@item
Fixed memory leak in @code{INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...}. 
(Bug #2438)
@item
Fixed bug in the parser, making the syntax @code{CONVERT(expression,type)}
legal again.
@item
Fixed parsing of short-form IP addresses in @code{INET_ATON()}. (Bug #2310)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{CREATE ... SELECT} that sometimes caused a
string column with a multi-byte character set (such as @code{utf8}) to have
insufficient length to hold the data.
@item
Fixed a rare table corruption on adding data (@code{INSERT}, @code{REPLACE},
@code{UPDATE}, etc. but not @code{DELETE}) to a @code{FULLTEXT} index.
(Bug #2417)
@item
Compile the @code{MySQL-client} RPM package against @code{libreadline} instead
of @code{libedit}. (Bug #2289)
@item
Fix for a crashing bug that was caused by not setting
@code{vio_timeout()} virtual function for all protocols. This bug occurred on
Windows. (Bug #2025)
@item
Fix for a bug that caused @code{mysql} client program to erroneously
cache the value of the current database. (Bug #2025)
@item
Fix for a bug that caused client/server communication to be
broken when @code{mysql_set_server_option()} or
@code{mysql_get_server_option()} were invoked.
(Bug #2207)
@item
Fix for a bug that caused wong results when @code{CAST()} was
applied on @code{NULL} to signed or unsigned integer column.
(Bug #2219)
@item
Fix for a crashing bug that occurred in the @code{mysql} client program when
database name was longer then expected.
(Bug #2221)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{CHECK TABLE} that sometimes
resulted in a spurious error @code{Found key at page ... that points to record
outside datafile} for a table with a @code{FULLTEXT} index. (Bug #2190)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{GRANT} with table-level privilege handling. (Bug #2178)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ORDER BY} on a small column. (Bug #2147)
@item
Fixed a bug with the @code{INTERVAL()} function when 8 or more 
comparison arguments are provided. (Bug #1561)
@item
Packaging:
Fixed a bug in the Mac OS PKG @code{postinstall} script
(@code{mysql_install_db} was called with an obsolete argument).
@item
Packaging:
Added missing file @file{mysql_create_system_tables} to the server RPM
package. This bug was fixed for the 4.1.1 RPMs by updating the MySQL-server
RPM from @code{MySQL-server-4.1.1-0} to @code{MySQL-server-4.1.1-1}. The
other RPMs were not affected by this change.
@item
Fixed a bug in @file{myisamchk} and @code{CHECK TABLE} that sometimes
resulted in a spurious error @code{Found key at page ... that points to record
outside datafile} for a table with a @code{FULLTEXT} index. (Bug #1977)
@item
Fixed a hang in full-text indexing of strings in multi-byte (all besides
@code{utf8}) charsets. (Bug #2065)
@item
Fixed a crash in full-text indexing of UTF8 data. (Bug #2033)
@item
Replication:
a rare race condition in the slave SQL thread that could lead to an
incorrect complaint that the relay log is corrupted. (Bug #2011)
@item
Replication:
If a client connects to a slave server and issues an administrative
statement for a table (for example, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{REPAIR
TABLE}), this could sometimes stop the slave SQL thread. This does not lead
to any corruption, but you must use @code{START SLAVE} to get replication
going again. (Bug #1858)
@item
Replication:
in the slave SQL thread, a multiple-table @code{UPDATE} could produce an
incorrect complaint that some record was not found in one table, if the
@code{UPDATE} was preceded by a @code{INSERT ... SELECT}. (Bug #1701)
@item
Replication: sometimes the master gets a non-fatal error during the execution
of a statement but finally the statements succeeds (for example, a write to a
@code{MyISAM} table first receives "no space left on device" but is able to finally
complete, @pxref{Full disk}); the bug was that the master forgot to reset the
error code to 0 after success, so the error code got into its binary log, thus
making the slave giving false alarms like "did not get the same error as on
master". (Bug #2083)
@item
Removed a misleading "check permissions on master.info" from a replication
error message, because the cause of the problem could be different from
permissions. (Bug #2121)
@item
Fixed a crash when the replication slave was unable to create the first relay
log. (Bug #2145)
@item
@code{ALTER DATABASE} caused the client to hang if the database did not
exist. (Bug #2333)
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were never replicated by the slave if
there were any @code{replicate-*-table} options. (Bug #2527)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME}, when rename to the table with
the same name in another database silently dropped destination table if
it existed. (Bug #2628)
@item
The MySQL server did not report any error if the query (submitted through
@code{mysql_real_query()} or @code{mysql_prepare()}) was terminated by garbage
characters (which can happen if you pass a wrong @code{length} parameter to
@code{mysql_real_query()} or @code{mysql_prepare()}); the result was that the
garbage characters were written into the binary log. (Bug #2703)
@item
Fixed bug in client library which caused @code{mysql_fetch} and 
@code{mysql_stmt_store_result()} to hang if they were called without
prior call of @code{mysql_execute()}. Now they give an error instead. 
(Bug #2248)
@item
Made clearer the error message which one gets when an update is refused because
of the @code{read-only} option. (Bug #2757)
@item
Fixed that @code{replicate-wild-*-table} rules apply to @code{ALTER DATABASE}
when the table pattern is '%', like it is already the case for @code{CREATE
DATABASE} and @code{DROP DATABASE}. (Bug #3000)
@item
Fixed that when a @code{Rotate} event is found by the slave SQL thread in the
middle of a transaction, the value of @code{Relay_Log_Pos} in @code{SHOW SLAVE
STATUS} remains correct. (Bug #3017)
@item
Corrected the master's binary log position that @code{InnoDB} reports when it is doing a
crash recovery on a slave server. (Bug #3015)
@item
Changed the column @code{Seconds_Behind_Master} in @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} to
never show a value of -1. (Bug #2826)
@item
Changed that when a @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE} statement is automatically
written to the binary log when a session ends, the statement is recorded with an
error code of value zero (this ensures that killing a @code{SELECT} on the
master does not result in a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3063)
@item
Changed that when a thread handling @code{INSERT DELAYED} (also known as a
@code{delayed_insert} thread) is killed, its statements are recorded with an
error code of value zero (killing such a thread does not endanger
replication, so we thus avoid a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3081)
@item
Fixed deadlock when two @code{START SLAVE} commands were run at the same
time. (Bug #2921)
@item
Fixed that a statement never triggers a superfluous error on the slave, if it
must be excluded given the @code{replicate-*} options. The bug was that if the
statement had been killed on the master, the slave would stop. (Bug #2983)
@item
The @code{--local-load} option of @code{mysqlbinlog} now requires an argument.
@item
Fixed a segmentation fault when running @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} after
@code{RESET SLAVE}. (Bug #2922)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server} read all binary logs following the
one that was requested.  It now stops at the end of the requested file, the
same was it does when reading a local binary log. (Bug #3204)
@item
Fixed @code{mysqlbinlog --read-from-remote-server} to print the exact
positions of events in the "at #" lines. (Bug #3214)
@item
Fixed a rare error condition that caused the slave SQL thread spuriously
to print the message @code{Binlog has bad magic number} and stop when it
was not necessary to do so.  (Bug #3401)
@item
Fixed the @code{Exec_master_log_pos} column and its disk image in the
@file{relay-log.info} file to be correct if the master had version 3.23. (The
value was too big by six bytes.) This bug does not exist in MySQL 5.0.
(Bug #3400)
@item
Fixed @code{mysqlbinlog} not to forget to print a @code{USE} statement
under rare circumstances where the binary log contained a @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} statement. (Bug #3415)
@item
Fixed a memory corruption when replicating a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} when the
master had version 3.23. Some smaller problems remain in this setup,
@xref{Replication Features}. (Bug #3422)
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were always replicated by the slave if
there were some @code{replicate-*-ignore-table} options and no
@code{replicate-*-do-table} options. (Bug #3461)
@item
Fixed a crash of the MySQL slave server when it was built with
@code{--with-debug} and replicating itself. (BUG #3568)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.1.1 (01 Dec 2003)

This release includes all fixes in MySQL 4.0.16 and most of the fixes
in MySQL 4.0.17.

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
New @code{CHECKSUM TABLE} statement for reporting table checksum values.
@item
Added @code{character_set_client}, @code{character_set_connection},
@code{character_set_database}, @code{character_set_results},
@code{character_set_server}, @code{character_set_system},
@code{collation_connection}, @code{collation_database}, and
@code{collation_server} system variables to provide information about
character sets and collations.
@item
It is now possible to create multiple key caches, assign table indexes to
particular caches, and to preload indexes into caches.
@xref{CACHE INDEX,  , @code{CACHE INDEX}}.
@xref{LOAD INDEX,  , @code{LOAD INDEX}}.
Structured system
variables are introduced as a means of grouping related key cache parameters.
@xref{Structured System Variables}.
@item
New @code{COERCIBILITY()} function to return the collation coercibility of a
string.
@item
The @code{--quote-names} option for @code{mysqldump} now is enabled
by default.
@item
@code{mysqldump} now includes a statement in the dump output to set
@code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} to 0 to avoid problems with tables having to be
reloaded in a particular order when the dump is reloaded. The existing
@code{FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS} value is saved and restored.
@item
@strong{Important note:} If you upgrade to @code{InnoDB}-4.1.1 or higher,
you cannot downgrade to a version lower than 4.1.1
any more! That is because earlier versions of @code{InnoDB} are not aware of
multiple tablespaces.
@item
One can revoke all privileges from a user with
@code{REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT FROM user_list}.
@item
Added @code{IGNORE} option for @code{DELETE} statement.
@item
The MySQL source distribution now also includes the MySQL Internals
Manual @file{internals.texi}.
@item
Added @code{mysql_set_server_option()} C API client function to allow multiple
statement handling in the server to be enabled or disabled.
@item
The @code{mysql_next_result()} C API function now returns @code{-1} if there
are no more result sets.
@item
Renamed @code{CLIENT_MULTI_QUERIES} connect option flag to
@code{CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS}. To allow for a transition period, the old
option will continue to be recognized for a while.
@item
Require @code{DEFAULT} before table and database default character set.
This enables us to use @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name ... CHARACTER SET=...}
to change the character set for all @code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, and
@code{TEXT} columns in a table.
@item
Added @code{MATCH ... AGAINST( ... WITH QUERY EXPANSION)} and the
@code{ft_query_expansion_limit} server variable.
@item
Removed unused @code{ft_max_word_len_for_sort} system variable.
@item
Removed unused @code{ft_max_word_len_for_sort} variable from @code{myisamchk}.
@item
Full-text search now supports multi-byte character sets and the Unicode
@code{utf8} character set. (The Unicode @code{ucs2} character set is not
yet supported.)
@item
Phrase search in @code{MATCH ... AGAINST ( ... IN BOOLEAN MODE)} no longer
matches partial words.
@item
Added aggregate function @code{BIT_XOR()} for bitwise XOR operations.
@item
Replication over SSL now works.
@item
The @code{START SLAVE} statement now supports an @code{UNTIL} clause for
specifying that the slave SQL thread should be started but run only until it
reaches a given position in the master's binary logs or in the slave's relay logs.
@item
Produce warnings even for single-row @code{INSERT} statements, not just for
multiple-row @code{INSERT} statements. Previously, it was necessary to set
@code{SQL_WARNINGS=1} to generate warnings for single-row statements.
@item
Added @code{delimiter} (@code{\d}) command to the @code{mysql} command-line
client for changing the statement delimiter (terminator).
The default delimiter is semicolon.
@item
@code{CHAR}, @code{VARCHAR}, and @code{TEXT} columns now have lengths measured
in characters rather than in bytes.
The character size depends on the column's character set.
This means, for example, that a @code{CHAR(n)} column
for a multi-byte character set will take more storage than before.
Similarly, index values on such columns are measured in characters, not bytes.
@item
@code{LIMIT} no longer accepts negative arguments
(they used to be treated as very big positive numbers before).
@item
The @code{DATABASE()} function now returns @code{NULL} rather than the empty
string if there is no database selected.
@item
Added @code{--sql-mode=NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO} option to suppress the usual
behavior of generating the next sequence number when zero is stored in
an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column. With this mode enabled, zero is stored as
zero; only storing @code{NULL} generates a sequence number.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
Client authentication now is based on 41-byte passwords in the
@code{user} table, not 45-byte passwords as in 4.1.0.
Any 45-byte passwords created for 4.1.0 must be reset after running the
@code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script.
@item
Added @code{secure_auth} global server system variable and @code{--secure-auth}
server option that disallow authentication for accounts that have old
(pre-4.1.1) passwords.
@item
Added @code{--secure-auth} option to @code{mysql} command-line client. If this
option is set, the client refuses to send passwords in old (pre-4.1.1) format.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
Renamed the C API @code{mysql_prepare_result()} function to
@code{mysql_get_metadata()} as the old name was confusing.
@item
Added @code{DROP USER 'username'@@'hostname'} statement to drop an account
that has no privileges.
@item
The interface to aggregated UDF functions has changed a bit. You must now
declare a @code{xxx_clear()} function for each aggregate function @code{XXX()}.
@item
Added new @code{ADDTIME()}, @code{DATE()}, @code{DATEDIFF()}, @code{LAST_DAY()},
@code{MAKEDATE()}, @code{MAKETIME()}, @code{MICROSECOND()}, @code{SUBTIME()},
@code{TIME()}, @code{TIMEDIFF()}, @code{TIMESTAMP()}, @code{UTC_DATE()},
@code{UTC_TIME()}, @code{UTC_TIMESTAMP()}, and @code{WEEKOFYEAR()}
functions.
@item
Added new syntax for @code{ADDDATE()} and @code{SUBDATE()}.
The second argument now may be a number representing the number of days to
be added to or subtracted from the first date argument.
@item
Added new @code{type} values @code{DAY_MICROSECOND},
@code{HOUR_MICROSECOND}, @code{MINUTE_MICROSECOND},
@code{SECOND_MICROSECOND}, and @code{MICROSECOND}
for @code{DATE_ADD()}, @code{DATE_SUB()}, and @code{EXTRACT()}.
@item
Added new @code{%f} microseconds format specifier for @code{DATE_FORMAT()} and
@code{TIME_FORMAT()}.
@item
All queries in which at least one @code{SELECT} does not use indexes properly
now are written to the slow query log when long log format is used.  
@item
It is now possible to create a @code{MERGE} table from @code{MyISAM} tables in
different databases. Formerly, all the @code{MyISAM} tables had to be in the
same database, and the @code{MERGE} table had to be created in that database
as well.
@item
Added new @code{COMPRESS()}, @code{UNCOMPRESS()}, and
@code{UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH()} functions.
@item
When using @code{SET sql_mode='mode'} for a complex mode (like @code{ANSI}), we
now update the @code{sql_mode} variable to include all the individual options
implied by the complex mode.
@item
Added the OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) function @code{ROLLUP}, which
provides summary rows for each @code{GROUP BY} level.
@item
Added @code{SQLSTATE} codes for all server errors.
@item
Added @code{mysql_sqlstate()} and @code{mysql_stmt_sqlstate()} C API client
functions that return the @code{SQLSTATE} error code for the last error.
@item
@code{TIME} columns with hour values greater than 24 were returned incorrectly
to the client.
@item
@code{ANALYZE}, @code{OPTIMIZE}, @code{REPAIR}, and @code{FLUSH} statements
are now stored in the binary log and thus replicated to slaves.
This logging does not occur if the optional @code{NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG} keyword 
(or its alias @code{LOCAL}) is given.  Exceptions are that
@code{FLUSH LOGS}, @code{FLUSH MASTER}, @code{FLUSH SLAVE}, and
@code{FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK} are not logged in any case.
For a syntax example, see @ref{FLUSH, , @code{FLUSH}}.
@item
New global system variable @code{relay_log_purge} to enable or disable automatic
relay log purging.
@item
@code{LOAD DATA} now produces warnings that can be fetched with
@code{SHOW WARNINGS}.
@item
Added support for syntax @code{CREATE TABLE table2 (LIKE table1)}
that creates an empty table @code{table2} with a definition that is
exactly the same as @code{table1}, including any indexes.
@item
@code{CREATE TABLE tbl_name (...) TYPE=storage_engine} now generates a
warning if the named storage engine is not available. The table is still
created as a @code{MyISAM} table, as before.
@item
Most subqueries are now much faster than before.
@item
Added @code{PURGE BINARY LOGS} as an alias for @code{PURGE MASTER LOGS}.
@item
Disabled the @code{PURGE LOGS} statement that was added in in version 4.1.0.
The statement now should be issued as @code{PURGE MASTER LOGS} or
@code{PURGE BINARY LOGS}.
@item
Added @code{SHOW BDB LOGS} as an alias for @code{SHOW LOGS}.
@item
Added @code{SHOW MASTER LOGS} (which had been deleted in version
4.1.0) as an alias for @code{SHOW BINARY LOGS}.
@item
Added @code{Slave_IO_State} and @code{Seconds_Behind_Master} columns
to the output of @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}.
@code{Slave_IO_State} indicates the state of the slave I/O thread, and
@code{Seconds_Behind_Master} indicates the number of seconds by
which the slave is late compared to the master.
@item
The @code{--lower-case-table-names=1} server option now also makes aliases case
insensitive. (Bug #534)
@item
Changed that the relay log is flushed to disk by the slave I/O thread every
time it reads a relay log event. This reduces the risk of losing some part of
the relay log in case of brutal crash.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed @code{mysql} parser not to erroneously interpret @samp{;} character
within @code{/* ... */} comment as statement terminator.
@item
Fixed merging types and length of result set columns for @code{UNION}
operations. The types and lengths now are determined taking into
account values for all @code{SELECT} statements in the @code{UNION},
not just the first @code{SELECT}.
@item
Fixed a bug in privilege handling that caused connections from
certain IP addresses to be assigned incorrect database-level privileges.
A connection could be assigned the database privileges of the
previous successful authentication from one of those IP addresses,
even if the IP address username and database name were different. (Bug #1636)
@item
Error-handling functions were not called properly when an error resulted
from @code{[CREATE | REPLACE| INSERT] ... SELECT} statements.
@item
@code{HASH}, @code{BTREE}, @code{RTREE}, @code{ERRORS}, and
@code{WARNINGS} no longer are reserved words. (Bug #724)
@item
Fix for bug in @code{ROLLUP} when all tables were @code{const} tables.
(Bug #714)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{UNION} that prohibited @code{NULL} values from being
inserted into result set columns where the first @code{SELECT} of the
@code{UNION} retrieved @code{NOT NULL} columns. The type and max_length
of the result column is now defined based on all @code{UNION} parts.
@item
Fixed name resolution of columns of reduced subqueries in unions. (Bug #745)
@item
Fixed memory overrun in subqueries in select list with @code{WHERE} clause
bigger than outer query @code{WHERE} clause. (Bug #726)
@item
Fixed a bug that caused @code{MyISAM} tables with @code{FULLTEXT} indexes
created in 4.0.x to be unreadable in 4.1.x.
@item
Fixed a data loss bug in @code{REPAIR TABLE ... USE_FRM} when used
with tables
that contained @code{TIMESTAMP} columns and were created in 4.0.x.
@item
Fixed reduced subquery processing in @code{ORDER BY}/@code{GROUP BY}
clauses. (Bug #442)
@item
Fixed name resolution of outer columns of subquery in
@code{INSERT}/@code{REPLACE} statements. (Bug #446)
@item
Fixed bug in marking columns of reduced subqueries. (Bug #679)
@item
Fixed a bug that made @code{CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX} syntax illegal.
@item
Fixed a crash when a @code{SELECT} that required a temporary table
(marked by @code{Using temporary} in @code{EXPLAIN} output)
was used as a derived table in @code{EXPLAIN} command. (Bug #251)
@item
Fixed a rare table corruption bug in @code{DELETE}
from a big table with
a @strong{new} (created by MySQL-4.1) full-text index.
@item
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} now returns 0 if the last @code{INSERT} statement
didn't insert any rows.
@item
Fixed missing last character in function output. (Bug #447)
@item
Fixed a rare replication bug when a transaction spanned two or more
relay logs, and the slave was stopped while executing the part
of the transaction that was in the second or later relay log. Then
replication would resume at the beginning of the second or later
relay log, which was incorrect. (It should resume at @code{BEGIN}, in the
first relay log.) (Bug #53)
@item
@code{CONNECTION_ID()} now is properly replicated. (Bug #177)
@item
The new @code{PASSWORD()} function in 4.1 is now properly replicated.
(Bug #344)
@item
Fixed a bug with double freed memory.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{UNION} operations that involved temporary tables.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{DERIVED TABLES} when @code{EXPLAIN} is
used on a @code{DERIVED TABLES} with a join.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{DELETE} with @code{ORDER BY} and
@code{LIMIT} caused by an uninitialized array of reference pointers.
@item
Fixed a bug in the @code{USER()} function caused by an error in the size of
the allocated string.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug when attempting to create a table containing a spatial
(GIS) column with a storage engine that does not support spatial types. 
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{UNION} caused by the empty select list and
a non-existent column being used in some of the individual @code{SELECT}
statements.
@item
Fixed a replication bug with a 3.23 master and a 4.0 slave: The
slave lost the replicated temporary tables if @code{FLUSH LOGS} was
issued on the master. (Bug #254)
@item
Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still allowed
connections by users who had the @code{REQUIRE SSL} option specified for
their accounts.
@item
When an undefined user variable was used in a updating query on the
master (such as @code{INSERT INTO t VALUES(@@a)}, where @code{@@a} had never
been set by this connection before), the slave could replicate the
query incorrectly if a previous transaction on the master used a user
variable of the same name. (Bug #1331)
@item
Fixed bug with prepared statements: Using the @code{?} prepared statement
parameter as the argument to certain functions or statement clauses caused
a server crash when @code{mysql_prepare()} was invoked. (Bug #1500)
@item
Fixed bug with prepared statements: after call to mysql_prepare
placeholders became allowed in all consequent statements, even if they are 
not prepared (Bug #1946)
@item
@code{SLAVE START} (which is a deprecated syntax, @code{START SLAVE} should be
used instead) could crash the slave. (Bug #2516)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME}, when rename to the table with
the same name in another database silently dropped destination table if
it existed. (Bug #2628)

as are all the options implied by @code{--opt}.
@item
New @code{CHARSET()} and @code{COLLATION()} functions to return the character
set and collation of a string.
@item
Allow index type to be specified explicitly for some storage engines via
@code{USING type_name} syntax in index definition.
@item
New function @code{IS_USED_LOCK()} for determining the connection identifier
of the client that holds a given advisory lock.
@item
New more secure client authentication based on 45-byte passwords in the
@code{user} table.
@item
New @code{CRC32()} function to compute cyclic redundancy check value.
@item
On Windows, we are now using shared memory to communicate between server
and client when they are running on the same machine and you are
connecting to @code{localhost}.
@item
@code{REPAIR} of @code{MyISAM} tables now uses less temporary disk space when
sorting char columns.
@item
@code{DATE}/@code{DATETIME} checking is now a bit stricter to support the 
ability to automatically distinguish between date, datetime, and time
with microseconds. For example, dates of type @code{YYYYMMDD HHMMDD} are no 
longer supported; you must either have separators between each
@code{DATE}/@code{TIME} part or not at all.
@item
Server side help for all MySQL functions. One can now type @code{help
week} in the @code{mysql} client and get help for the @code{week()}
function.
@item
Added new @code{mysql_get_server_version()} C API client function.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{libmysqlclient} that fetched column defaults.
@item
Fixed bug in @file{mysql} command-line client in interpreting quotes

@code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE} now drops only temporary tables and doesn't
end transactions.
@item
Added support for @code{UNION} in derived tables.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
@code{TIMESTAMP} is now returned as a string of type
@code{'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'} and different timestamp lengths are not supported.

This change was necessary for SQL standards compliance. In a future
version, a further change will be made (backward compatible with this
change), allowing the timestamp length to indicate the desired number
of digits of fractions of a second.
@item
New faster client/server protocol that supports prepared statements,
bound parameters, and bound result columns, binary transfer of data,
warnings.
@item
Added database and real table name (in case of alias) to the
@code{MYSQL_FIELD} structure.
@item
Multi-line queries: You can now issue several queries at once and
then read the results in one go.
@item
In @code{CREATE TABLE foo (a INT not null primary key)} the
@code{PRIMARY} word is now optional.

automatically changed to @code{TEXT} or @code{BLOB}; One will get a
warning in this case.
@item
One can specify the different @code{BLOB}/@code{TEXT} types with the
syntax @code{BLOB(length)} and @code{TEXT(length)}.  MySQL will
automatically change it to one of the internal @code{BLOB}/@code{TEXT}
types.

New @code{CONVERT(... USING ...)} syntax for converting string values between
character sets.
@item
@code{BTREE} index on @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables.
@item
Faster embedded server (new internal communication protocol).
@item
One can add a comment per column in @code{CREATE TABLE}.
@item
@code{SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM tbl_name} shows column comments.
@item

New options @code{--reconnect} and @code{--skip-reconnect} for the
@code{mysql} client, to reconnect automatically or not if the
connection is lost.
@item
@code{START SLAVE} (@code{STOP SLAVE}) no longer returns an error
if the slave is already started (stopped); it returns a
warning instead.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.19 (not released yet)

@c NOTE: References to bug numbers should be written after the sentence
@c NOTE: describing the bugfix, like this:
@c NOTE: This sentence describes the fix. (Bug #nnnn)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
If length of a timestamp field is defined as 19, the timestamp will be
displayed as @code{"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}. This is done to make it easier
to use tables created in MySQL 4.1 to be used in MySQL 4.0.
@item
If you use @code{RAID_CHUNKS} with a value > 255 it will be set to 255.
This was made to ensure that all raid directories are always 2 hex bytes.
(Bug #3182)
@item
Changed that the optimizer will now consider the index specified in 
@code{FORCE INDEX} clause as a candidate to resolve @code{ORDER BY}
as well.
@item
Non-standard behavior of @code{UNION} statements has changed to the standard
ones. So far, a table name in the @code{ORDER BY} clause was
tolerated. From now on a proper error message is issued (Bug #3064).
@item
Added @code{max_insert_delayed_threads} system variable as a synonym for
@code{max_delayed_threads}.
@item
Added @code{query_cache_wlock_invalidate} system variable. It allow
emulation of @code{MyISAM} table write-locking behavior, even for queries
in the query cache. (Bug #2693)
@item
The keyword @code{MASTER_SERVER_ID} is not reserved anymore.
@item
The following is mainly relevant for Mac OS X users who use a
case-insensitive filesystem.  This is not relevant for Windows users as
@code{InnoDB} in this case always stores file names in lower case:

One can now force @code{lower_case_table_names} to 0 from the command
line or a configuration file. This is useful with case-insensitive filesystems
when you have previously not used
@code{lower_case_table_names=1} or @code{lower_case_table_names=2} and
your have already created @code{InnoDB} tables.  With
@code{lower_case_table_names=0}, @code{InnoDB} tables were stored in mixed case
while setting lower_case_table_names <> 0 will now force it to lower
case (to make the table names case insensitive).

Because it's possible to crash @code{MyISAM} tables by referring to them with
different case on a case-insensitive filesystem, we recommend that you
use @code{lower_case_table_names} or @code{lower_case_table_names=2} on
such filesystems.

The easiest way to convert to use @code{lower_case_table_names=2} is to
dump all your @code{InnoDB} tables with @code{mysqldump}, drop them and then
restore them.
@item
Non-standard behavior of @code{UNION} statements has changed to the standard
ones. So far, a table name in the @code{ORDER BY} clause was
tolerated. From now on a proper error message is issued (Bug #3064).
@item
Added @code{max_insert_delayed_threads} system variable as a synonym for
@code{max_delayed_threads}.
@item
Added @code{query_cache_wlock_invalidate} system variable. It allow
emulation of @code{MyISAM} table write-locking behavior, even for queries
in the query cache. (Bug #2693)
@item
Changed that the relay log is flushed to disk by the slave I/O thread every
time it reads a relay log event. This reduces the risk of losing some part of
the relay log in case of brutal crash.
@item
When a session having open temporary tables terminates, the statement
automatically written to the binary log is now @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF
EXISTS} instead of @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE}, for more robustness.
@item
Added option @code{--replicate-same-server-id}.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Added missing full-text variable @code{ft_stopword_file} to @code{myisamchk}.
@item
Don't allow stray @code{','} at the end of field specifications. (Bug #3481)
@item
@code{INTERVAL} now can handle big values for seconds, minutes and hours.
(Bug #3498)
@item
Blank hostname did not work as documented for table and column privileges.
Now it's works the same way as @code{'%'}. (Bug #3473)
@item
Fixed a harmless buffer overflow in @file{replace} utility. (Bug# 3541)
@item
Fixed @code{SOUNDEX()} to ignore non-alphabetic characters also
in the beginning of the string. (Bug #3556)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{MATCH ... AGAINST()} searches when another thread was
doing concurrent inserts into the @code{MyISAM} table in question.  The first
--- full-text search --- query could return incorrect results in this case
(e.g. ``phantom'' rows or not all matching rows, even an empty result set).
The easiest way to check whether you are affected is to start @file{mysqld}
with @code{--skip-concurrent-insert} switch and see if it helps.
@item
Fixed bug when doing @code{DROP DATABASE} on a directory containing non-
MySQL files. Now a proper error message is returned. 
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ANALYZE TABLE} on a @code{BDB} table inside a transaction
that hangs server thread. (Bug #2342)
@item
Fixed a symlink vulnerability in @file{mysqlbug} script. (Bug #3284)
@item
Fixed core dump bug in @code{SELECT DISTINCT} where all selected parts
where constants and there were hidden columns in the created temporary table.
(Bug #3203)
@item
Fixed core dump bug in @code{COUNT(DISTINCT)} when there was a lot of
values and one had a big value for @code{max_heap_table_size}.
@item
Fixed problem with multi-table-update and BDB tables. (Bug: #3098)
@item
Fixed memory leak when dropping database with @code{RAID} tables. (Bug #2882)
@item
Fixed core dump crash in replication during relay-log switch when the
relay log went over @code{max_relay_log_size} and the slave thread did a
@code{flush_io_cache()} at the same time.
@item
Fixed hangup bug when issuing multiple @code{SLAVE START} from different
threads at the same time. (Bug #2921)
@item
Fixed bug when using @code{DROP DATABASE} with @code{lower_case_table_names=2}.
@item
Fixed wrong result in @code{UNION} when using @code{lower_case_table_names=2}.
(Bug #2858)
@item
One can now kill threads that is 'stuck' in the join optimizer (can
happen when there is MANY tables in the join in which case the optimizer
can take really long time). (Bug #2825)
@item
Rollback @code{DELETE} and @code{UPDATE} statements if thread is killed.
(Bug #2422)
@item
Ensure that all rows in an @code{INSERT DELAYED} statement is written at
once if binary logging is enabled. (Bug #2491).
@item
Fixed bug in query cache statistic, more accurate formula linked statistic
variables mentioned in the manual.
@item
Fixed a bug in parallel repair
(@code{myisamchk -p}, @code{myisam_repair_threads}) -
sometimes repair process failed to repair a table. (Bug #1334)
@item
Fixed bugs with names of tables, databases and columns that end to space 
(Bug #2985)
@item
Fixed a bug in multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statements involving at least one constant 
table. Bug was exhibited in allowing non matching row to be updated.
(Bug #2996).
@item
Fixed all bugs in scripts for creating/upgrading system database (Bug #2874)
Added tests which guarantee against such bugs in the future.
@item
Fixed bug in @file{mysql} command-line client in interpreting quotes
within comments. (Bug #539)
@item
@code{--set-character-set} and @code{--character-sets-dir} options in
@file{myisamchk} now work.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{mysqlbinlog} that caused one pointer to be free'd twice
in some cases.
@item
Fixed a bug in boolean full-text search, that sometimes could lead to false
matches in queries with several levels of subexpressions using @code{+}
operator (for example,
@code{MATCH ... AGAINST('+(+(word1 word2)) +word3*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)}.
@item
Fixed Windows-specific portability bugs in @file{myisam_ftdump}.
@item
Fixed a bug in multiple-table @code{DELETE} that was caused by foreign key
constraints. If the order of the tables established by MySQL optimizer
did not match parent-child order, no rows were deleted and no error
message was provided. (Bug #2799)
@item 
Fixed a few years old bug in the range optimizer that
caused a segmentation fault on some very rare queries. (Bug #2698)
@item
Replication:
If a client connects to a slave server and issues an administrative
statement for a table (for example, @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or @code{REPAIR
TABLE}), this could sometimes stop the slave SQL thread. This does not lead
to any corruption, but you must use @code{START SLAVE} to get replication
going again. (Bug #1858)
The bug was accidentally not fixed in 4.0.17 as it was unfortunately
earlier said.
@item
Fixed that when a @code{Rotate} event is found by the slave SQL thread in the
middle of a transaction, the value of @code{Relay_Log_Pos} in @code{SHOW SLAVE
STATUS} remains correct. (Bug #3017)
@item
Corrected the master's binary log position that @code{InnoDB} reports when it is doing a
crash recovery on a slave server. (Bug #3015)
@item
Changed that when a @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE} statement is automatically
written to the binary log when a session ends, the statement is recorded with an
error code of value zero (this ensures that killing a @code{SELECT} on the
master does not result in a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3063)
@item
Changed that when a thread handling @code{INSERT DELAYED} (also known as a
@code{delayed_insert} thread) is killed, its statements are recorded with an
error code of value zero (killing such a thread does not endanger
replication, so we thus avoid a superfluous error on the slave). (Bug #3081)
@item
Fixed deadlock when two @code{START SLAVE} commands were run at the same
time. (Bug #2921)
@item
Fixed that a statement never triggers a superfluous error on the slave, if it
must be excluded given the @code{replicate-*} options. The bug was that if the
statement had been killed on the master, the slave would stop. (Bug #2983)
@item
The @code{--local-load} option of @code{mysqlbinlog} now requires an argument.
@item
Fixed a segmentation fault when running @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} after
@code{RESET SLAVE}. (Bug #2922)
@item
Fixed a rare error condition that caused the slave SQL thread spuriously
to print the message @code{Binlog has bad magic number} and stop when it
was not necessary to do so.  (Bug #3401)
@item
Fixed the column @code{Exec_master_log_pos} (and its disk image in the
@code{relay-log.info} file) to be correct if the master had version 3.23 (it
was too big by 6 bytes). This bug does not exist in the 5.0 version.
(Bug #3400)
@item
Fixed that @code{mysqlbinlog} does not forget to print a @code{USE} command
under rare circumstances where the binary log contained a @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} command. (Bug #3415)
@item
Fixed a memory corruption when replicating a @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} when the
master had version 3.23. Some smaller problems remain in this setup,
@xref{Replication Features}. (Bug #3422)
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were always replicated by the slave if
there were some @code{replicate-*-ignore-table} options and no
@code{replicate-*-do-table} options. (Bug #3461)
@item
Fixed a crash of the MySQL slave server when it was built with
@code{--with-debug} and replicating itself. (BUG #3568)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.18 (12 Feb 2004)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed processing of @code{LOAD DATA} by @code{mysqlbinlog} in remote mode.
(Bug #1378)
@item
New utility program @file{myisam_ftdump} was added to binary
distributions.
@item
@code{ENGINE} is now a synonym for the @code{TYPE} option for
@code{CREATE TABLE} and @code{ALTER TABLE}.
@item
@code{lower_case_table_names} system variable now can take a value of
@code{2}, to store table names in mixed case on case-insensitive filesystems.
It's forced to 2 if the database directory is located on a case-insensitive
filesystem.
@item
For replication of @code{MEMORY} (@code{HEAP}) tables: Made the master
automatically write a @code{DELETE FROM} statement to its binary log when a
@code{MEMORY} table is opened for the first time since master's startup.
This is for the case where the slave has replicated a non-empty
@code{MEMORY} table, then the master is shut down and restarted: the table
is now empty on master; the @code{DELETE FROM} empties it on slave too. Note
that even with this fix, between the master's restart and the first use of
the table on master, the slave still has out-of-date data in the table. But
if you use the @code{init-file} option to populate the @code{MEMORY} table
on the master at startup, it ensures that the failing time interval is zero.
(Bug #2477)
@item
Optimizer is now better tuned for the case where the first used key part
(of many) is a constant.  (Bug #1679)
@item
Removed old non-working @code{--old-rpl-compat} server option, which was a
holdover from the very first 4.0.x versions. (Bug #2428)
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysqlhotcopy} now works on NetWare.
@item
@code{DROP DATABASE} could not drop databases with RAID tables that had
more than nine @code{RAID_CHUNKS}. (Bug #2627)
@item
Fixed bug in range optimizer when using overlapping ranges. (Bug #2448)
@item
Limit @code{wait_timeout} to 2147483 on Windows (OS limit). (Bug #2400)
@item
Fixed bug when @code{--init-file} crashes MySQL if it contains a large
@code{SELECT}. (Bug #2526)
@item
@code{SHOW KEYS} now shows @code{NULL} in the @code{Sub_part} column for
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes.
@item
The signal thread's stack size was increased to enable @code{mysqld}
to run on Debian/IA-64 with a TLS-enabled @code{glibc}. (Bug #2599)
@item
Now only the @code{SELECT} privilege is needed for tables that are only read in
multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statements. (Bug #2377)
@item
Give proper error message if one uses @code{LOCK TABLES ... ; INSERT
... SELECT} and one used the same table in the @code{INSERT} and @code{SELECT}
part. (Bug #2296)
@item
@code{SELECT INTO ... DUMPFILE} now deletes the generated file on error.
@item
Fixed foreign key reference handling to allow references to column names that
contain spaces. (Bug #1725)
@item
Fixed problem with index reads on character columns with @code{BDB} tables. The
symptom was that data could be returned in the wrong lettercase. (Bug #2509)
@item
Fixed a spurious table corruption problem that could sometimes appear on
tables with indexed @code{TEXT} columns if these columns happened to contain
values having trailing spaces.  This bug was introduced in 4.0.17.
@item
Fixed a problem where some queries could hang if a condition like
@code{indexed_TEXT_column = expr}
was present and the column contained values having trailing spaces.
This bug was introduced in 4.0.17.
@item
Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect results from a query
that involved range conditions on indexed @code{TEXT} columns
that happened to contain values having trailing spaces. This bug was
introduced in 4.0.17. (Bug #2295)
@item
Fixed incorrect path names in some of the manual pages.
(Bug #2270)
@item
Fixed spurious ``table corrupted'' errors in parallel repair operations.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in parallel repair operations.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item
Fixed bug in updating @code{MyISAM} tables for @code{BLOB} values longer
than 16MB. (Bug #2159)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{mysqld_safe} when running multiple instances of
MySQL. (Bug #2114)
@item
Fixed a bug in using @code{HANDLER} statement with tables not
from a current database. (Bug #2304)
@item
Fixed a crashing bug that occurred due to the fact that multiple-table
@code{UPDATE} statements did not check that there was only one table
to be updated. (Bug #2103)
@item
Fixed a crashing bug that occurred due to @code{BLOB} column
type index size being calculated incorrectly in @code{MIN()} and @code{MAX()}
optimizations.
(Bug #2189)
@item
Fixed a bug with incorrect syntax for @code{LOCK TABLES} in
@code{mysqldump}. (Bug #2242)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{mysqld_safe} that caused @code{mysqld} to generate a
warning about duplicate @code{user=xxx} options if this option was specified in
the @code{[mysqld]} or @code{[server]} sections of @file{my.cnf}.
(Bug #2163)
@item
@code{INSERT DELAYED ... SELECT ...} could cause table corruption because
tables were not locked properly.  This is now fixed by ignoring @code{DELAYED}
in this context. (Bug #1983)
@item
Replication: Sometimes the master gets a non-fatal error during the
execution of a statement that does not immediately succeed.  (For example,
a write to a @code{MyISAM} table may first receive ``no space left
on device,'' but later complete when disk space becomes available.
@xref{Full disk}.)  The bug was that the master forgot to reset the error
code to 0 after success, so the error code got into its binary log, thus
causing the slave to issue false alarms such as ``did not get the same
error as on master.'' (Bug #2083)
@item
Removed a misleading ``check permissions on master.info'' from a replication
error message, because the cause of the problem could be something other than
permissions. (Bug #2121)
@item
Fixed a crash when the replication slave was unable to create the first relay
log. (Bug #2145)
@item
Replication of @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} for an empty file from a 3.23 master to a
4.0 slave caused the slave to print an error. (Bug #2452)
@item
When automatically forcing @code{lower_case_table_names} to 1 if the file
system was case insensitive, @code{mysqld} could crash. This bug existed only
in MySQL 4.0.17. (Bug #2481)
@item
Restored ability to specify default values for @code{TIMESTAMP} columns
that was erroneously disabled in previous release. (Bug #2539) Fixed
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} to reflect these values. (Bug #1885) Note
that because of the auto-update feature for the first @code{TIMESTAMP}
column in a table, it makes no sense to specify a default value for
the column. Any such default will be silently ignored (unless another
@code{TIMESTAMP} column is added before this one).  Also fixed the meaning
of the @code{DEFAULT} keyword when it is used to specify the value to be
inserted into a @code{TIMESTAMP} column other than the first. (Bug #2464)
@item
Fixed bug for out-of-range arguments on QNX platform that caused
@code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} to produce incorrect results or that caused
non-zero values to be inserted into @code{TIMESTAMP} columns.  (Bug #2523)
Also, current time zone now is taken into account when checking if datetime
values satisfy both range boundaries for @code{TIMESTAMP} columns. The
range allowed for a @code{TIMESTAMP} column is time zone-dependent and
equivalent to a range of @code{1970-01-01 00:00:01} UTC to @code{2037-12-31
23:59:59} UTC.
@item
Multiple-table @code{DELETE} statements were never replicated by the slave if
there were any @code{replicate-*-table} options. (Bug #2527)
@item
Changes to session counterparts of variables @code{query_prealloc_size},
@code{query_alloc_block_size}, @code{trans_prealloc_size},
@code{trans_alloc_block_size} now 
have an effect. (Bug #1948)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME}, when rename to the table with
the same name in another database silently dropped destination table if
it existed. (Bug #2628)
@end itemize

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.17 (14 Dec 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysqldump} no longer dumps data for @code{MERGE} tables. (Bug #1846)
@item
@code{lower_case_table_names} is now forced to 1 if the database directory
is located on a case-insensitive filesystem. (Bug #1812)
@item
Symlink creation is now disabled on systems where @code{realpath()} doesn't
work. (Before one could use @code{CREATE TABLE .. DATA DIRECTORY=..} even if
@code{HAVE_BROKEN_REALPATH} was defined. This is now disabled to avoid
problems when running @code{ALTER TABLE}).
@item
Inserting a negative @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value in a @code{MyISAM} table 
no longer updates the @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} counter to a big unsigned value.
(Bug #1366)
@item
Added four new modes to @code{WEEK(..., mode)} function.
@xref{Date and time functions, , @code{WEEK(date,mode)}}.
(Bug #1178)
@item
Allow @code{UNION DISTINCT} syntax.
@item
@code{mysql_server_init()} now returns 1 if it can't initialize the
environment. (Previously @code{mysql_server_init()} called @code{exit(1)}
if it could not create a key with @code{pthread_key_create()}. (Bug #2062)
@item
Allow spaces in Windows service names.
@item
Changed the default Windows service name for @code{mysqld} from @code{MySql}
to @code{MySQL}.
This should not affect usage, because service names are not case sensitive.
@item
When you install @code{mysqld} as a service on Windows systems, @code{mysqld}
will read startup options in option files from the option group with the same
name as the service name.
(Except when the service name is @code{MySQL}).
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Sending @code{SIGHUP} to @code{mysqld} crashed the server if it was running with
@code{--log-bin}. (Bug #2045)
@item
One can now configure MySQL as a Windows service as a normal
user. (Bug #1802). Thanks to Richard Hansen for fixing this.
@item
Database names are now compared in lowercase in @code{ON} clauses
when @code{lower_case_table_names} is set. (Bug #1736)
@item
@code{IGNORE ... LINES} option to @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} didn't work
when used with fixed length rows. (Bug #1704)
@item
Fixed problem with @code{UNIX_TIMESTAMP()} for timestamps close to 0.
(Bug #1998)
@item
Fixed problem with character values greater than 128 in the @code{QUOTE()}
function. (Bug #1868)
@item
Fixed searching of @code{TEXT} with endspace. (Bug #1651)
@item
Fixed caching bug in multiple-table updates where same table was used twice.
(Bug #1711)
@item
Fixed directory permissions for the MySQL-server RPM documentation directory.
(Bug #1672)
@item
Fixed server crash when updating an @code{ENUM} column that is set to the
empty string (for example, with @code{REPLACE()}).  (Bug #2023)
@item
@code{mysql} client program now correctly prints connection identifier
returned by @code{mysql_thread_id()} as unsigned integer rather than as signed
integer.  (Bug #1951)
@item
@code{FOUND_ROWS()} could return incorrect number of rows after a query
with an impossible @code{WHERE} condition. (Bug #1468)
@item
@code{SHOW DATABASES} no longer shows @code{.sym} files (on Windows) that
do not point to a valid directory. (Bug #1385)
@item
Fixed a possible memory leak on Mac OS X when using the shared
@code{libmysql.so} library. (from @code{pthread_key_create()}). (Bug #2061)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{UNION} statement with alias @code{*}. (Bug #1249)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{DELETE ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT} where the rows where not
deleted in the proper order. (Bug #1024, Bug #1697).
@item
Fixed serious problem with multi-threaded programs on Windows that used the
embedded MySQL libraries. (Locks of tables were not handled correctly between
different threads).
@item
Code cleanup: Fixed a few code defects (potential memory leaks, null pointer
dereferences, uninitialized variables). Thanks to Reasoning Inc. for
informing us about these findings.
@item
Fixed a buffer overflow error that occurred with prepended @samp{0} characters
in some columns of type @code{DECIMAL}. (Bug #2128)
@item
Filesort was never shown in @code{EXPLAIN} if query contained an
@code{ORDER BY NULL} clause. (Bug #1335)
@item
Fixed invalidation of whole query cache on @code{DROP DATABASE}. (Bug #1898)
@item
Fixed bug in range optimizer that caused wrong results for some unlikely
@code{AND}/@code{OR} queries. (Bug #1828)
@item
Fixed a crash in @code{ORDER BY} when ordering by expression and identifier.
(Bug #1945)
@item
Fixed a crash in an open @code{HANDLER} when an @code{ALTER TABLE} was
executed in a different connection. (Bug #1826)
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{trunc*} operator of full-text search which
sometimes caused MySQL not to find all matched rows.
@item
Fixed bug in prepending @samp{0} characters to @code{DECIMAL} column values.
@item
Fixed optimizer bug, introduced in 4.0.16, when @code{REF} access plan was
preferred to more efficient @code{RANGE} on another column.
@item
Fixed problem when installing a MySQL server as a Windows service using a
command of the form @code{mysqld --install mysql --defaults-file=path-to-file}.
(Bug #1643)
@item
Fixed an incorrect result from a query that uses only @code{const} tables
(such as one-row tables) and non-constant expression
(such as @code{RAND()}). (Bug #1271)
@item
Fixed bug when the optimizer did not take @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} into
account if @code{LIMIT} clause was present. (Bug #1274)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} now asks for a password at the console when the @code{-p}
or @code{--password} option is used with no argument. This is consistent with
the way that other clients such @code{mysqladmin} and @code{mysqldump}
already behave. @strong{Note:} A consequence of this change is that it is no
longer possible to invoke @code{mysqlbinlog} as @code{mysqlbinlog -p
pass_val} (with a space between the @code{-p} option and the following
password value).
(Bug #1595)
@item
Fixed bug accidentally introduced in 4.0.16 where the slave SQL thread
deleted its replicated temporary tables when @code{STOP SLAVE} was
issued.
@item
In a ``chain'' replication setup @code{A->B->C}, if 2 sessions on A
updated temporary tables of the same name at the same time, the binary log
of @code{B} became incorrect, resulting in @code{C} becoming confused.
(Bug #1686)
@item
In a ``chain'' replication setup @code{A->B->C}, if @code{STOP SLAVE}
was issued on @code{B} while it was replicating a temporary table from
@code{A}, then when @code{START SLAVE} was issued on @code{B}, the binary log
of @code{B} became incorrect, resulting in @code{C} becoming confused.
(Bug #1240)
@item
When @code{MASTER_LOG_FILE} and @code{MASTER_LOG_POS} were not
specified, @code{CHANGE MASTER} used the coordinates of the slave I/O
thread to set up replication, which broke replication if the slave SQL
thread lagged behind the slave I/O thread. This caused the slave
SQL thread to lose some events. The new behavior is to use the
coordinates of the slave SQL thread instead.
@xref{CHANGE MASTER TO,  , @code{CHANGE MASTER TO}}.
(Bug #1870)
@item
Now if integer is stored or converted to @code{TIMESTAMP} or
@code{DATETIME} value checks of year, month, day, hour, minute
and second ranges are performed and numbers representing illegal
timestamps are converted to 0 value. This behavior is consistent 
with manual and with behavior of string to 
@code{TIMESTAMP}/@code{DATETIME} conversion. (Bug #1448)
@item
Fixed bug when @code{BIT_AND()} and @code{BIT_OR()} group functions 
returned incorrect value if @code{SELECT} used a temporary table and
no rows were found. (Bug #1790).
@item
@code{BIT_AND()} is now unsigned in all contexts. This means that it will
now return 18446744073709551615 (= 0xffffffffffffffff) instead of -1 if
there were no rows in the result.
@item
Fixed bug with @code{BIT_AND()} still returning signed value for an
empty set in some cases. (Bug #1972)
@item
Fixed bug with @code{^} (XOR) and @code{>>} (bit shift) still returning
signed value in some cases. (Bug #1993)
@item
Replication:
a rare race condition in the slave SQL thread, which could lead to a
wrong complain that the relay log is corrupted. (Bug #2011)
@item
Replication:
in the slave SQL thread, a multiple-table @code{UPDATE} could produce a
wrong complain that some record was not found in one table, if the
@code{UPDATE} was preceded by a @code{INSERT ... SELECT}. (Bug #1701)
@item
Fixed deficiency in MySQL code which is responsible for scanning 
directories. This deficiency caused @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} to be 
very slow when a database contained a large number of tables, even if a single 
particular table were specified. (Bug #1952)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.16 (17 Oct 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Option values in option files now may be quoted. This is useful for values that
contain whitespace or comment characters.
@item
Write memory allocation information to error log when doing
@code{mysqladmin debug}.  This works only on systems that support the
@code{mallinfo()} call (like newer Linux systems).
@item
Added the following new server variables to allow more precise memory
allocation: @code{range_alloc_block_size}, @code{query_alloc_block_size},
@code{query_prealloc_size}, @code{transaction_alloc_block_size}, and
@code{transaction_prealloc_size}.
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} now reads option files. To make this work, you must now
specify @code{--read-from-remote-server} when reading binary logs from
a MySQL server. (Note that using a remote server is deprecated and may
disappear in future @code{mysqlbinlog} versions).
@item
Block @code{SIGPIPE} signals also for non-threaded programs. The blocking is moved
from @code{mysql_init()} to @code{mysql_server_init()}, which is
automatically called on the first call to @code{mysql_init()}.
@item
Added @code{--libs_r} and @code{--include} options to @code{mysql_config}.
@item
New @code{`>} prompt for @code{mysql}. This prompt is similar to the
@code{'>} and @code{">} prompts, but indicates that an identifier
quoted with backticks was begun on an earlier line and the closing backtick
has not yet been seen.
@item
Updated @code{mysql_install_db} to be able to use the local machine's IP
address instead of the hostname when building the initial grant tables if
@code{skip-name-resolve} has been specified. This
option can be helpful on FreeBSD to avoid thread-safety problems with the
FreeBSD resolver libraries. (Thanks to Jeremy Zawodny for the patch.)
@item
A documentation change: Added a note that when backing up a slave, it is
necessary also to back up the @file{master.info} and @file{relay-log.info}
files, as well as any @file{SQL_LOAD-*} files located in the directory
specified by the @code{--slave-load-tmpdir} option.  All these files are
needed when the slave resumes replication after you restore the slave's data.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a spurious error @code{ERROR 14: Can't change size of file (Errcode: 2)}
on Windows in @code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} without a @code{WHERE} clause or
@code{TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name}, when @code{tbl_name} is a @code{MyISAM}
table. (Bug #1397)
@item
Fixed a bug that resulted in @code{thr_alarm queue is full} warnings after
increasing the @code{max_connections} variable with @code{SET GLOBAL}.
(Bug #1435)
@item
Made @code{LOCK TABLES} to work when @code{Lock_tables_priv} is granted on the
database level and @code{Select_priv} is granted on the table level.
@item
Fixed crash of @code{FLUSH QUERY CACHE} on queries that use same table
several times (Bug #988).
@item
Fixed core dump bug when setting an enum system variable (such as
@code{SQL_WARNINGS}) to @code{NULL}.
@item
Extended the default timeout value for Windows clients from 30 seconds
to 1 year.  (The timeout that was added in MySQL 4.0.15 was way too
short).  This fixes a bug that caused @code{ERROR 2013: Lost connection
to MySQL server during query} for queries that lasted longer than 30 seconds,
if the client didn't specify a limit with @code{mysql_options()}. Users of
4.0.15 on Windows should upgrade to avoid this problem.
@item
More ``out of memory'' checking in range optimizer.
@item
Fixed and documented a problem when setting and using a user variable within the
same @code{SELECT} statement. (Bug #1194).
@item
Fixed bug in overrun check for @code{BLOB} values with compressed tables.
This was a bug introduced in 4.0.14.  It caused MySQL to regard some
correct tables containing @code{BLOB} values as corrupted.
(Bug #770, Bug #1304, and maybe Bug #1295)
@item
@code{SHOW GRANTS} showed @code{USAGE} instead of the real column-level
privileges when no table-level privileges were given.
@item
When copying a database from the master, @code{LOAD DATA FROM
MASTER} dropped the corresponding database on the slave, thus erroneously
dropping tables that had no counterpart on the master and tables that
may have been excluded from replication using @code{replicate-*-table}
rules. Now @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} no longer drops the database.
Instead, it drops only the tables that have a counterpart on the master
and that match the @code{replicate-*-table}
rules. @code{replicate-*-db} rules can still be used to include or exclude a
database as a whole from @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER}. A database will
also be included or excluded as a whole if there are some rules like
@code{replicate-wild-do-table=db1.%} or
@code{replicate-wild-ignore-table=db1.%}, as is already the case for
@code{CREATE DATABASE} and @code{DROP DATABASE} in replication. (Bug
#1248)
@item
Fixed a bug where
@code{mysqlbinlog} crashed with a segmentation fault when used with the
@code{-h} or @code{--host} option. (Bug #1258)
@item
Fixed a bug where @code{mysqlbinlog} crashed with a segmentation fault
when used on a binary log containing only final events for @code{LOAD
DATA}. (Bug #1340)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} will not reuse temporary file names from previous runs.
Previously @code{mysqlbinlog} failed if was used several times on the same
binary log file that contained a @code{LOAD DATA} command.
@item
Fixed compilation problem when compiling with OpenSSL 0.9.7 with
disabled old DES support (If @code{OPENSSL_DISABLE_OLD_DES_SUPPORT} 
option was enabled).
@item
Fixed a bug when two (or more) MySQL servers were running on the same machine,
and they were both slaves, and at least one of them was replicating some
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} command from its master.
The bug was that one slave MySQL server sometimes
deleted the @file{SQL_LOAD-*} files (used for replication of
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} and located in the @code{slave-load-tmpdir} directory,
which defaults to @code{tmpdir}) belonging to the other slave MySQL server of
this machine, if these slaves had the same @code{slave-load-tmpdir} directory.
When that happened, the other slave could not replicate
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} and complained about not being able to open some
@code{SQL_LOAD-*} file. (Bug #1357)
@item
If @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} failed for a small file, the master forgot to
write a marker (a @code{Delete_file} event) in its binary log, so the slave
could not delete 2 files (@file{SQL_LOAD-*.info} and
@file{SQL_LOAD-*.data} from its @code{tmpdir}. (Bug #1391)
@item
On Windows, the slave forgot to delete a @code{SQL_LOAD-*.info}
file from @code{tmpdir} after successfully replicating a @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE} command. (Bug #1392)
@item
When a connection terminates, MySQL writes @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE}
statements to the binary log for all temporary tables which the
connection had not explicitly dropped. MySQL forgot to backquote the
database and table names in the statement. (Bug #1345)
@item
On some 64-bit machines (some HP-UX and Solaris machines), a slave
installed with the 64-bit MySQL binary could not connect to its master
(it connected to itself instead). (Bug #1256, Bug #1381)
@item
Code was introduced in MySQL 4.0.15 for the slave to detect that the master
had died while writing a transaction to its binary log. This code reported an
error in a legal situation: When the slave I/O thread was stopped while
copying a transaction to the relay log, the slave SQL thread would later
pretend that it found an unfinished transaction. (Bug #1475)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.15 (03 Sep 2003)

@strong{IMPORTANT}:

If you are using this release on Windows, you should upgrade at least your
clients (any program that uses @code{libmysql.lib}) to 4.0.16 or above.  This
is because the 4.0.15 release had a bug in the Windows client library that
causes Windows clients using the library to die with a @code{Lost connection
to MySQL server during query} error for queries that take more than 30
seconds.  This problem is specific to Windows; clients on other platforms are
unaffected.

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysqldump} now correctly quotes all identifiers when communicating
with the server. This assures that during the dump process, @code{mysqldump}
will never send queries to the server that result in a syntax error.
This problem is @strong{not} related to the
@code{mysqldump} program's output, which was not changed. (Bug #1148)
@item
Change result set metadata information so that @code{MIN()} and @code{MAX()}
report that they can return @code{NULL} (this is true because an
empty set will return @code{NULL}). (Bug #324)
@item
Produce an error message on Windows if a second @code{mysqld} server is
started on the same TCP/IP port as an already running @code{mysqld} server.
@item
The @code{mysqld} server variables @code{wait_timeout},
@code{net_read_timeout}, and @code{net_write_timeout} now work on Windows.
One can now also set timeouts for read and writes in Windows clients with
@code{mysql_options()}.
@item
Added option @code{--sql-mode=NO_DIR_IN_CREATE} to make it possible for
slaves to ignore @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} and
@code{DATA DIRECTORY} options given to @code{CREATE TABLE}.
When this is mode is on, @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} will not show the
given directories.
@item
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} now shows the @code{INDEX DIRECTORY} and
@code{DATA DIRECTORY} options, if they were specified when the table was
created.
@item
The @code{open_files_limit} server variable now shows the real open files limit.
@item
@code{MATCH ... AGAINST()} in natural language mode
now treats words that are present
in more than 2,000,000 rows as stopwords.
@item
The Mac OS X installation disk images now include an additional
@file{MySQLStartupItem.pkg} package that enables the automatic
startup of MySQL on system startup.
@xref{Mac OS X installation}.
@item
Most of the documentation included in the binary tarball distributions
(@code{.tar.gz}) has been moved into a subdirectory @code{docs}.
@xref{Installation layouts}.
@item
The manual is now included as an additional @code{info} file in the binary
distributions. (Bug #1019)
@item
The binary distributions now include the embedded server library 
(@code{libmysqld.a}) by default. Due to a linking problem with non-gcc
compilers, it was not included in all packages of the initial 4.0.15
release. The affected packages were rebuilt and released as 4.0.15a.
@xref{Nutshell Embedded MySQL}.
@item
MySQL can now use range optimization for @code{BETWEEN} with
non-constant limits. (Bug #991)
@item
Replication error messages now include the default database, so that
users can check which database the failing query was run for.
@item
A documentation change: Added a paragraph about how the
@code{binlog-do-db} and @code{binlog-ignore-db} options are tested
against the database on the master (@pxref{Binary log}), and a
paragraph about how @code{replicate-do-db}, @code{replicate-do-table}
and analogous options are tested against the database and tables on the
slave (@pxref{Replication Options}).
@item
Now the slave does not replicate @code{SET PASSWORD}
if it is configured to exclude the @code{mysql} database from
replication (using for example
@code{replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%}). This was already the
case for @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} since version 4.0.13 (although
there was Bug #980 in 4.0.13 & 4.0.14, which has been fixed in
4.0.15).
@item
Rewrote the information shown in the @code{State} column of @code{SHOW
PROCESSLIST} for replication threads and for @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()}
and added the most common states for these threads to the
documentation, @pxref{Replication Implementation Details}.
@item
Added a test in replication to detect the case where the master died
in the middle of writing a transaction to the binary log; such unfinished
transactions now trigger an error message on the slave.
@item
A @code{GRANT} command that creates an anonymous user
(that is, an account with an empty username) no longer requires
@code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} for the account to be recognized by the server.
(Bug #473)
@item
@code{CHANGE MASTER} now flushes @file{relay-log.info}. Previously
this was deferred to the next run of @code{START SLAVE}, so if
@code{mysqld} was shutdown on the slave after @code{CHANGE MASTER}
without having run @code{START SLAVE}, the relay log's name and
position were lost. At restart they were reloaded from
@file{relay-log.info}, thus reverting to their old (incorrect) values from
before @code{CHANGE MASTER} and leading to error messages 
(as the old relay log did not exist any more) and the slave threads
refusing to start. (Bug #858)
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed buffer overflow in password handling which could potentially be
exploited by MySQL users with @code{ALTER} privilege on the
@code{mysql.user} table to execute random code or to gain shell access with
the UID of the @code{mysqld} process (thanks to Jedi/Sector One for spotting and
reporting this bug).
@item
Fixed server crash on @code{FORCE INDEX} in a query that contained
"Range checked for each record" in the @code{EXPLAIN} output. (Bug #1172)
@item
Fixed table/column grant handling - proper sort order (from most specific
to less specific, @pxref{Request access}) was not honored.
(Bug #928)
@item
Fixed rare bug in @code{MYISAM} introduced in 4.0.3 where the index file header
was not updated directly after an @code{UPDATE} of split dynamic rows.
The symptom was that the table had a corrupted delete-link if @code{mysqld}
was shut down or the table was checked directly after the update.
@item
Fixed @code{Can't unlock file} error when running
@code{myisamchk --sort-index} on Windows. (Bug #1119)
@item
Fixed possible deadlock when changing @code{key_buffer_size} while
the key cache was actively used. (Bug #1088)
@item
Fixed overflow bug in @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} when a row is updated
in a table with a large number of columns and at least one @code{BLOB/TEXT}
column.
@item
Fixed incorrect result when doing @code{UNION} and @code{LIMIT #,#} when
braces were not used around the @code{SELECT} parts.
@item
Fixed incorrect result when doing @code{UNION} and @code{ORDER BY .. LIMIT #}
when one didn't use braces around the @code{SELECT} parts.
@item
Fixed problem with @code{SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ... UNION ALL ... LIMIT #}
where @code{FOUND_ROWS()} returned incorrect number of rows.
@item
Fixed unlikely stack bug when having a BIG expression of
type @code{1+1-1+1-1...} in certain combinations. (Bug #871)
@item
Fixed the bug that sometimes prevented a table with a @code{FULLTEXT} index
from being marked as "analyzed".
@item
Fixed MySQL so that the column length (in C API) for the second column in
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} is always larger than the data length.
The only known application that was affected by the old behavior was
Borland dbExpress, which truncated the output from the command.
(Bug #1064)
@item
Fixed crash in comparisons of strings using the @code{tis620} character
set. (Bug #1116)
@item
Fixed @code{ISAM} bug in @code{MAX()} optimization.
@item
@code{myisamchk --sort-records=N} no longer marks table as crashed if
sorting failed because of an inappropriate key. (Bug #892)
@item
Fixed a minor bug in @code{MyISAM} compressed table handling that sometimes
made it impossible to repair compressed table in "Repair by sort" mode.
"Repair with keycache" (@code{myisamchk --safe-recover}) worked, though.
(Bug #1015)
@item
Fixed bug in propagating the version number to the manual included in
the distribution files. (Bug #1020)
@item
Fixed key sorting problem (a @code{PRIMARY} key declared for a column
that is not explicitly marked @code{NOT NULL} was sorted after a
@code{UNIQUE} key for a @code{NOT NULL} column).
@item
Fixed the result of @code{INTERVAL} when applied to a @code{DATE} value.
(Bug #792)
@item
Fixed compiling of the embedded server library in the RPM spec file.
(Bug #959)
@item
Added some missing files to the RPM spec file and fixed some RPM building
errors that occurred on Red Hat Linux 9. (Bug #998)
@item
Fixed incorrect @code{XOR} evaluation in @code{WHERE} clause. (Bug #992)
@item
Fixed bug with processing in query cache merged tables constructed
from more then 255 tables. (Bug #930) 
@item
Fixed incorrect results from outer join query (e.g. @code{LEFT JOIN})
when @code{ON} condition is always false, and range search in used.  
(Bug #926)
@item
Fixed a bug causing incorrect results from @code{MATCH ... AGAINST()} in some
joins. (Bug #942)
@item
@code{MERGE} tables do not ignore "Using index" (from @code{EXPLAIN} output)
anymore.
@item
Fixed a bug that prevented an empty table from being marked as "analyzed".
(Bug #937)
@item
Fixed @code{myisamchk --sort-records} crash when used on compressed table.
@item
Fixed slow (as compared to 3.23)
@code{ALTER TABLE} and related commands such as @code{CREATE INDEX}.
(Bug #712)
@item
Fixed segmentation fault resulting from @code{LOAD DATA FROM MASTER} when
the master was running without the @code{--log-bin} option. (Bug #934)
@item
Fixed a security bug: A server compiled without SSL support still allowed
connections by users who had the @code{REQUIRE SSL} option specified for
their accounts.
@item
Fixed a random bug: Sometimes the slave would replicate @code{GRANT}
or @code{REVOKE} queries even if it was configured to exclude the
@code{mysql} database from replication (for example, using
@code{replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%}). (Bug #980)
@item
The @code{Last_Errno} and @code{Last_Error} fields in the output of
@code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} are now cleared by @code{CHANGE MASTER} and
when the slave SQL thread starts. (Bug #986)
@item
A documentation mistake: It said that @code{RESET SLAVE} does not change
connection information  (master host, port, user, and
password), whereas it does. The statement resets these to the startup options
(@code{master-host} etc) if there were some. (Bug #985)
@item
@code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} now shows correct information (master host,
port, user, and password) after @code{RESET SLAVE}
(that is, it shows the new values, which are copied from the startup
options if there were some). (Bug #985)
@item
Disabled propagation of the original master's log position for events because
this caused unexpected values for @code{Exec_Master_Log_Pos} and problems
with @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} in A->B->C replication setup. (Bug #1086)
@item
Fixed a segfault in @code{mysqlbinlog} when
@code{--position=x} was used with @code{x} being between a
@code{Create_file} event and its fellow @code{Append_block},
@code{Exec_load} or @code{Delete_file} events. (Bug #1091)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} printed superfluous warnings when using
@code{--database}, which caused syntax errors when piped to
@code{mysql}. (Bug #1092)
@item
Made @code{mysqlbinlog --database} filter @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} too
(previously, it filtered all queries except @code{LOAD DATA
INFILE}). (Bug #1093)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} in some cases forgot to put a leading @code{'#'} in
front of the original @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} (this command is
displayed only for information, not to be run; it is later reworked to
@code{LOAD DATA LOCAL} with a different filename, for execution by
@code{mysql}). (Bug #1096)
@item
@code{binlog-do-db} and @code{binlog-ignore-db} incorrectly filtered
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} (it was half-written to the binary log). This
resulted in a corrupted binary log, which could cause the slave to
stop with an error. (Bug #1100)
@item
When, in a transaction, a transactional table (such as an @code{InnoDB} table)
was updated, and later in the same transaction a
non-transactional table (such as a @code{MyISAM} table) was
updated using the updated content of the transactional table
(with @code{INSERT ... SELECT} for example), the queries were written
to the binary log in an incorrect order. (Bug #873)
@item
When, in a transaction, @code{INSERT ... SELECT} updated a
non-transactional table, and @code{ROLLBACK} was issued, no error was
returned to the client. Now the client is warned that some changes
could not be rolled back, as this was already the case for normal
@code{INSERT}. (Bug #1113)
@item
Fixed a potential bug: When @code{STOP SLAVE} was run while the slave
SQL thread was in the middle of a transaction, and then @code{CHANGE
MASTER} was used to point the slave to some non-transactional
statement, the slave SQL thread could get confused (because it would
still think, from the past, that it was in a transaction).

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.14 (18 Jul 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Added @code{default_week_format} system variable. The value is used as the
default mode for the @code{WEEK()} function.
@item
@code{mysqld} now reads an additional option file group having a name
corresponding to the server's release series:
@code{[mysqld-4.0]} for 4.0.x servers, @code{[mysqld-4.1]} for 4.1.x servers,
and so forth. This allows options to be specified on a series-specific basis.
@item
The @code{CONCAT_WS()} function no longer skips empty strings. (Bug #586).
@item
@code{InnoDB} now supports indexing a prefix of a column. This means, in
particular, that @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT} columns can be indexed in
@code{InnoDB} tables, which was not possible before.
@item
A documentation change: Function @code{INTERVAL(NULL, ...)} returns @code{-1}.
@item
Enabled @code{INSERT} from @code{SELECT} when the table into which the records
are inserted is also a table listed in the @code{SELECT}.
@item
Allow @code{CREATE TABLE} and @code{INSERT} from any @code{UNION}.
@item
The @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} option now always returns the total number 
of rows for any @code{UNION}.
@item
Removed @code{--table} option from @code{mysqlbinlog} 
to avoid repeating @code{mysqldump} functionality.
@item
Comment lines in option files can now start from the middle of a line, too
(like @code{basedir=c:\mysql # installation directory}).
@item
Changed optimizer slightly to prefer index lookups over full table scans
in some boundary cases.
@item
Added thread-specific @code{max_seeks_for_key} variable that can
be used to force the optimizer to use keys instead of table scans
even if the cardinality of the index is low.
@item
Added optimization that converts @code{LEFT JOIN} to normal join in
some cases.
@item
A documentation change: added a paragraph about failover in
replication (how to use a surviving slave as the new master, how to
resume to the original setup). @xref{Replication FAQ}.
@item
A documentation change: added warning notes about safe use of the
@code{CHANGE MASTER} command. @xref{CHANGE MASTER TO}.
@item
MySQL now issues a warning (not an error, as in 4.0.13)
when it opens a table that was created with MySQL 4.1.
@item
Added @code{--nice} option to @code{mysqld_safe} to allow setting the
niceness of the @code{mysqld} process. (Thanks to Christian Hammers for
providing the initial patch.) (Bug #627)
@item
Added @code{--read-only} option to cause @code{mysqld} to allow no updates
except from slave threads or from users with the @code{SUPER} privilege.
(Original patch from Markus Benning).
@item
@code{SHOW BINLOG EVENTS FROM x} where @code{x} is less than 4 now
silently converts @code{x} to 4 instead of printing an error. The same change
was done for @code{CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_POS=x} and 
@code{CHANGE MASTER TO RELAY_LOG_POS=x}.
@item
@code{mysqld} now only adds an interrupt handler for the @code{SIGINT} signal
if you start it with the new @code{--gdb} option.  This is because some
MySQL users encountered strange problems when they accidentally sent @code{SIGINT} to
@code{mysqld} threads.
@item
@code{RESET SLAVE} now clears the @code{Last_Errno} and
@code{Last_Error} fields in the output of @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}.
@item
Added @code{max_relay_log_size} variable; the relay log will be rotated
automatically when its size exceeds @code{max_relay_log_size}. But if
@code{max_relay_log_size} is 0 (the default), @code{max_binlog_size}
will be used (as in older versions). @code{max_binlog_size} still
applies to binary logs in any case.
@item
@code{FLUSH LOGS} now rotates relay logs in addition to the other types of
logs it already rotated.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Comparison/sorting for @code{latin1_de} character set was rewritten.
The old algorithm could not handle cases like @code{"s@"a" > "@ss{}a"}.
@xref{German character set}. In rare cases it resulted in table
corruption.
@item
Fixed a problem with the password prompt on Windows. (Bug #683)
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE ... UNION=(...)} for @code{MERGE} table is now allowed
even if some underlying @code{MyISAM} tables are read-only. (Bug #702)
@item
Fixed a problem with @code{CREATE TABLE t1 SELECT x'41'}. (Bug #801)
@item
Removed some incorrect lock warnings from the error log.
@item
Fixed memory overrun when doing @code{REPAIR} on a table with a multi-part
auto_increment key where one part was a packed @code{CHAR}.
@item
Fixed a probable race condition in the replication code that could
potentially lead to @code{INSERT} statements not being replicated in the
event of a @code{FLUSH LOGS} command or when the binary log exceeds
@code{max_binlog_size}. (Bug #791)
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{INTERVAL} and @code{GROUP BY} or 
@code{DISTINCT}. (Bug #807)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{mysqlhotcopy} so it actually aborts for unsuccessful
table copying operations.  Fixed another bug so that it succeeds
when there are thousands of tables to copy. (Bug #812)
@item
Fixed problem with @code{mysqlhotcopy} failing to read options from option
files. (Bug #808)
@item
Fixed bugs in optimizer that sometimes prevented MySQL from using
@code{FULLTEXT} indexes even though it was possible (for example, in
@code{SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE MATCH a,b AGAINST("index") > 0}).
@item
Fixed a bug with ``table is full'' in @code{UNION} operations.
@item
Fixed a security problem that enabled users with no privileges to obtain
information on the list of existing databases by using @code{SHOW TABLES} and
similar commands.
@item
Fixed a stack problem on UnixWare/OpenUnix.
@item
Fixed a configuration problem on UnixWare/OpenUNIX and OpenServer.
@item
Fixed a stack overflow problem in password verification.
@item
Fixed a problem with @code{max_user_connections}.
@item
@code{HANDLER} without an index now works properly when a table has deleted 
rows. (Bug #787)
@item
Fixed a bug with @code{LOAD DATA} in @code{mysqlbinlog}. (Bug #670)
@item
Fixed that @code{SET CHARACTER SET DEFAULT} works. (Bug #462)
@item
Fixed @code{MERGE} table behavior in @code{ORDER BY ... DESC} queries.
(Bug #515)
@item
Fixed server crash on @code{PURGE MASTER LOGS} or @code{SHOW MASTER LOGS}
when the binary log is off. (Bug #733)
@item
Fixed password-checking problem on Windows. (Bug #464)
@item
Fixed the bug in comparison of a @code{DATETIME} column and an integer
constant.  (Bug #504)
@item
Fixed remote mode of @code{mysqlbinlog}. (Bug #672)
@item
Fixed @code{ERROR 1105: Unknown error} that occurred for some @code{SELECT}
queries, where a column that was declared as @code{NOT NULL} was compared
with an expression that took @code{NULL} value.
@item
Changed timeout in @code{mysql_real_connect()} to use @code{poll()} instead of
@code{select()} to work around problem with many open files in the client.
@item
Fixed incorrect results from @code{MATCH ... AGAINST} used with a
@code{LEFT JOIN} query.
@item
Fixed a bug that limited the maximum value for @code{mysqld} variables
to 4294967295 when they are specified on the command line.
@item
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused spurious ``Access denied'' errors
in @code{HANDLER ... READ} statements, when a table is referenced
via an alias.
@item
Fixed portability problem with @code{safe_malloc}, which caused MySQL to
give "Freeing wrong aligned pointer" errors on SCO 3.2.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE/DISABLE KEYS} could cause a core dump when
done after an @code{INSERT DELAYED} statement on the same table.
@item
Fixed problem with conversion of localtime to GMT where some times resulted in
different (but correct) timestamps. Now MySQL should use the smallest
possible timestamp value in this case.  (Bug #316)
@item
Very small query cache sizes could crash @code{mysqld}. (Bug #549)
@item
Fixed a bug (accidentally introduced by us but present only in version 4.0.13)
that made @code{INSERT ... SELECT} into an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column
not replicate well. This bug is in the master, not in the slave.
(Bug #490)
@item
Fixed a bug: When an @code{INSERT ... SELECT} statement inserted rows into a
non-transactional table, but failed at some point (for example, due to
a ``Duplicate key'' error), the query was not written to the binary log.
Now it is written to the binary log, with its error code, as all other
queries are. About the @code{slave-skip-errors} option for how to
handle partially completed queries in the slave, see @ref{Replication
Options}. (Bug #491)
@item
@code{SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0} was not replicated properly.
The fix probably will not be backported to 3.23.
@item
On a slave, @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} which had no @code{IGNORE} or
@code{REPLACE} clause on the master, was replicated with @code{IGNORE}.
While this is not a problem if the master and slave data are identical
(a @code{LOAD} that produces no duplicate conflicts on the master will
produce none on the slave anyway), which is true in normal operation, it
is better for debugging not to silently add the @code{IGNORE}. That way,
you can get an error message on the slave and discover that for some
reason, the data on master and slave are different and investigate why.
(Bug #571)
@item
On a slave, @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} printed an incomplete ``Duplicate entry
'%-.64s' for key %d''' message (the key name and value were not mentioned)
in case of duplicate conflict (which does not happen in normal operation).
(Bug #573)
@item
When using a slave compiled with @code{--debug}, @code{CHANGE MASTER
TO RELAY_LOG_POS} could cause a debug assertion failure. (Bug #576)
@item
When doing a @code{LOCK TABLES WRITE} on an @code{InnoDB} table, commit could
not happen, if the query was not written to the binary log (for example, if
@code{--log-bin} was not used, or @code{binlog-ignore-db} was
used). (Bug #578)
@item
If a 3.23 master had open
temporary tables that had been replicated to a 4.0 slave, and
the binary log got rotated, these temporary tables were immediately 
dropped by the slave (which caused problems if the master used them
subsequently). This bug had been fixed in 4.0.13, but in a manner
which caused an unlikely inconvenience: If the 3.23 master died
brutally (power failure), without having enough time to automatically
write @code{DROP TABLE} statements to its binary log, then the 4.0.13
slave would not notice the temporary tables have to be dropped, until the
slave @code{mysqld} server is restarted. This minor inconvenience is
fixed in 3.23.57 and 4.0.14 (meaning the master must be upgraded to
3.23.57 and the slave to 4.0.14 to remove the inconvenience). (Bug #254)
@item
If @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} was waiting, and the slave was idle, and
the slave SQL thread terminated, @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} would wait
forever. Now when the slave SQL thread terminates,
@code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} immediately returns @code{NULL} (``slave
stopped''). (Bug #651)
@item
After @code{RESET SLAVE; START SLAVE;}, the @code{Relay_Log_Space} value
displayed by @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} was too big by four bytes. (Bug #763)
@item
If a query was ignored on the slave (because of
@code{replicate-ignore-table} and other similar rules), the slave
still checked if the query got the same error code (0, no error) as on
the master. So if the master had an error on the query (for example,
``Duplicate entry'' in a multiple-row insert), then the slave stopped
and warned that the error codes didn't match. (Bug #797)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.13 (16 May 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{PRIMARY KEY} now implies @code{NOT NULL}. (Bug #390)
@item
The Windows binary packages are now compiled with
@code{--enable-local-infile} to match the Unix build configuration.
@item
Removed timing of tests from @code{mysql-test-run}. @code{time} does not
accept all required parameters on many platforms (for example, QNX) and timing
the tests is not really required (it's not a benchmark anyway).
@item
@code{SHOW MASTER STATUS} and @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} required the
@code{SUPER} privilege; now they accept @code{REPLICATION CLIENT} as well.
(Bug #343)
@item 
Added multi-threaded @code{MyISAM} repair optimization and
@code{myisam_repair_threads} variable to enable it.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item 
Added @code{innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct} variable which controls amount of
dirty pages allowed in @code{InnoDB} buffer pool.
@item
@code{CURRENT_USER()} and @code{Access denied} error messages now report the
hostname exactly as it was specified in the @code{GRANT} command.
@item
Removed benchmark results from the source and binary distributions. They
are still available in the BK source tree, though.
@item
@code{InnoDB} tables now support @code{ANALYZE TABLE}.
@item
MySQL now issues an error when it opens a table that was created with
MySQL 4.1.
@item
Option @code{--new} now changes binary items (@code{0xFFDF}) to be
treated as binary strings instead of numbers by default. This fixes some
problems with character sets where it's convenient to input the string
as a binary item.  After this change you have to convert the binary
string to @code{INTEGER} with a @code{CAST} if you want to compare two
binary items with each other and know which one is bigger than the other.
@code{SELECT CAST(0xfeff AS UNSIGNED) < CAST(0xff AS UNSIGNED)}.
This will be the default behavior in MySQL 4.1. (Bug #152)
@item
Enabled @code{delayed_insert_timeout} on Linux (most modern @code{glibc}
libraries have a fixed @code{pthread_cond_timedwait()}). (Bug #211)
@item
Don't create more insert delayed threads than given by
@code{max_delayed_threads}. (Bug #211)
@item
Changed @code{UPDATE ... LIMIT} to apply the limit to rows that were matched,
whether or not they actually were changed. Previously the limit was applied
as a restriction on the number of rows changed.
@item
Tuned optimizer to favor clustered index over table scan.
@item
@code{BIT_AND()} and @code{BIT_OR()} now return an unsigned 64-bit value.
@item
Added warnings to error log of why a secure connection failed (when
running with @code{--log-warnings}).
@item
Deprecated options @code{--skip-symlink} and @code{--use-symbolic-links} and
replaced these with @code{--symbolic-links}.
@item
The default option for @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit} was changed
from 0 to 1 to make @code{InnoDB} tables ACID by default.
@xref{InnoDB start, , @code{InnoDB} start}.
@item
Added a feature to @code{SHOW KEYS} to display keys that are disabled by 
@code{ALTER TABLE DISABLE KEYS} command.
@item
When using a non-existing table type with @code{CREATE TABLE}, first
try if the default table type exists before falling back to @code{MyISAM}.
@item
Added @code{MEMORY} as an alias for @code{HEAP}.
@item
Renamed function @code{rnd} to @code{my_rnd} as the name was too generic
and is an exported symbol in @code{libmysqlclient} (thanks to Dennis Haney
for the initial patch).
@item
Portability fix: renamed @file{include/dbug.h} to
@file{include/my_debug.h}.
@item
@code{mysqldump} no longer silently deletes the binary logs when invoked with
the @code{--master-data} or @code{--first-slave} option;
while this behavior was convenient for some
users, others may suffer from it. Now you must explicitly ask for binary
logs to be deleted by using the new @code{--delete-master-logs} option.
@item
If the slave is configured (using for example
@code{replicate-wild-ignore-table=mysql.%})
to exclude @code{mysql.user}, @code{mysql.host}, @code{mysql.db},
@code{mysql.tables_priv} and @code{mysql.columns_priv} from
replication, then @code{GRANT} and @code{REVOKE} will not be replicated.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Logged @code{Access denied} error message had incorrect @code{Using password}
value. (Bug #398)
@item
Fixed bug with @code{NATURAL LEFT JOIN}, @code{NATURAL RIGHT JOIN} and
@code{RIGHT JOIN} when using many joined tables.  The problem was that
the @code{JOIN} method was not always associated with the tables
surrounding the @code{JOIN} method.  If you have a query that uses many
@code{RIGHT JOIN} or @code{NATURAL ... JOINS} you should verify that they
work as you expected after upgrading MySQL to this version. (Bug #291)
@item
Fixed @code{mysql} parser not to erroneously interpret @samp{'} or @samp{"}
characters within @code{/* ... */} comment as beginning a quoted string.
@item
@code{mysql} command line client no longer looks for @code{\*} commands
inside backtick-quoted strings.
@item
Fixed @code{Unknown error} when using @code{UPDATE ... LIMIT}. (Bug #373)
@item
Fixed problem with ANSI mode and @code{GROUP BY} with constants. (Bug #387)
@item
Fixed bug with @code{UNION} and @code{OUTER JOIN}. (Bug #386)
@item
Fixed bug if one used a multiple-table @code{UPDATE} and the query required a
temporary table bigger than @code{tmp_table_size}. (Bug #286)
@item
Run @code{mysql_install_db} with the @code{-IN-RPM} option for the Mac OS X
installation to not fail on systems with improperly configured hostname
configurations.
@item
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} will now read @code{000000} as a zero date instead as
@code{"2000-00-00"}.
@item
Fixed bug that caused @code{DELETE FROM table WHERE const_expression}
always to delete the whole table (even if expression result was false).
(Bug #355)
@item
Fixed core dump bug when using @code{FORMAT('nan',#)}. (Bug #284)
@item
Fixed name resolution bug with @code{HAVING ... COUNT(DISTINCT ...)}.
@item
Fixed incorrect result from truncation operator (@code{*}) in
@code{MATCH ... AGAINST()} in some complex joins.
@item
Fixed a crash in @code{REPAIR ... USE_FRM} command, when used on read-only,
nonexisting table or a table with a crashed index file.
@item
Fixed a crashing bug in @code{mysql} monitor program.  It occurred if
program was started with @code{--no-defaults}, with a prompt that contained
the hostname and a connection to a non-existent database was requested.
@item
Fixed problem when comparing a key for a multi-byte character set. (Bug #152)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{LEFT}, @code{RIGHT} and @code{MID} when used with
multi-byte character sets and some @code{GROUP BY} queries. (Bug #314)
@item
Fix problem with @code{ORDER BY} being discarded for some
@code{DISTINCT} queries. (Bug #275)
@item
Fixed that @code{SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1} works as documented (This corrects
a new bug introduced in 4.0)
@item
Fixed some serious bugs in @code{UPDATE ... ORDER BY}. (Bug #241)
@item
Fixed unlikely problem in optimizing @code{WHERE} clause with constant
expression like in @code{WHERE 1 AND (a=1 AND b=1)}.
@item
Fixed that @code{SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1} works again.
@item
Introduced proper backtick quoting for db.table in @code{SHOW GRANTS}.
@item
@code{FULLTEXT} index stopped working after @code{ALTER TABLE}
that converts @code{TEXT} column to @code{CHAR}. (Bug #283)
@item
Fixed a security problem with @code{SELECT} and wildcarded select list,
when user only had partial column @code{SELECT} privileges on the table.
@item
Mark a @code{MyISAM} table as "analyzed" only when all the keys are indeed
analyzed.
@item
Only ignore world-writable @file{my.cnf} files that are regular files
(and not, for example, named pipes or character devices).
@item
Fixed few smaller issues with @code{SET PASSWORD}.
@item
Fixed error message which contained deprecated text.
@item
Fixed a bug with two @code{NATURAL JOIN}s in the query.
@item
@code{SUM()} didn't return @code{NULL} when there was no rows in result
or when all values was @code{NULL}.
@item
On Unix symbolic links handling was not enabled by default and there was
no way to turn this on.
@item
Added missing dashes to parameter @code{--open-files-limit} in
@code{mysqld_safe}. (Bug #264)
@item
Fixed incorrect hostname for TCP/IP connections displayed in
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}.
@item
Fixed a bug with @code{NAN} in @code{FORMAT(...)} function ...
@item 
Fixed a bug with improperly cached database privileges.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{ALTER TABLE ENABLE / DISABLE KEYS} which failed to
force a refresh of table data in the cache.
@item 
Fixed bugs in replication of @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} for custom parameters 
(@code{ENCLOSED},  @code{TERMINATED} and so on) and temporary tables.
(Bug #183, Bug #222)
@item
Fixed a replication bug when the master is 3.23 and the slave 4.0: the
slave lost the replicated temporary tables if @code{FLUSH LOGS} was
issued on the master. (Bug #254)
@item
Fixed a bug when doing @code{LOAD DATA INFILE IGNORE}: When reading
the binary log, @code{mysqlbinlog} and the replication code read @code{REPLACE}
instead of @code{IGNORE}. This could make the slave's table
become different from the master's table. (Bug #218)
@item
Fixed a deadlock when @code{relay_log_space_limit} was set to a too
small value. (Bug #79)
@item
Fixed a bug in HAVING clause when an alias is used from the
@strong{select list}. 
@item
Fixed overflow bug in @code{MyISAM} when a row is inserted into a table with a 
large number of columns and at least one @code{BLOB/TEXT} column. Bug was caused
by incorrect calculation of the needed buffer to pack data.
@item
Fixed a bug when @code{SELECT} @strong{@@nonexistent_variable} caused the
error in client - server protocol due to net_printf() being sent to
the client twice.
@item 
Fixed a bug in setting @code{SQL_BIG_SELECTS} option.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} which only displayed a localhost
in the @code{"Host"} column. This was caused by a glitch that used only
current thread information instead of information from the linked list of threads.
@item
Removed unnecessary Mac OS X helper files from server RPM. (Bug #144)
@item
Allow optimization of multiple-table update for @code{InnoDB} tables as well.
@item
Fixed a bug in multiple-table updates that caused some rows to be
updated several times.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{mysqldump} when it was called with
@code{--master-data}: the @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} commands appended to
the SQL dump had incorrect coordinates. (Bug #159)
@item
Fixed a bug when an updating query using @code{USER()} was replicated
on the slave; this caused segfault on the slave. (Bug #178).
@code{USER()} is still badly replicated on the slave (it is
replicated to @code{""}).

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.12 (15 Mar 2003: Production)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{mysqld} no longer reads options from world-writable config files.
@item
Integer values between 9223372036854775807 and 9999999999999999999 are now
regarded as unsigned longlongs, not as floats. This makes these values work
similar to values between 10000000000000000000 and 18446744073709551615.
@item
@code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} will now include the client TCP port after the
hostname to make it easier to know from which client the request
originated.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed @code{mysqld} crash on extremely small values of
@code{sort_buffer} variable.
@item
@code{INSERT INTO u SELECT ... FROM t} was written too late to the
binary log if t was very frequently updated during the execution of 
this query. This could cause a problem with @code{mysqlbinlog} or
replication. The master must be upgraded, not the slave. (Bug #136)
@item
Fixed checking of random part of @code{WHERE} clause. (Bug #142)
@item
Fixed a bug with multiple-table updates with @code{InnoDB}
tables. This bug occurred as, in many cases, @code{InnoDB} tables cannot
be updated ``on the fly,'' but offsets to the records have to be stored in
a temporary table. 
@item
Added missing file @code{mysql_secure_installation} to the @code{server}
RPM subpackage. (Bug #141)
@item
Fixed MySQL (and @code{myisamchk}) crash on artificially
corrupted @code{.MYI} files.
@item
Don't allow @code{BACKUP TABLE} to overwrite existing files.
@item
Fixed a bug with multiple-table @code{UPDATE} statements when user had all privileges
on the database where tables are located and there were any entries in
@code{tables_priv} table, that is, @code{grant_option} was true.
@item
Fixed a bug that allowed a user with table or column grants on some table,
@code{TRUNCATE} any table in the same database.
@item
Fixed deadlock when doing @code{LOCK TABLE} followed by @code{DROP
TABLE} in the same thread.  In this case one could still kill the thread
with @code{KILL}.
@item
@code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} was not properly written to the binary
log (hence not properly replicated). (Bug #82)
@item
@code{RAND()} entries were not read correctly by @code{mysqlbinlog} from
the binary log which caused problems when restoring a table that was
inserted with @code{RAND()}. @code{INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(RAND())}. In
replication this worked ok.
@item
@code{SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0} was ignored for @code{INSERT DELAYED}
queries. (Bug #104)
@item
@code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS} reported too old positions
(columns @code{Relay_Master_Log_File} and @code{Exec_Master_Log_Pos})
for the last executed statement from the master, if this statement
was the @code{COMMIT} of a transaction. The master must be upgraded for that,
not the slave. (Bug #52)
@item
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} was not replicated by the slave if
@code{replicate_*_table} was set on the slave. (Bug #86)
@item
After @code{RESET SLAVE}, the coordinates displayed by @code{SHOW
SLAVE STATUS} looked un-reset (although they were, but only
internally). (Bug #70)
@item
Fixed query cache invalidation on @code{LOAD DATA}.
@item
Fixed memory leak on @code{ANALYZE} procedure with error.
@item
Fixed a bug in handling @code{CHAR(0)} columns that could cause incorrect
results from the query.
@item
Fixed rare bug with incorrect initialization of @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column,
as a secondary column in a multi-column key (@pxref{example-AUTO_INCREMENT,
, @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} on secondary column  in a multi-column key}), when
data was inserted with @code{INSERT ... SELECT} or @code{LOAD DATA} into
an empty table.
@item
On Windows, @code{STOP SLAVE} didn't stop the slave until the slave
got one new command from the master (this bug has been fixed for MySQL 4.0.11
by releasing updated 4.0.11a Windows packages, which include this individual
fix on top of the 4.0.11 sources). (Bug #69)
@item 
Fixed a crash when no database was selected and @code{LOAD DATA} command
was issued with full table name specified, including database prefix.
@item
Fixed a crash when shutting down replication on some platforms
(for example, Mac OS X).
@item
Fixed a portability bug with @code{pthread_attr_getstacksize} on
HP-UX 10.20 (Patch was also included in 4.0.11a sources).
@item
Fixed the @code{bigint} test to not fail on some platforms (for example, HP-UX and
Tru64) due to different return values of the @code{atof()} function.
@item
Fixed the @code{rpl_rotate_logs} test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed @code{slave-master-info.opt}
to @code{.slave-mi}).

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{NULL} is now sorted @strong{LAST} if you use @code{ORDER BY ... DESC}
(as it was before MySQL 4.0.2).  This change was required to comply
with the SQL standard.  (The original change was made because we thought
that standard SQL required @code{NULL} to be always sorted at the same position,
but this was incorrect).
@item
Added @code{START TRANSACTION} (standard SQL syntax) as alias for @code{BEGIN}.
This is recommended to use instead of @code{BEGIN} to start a transaction.
@item
Added @code{OLD_PASSWORD()} as a synonym for @code{PASSWORD()}.
@item
Allow keyword @code{ALL} in group functions.
@item
Added support for some new @code{INNER JOIN} and @code{JOIN} syntaxes.
For example, @code{SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2} didn't work before.
@item
Novell NetWare 6.0 porting effort completed, Novell patches merged into
the main source tree.

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed problem with multiple-table delete and @code{InnoDB} tables.
@item
Fixed a problem with @code{BLOB NOT NULL} columns used with @code{IS NULL}.
@item
Re-added missing pre- and post(un)install scripts to the Linux RPM packages
(they were missing after the renaming of the server subpackage).
@item
Fixed that table locks are not released with multiple-table updates and 
deletes with @code{InnoDB} storage engine.
@item
Fixed bug in updating @code{BLOB} columns with long strings.
@item
Fixed integer-wraparound when giving big integer (>= 10 digits) to
function that requires an unsigned argument, like @code{CREATE TABLE (...) 
AUTO_INCREMENT=#}.
@item
@code{MIN(key_column)} could in some cases return @code{NULL} on a column
with @code{NULL} and other values.
@item
@code{MIN(key_column)} and @code{MAX(key_column)} could in some cases
return incorrect values when used in @code{OUTER JOIN}.
@item
@code{MIN(key_column)} and @code{MAX(key_column)} could return incorrect
values if one of the tables was empty.
@item
Fixed rare crash in compressed @code{MyISAM} tables with blobs.
@item
Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for @code{INTERVAL},
@code{CASE}, @code{FIELD}, @code{CONCAT_WS}, @code{ELT} and
@code{MAKE_SET} functions.
@item
When running with @code{--lower-case-table-names} (default on Windows)
and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
executing @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} followed with @code{DROP DATABASE}
or @code{DROP TABLE} could fail with @code{Errcode 13}.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.10 (29 Jan 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Added option @code{--log-error[=file_name]} to @code{mysqld_safe} and
@code{mysqld}. This option will force all error messages to be put in a
log file if the option @code{--console} is not given. On Windows
@code{--log-error} is enabled as default, with a default name of
@code{host_name.err} if the name is not specified.
@item
Changed some things from @code{Warning:} to @code{Note:} in the log files.
@item
The @code{mysqld} server should now compile on NetWare.
@item
Added optimization that if one does @code{GROUP BY ... ORDER BY NULL}
then result is not sorted.
@item
New @code{--ft-stopword-file} command-line option for @code{mysqld} to
replace/disable the built-in stopword list that is used in full-text searches.
@xref{Server system variables}.
@item
Changed default stack size from 64KB to 192KB; This fixes a core dump
problem on Red Hat 8.0 and other systems with a @code{glibc} that requires a
stack size larger than 128K
for @code{gethostbyaddr()} to resolve a hostname. You can fix
this for earlier MySQL versions by starting @code{mysqld} with
@code{--thread-stack=192K}.
@item
Added @code{mysql_waitpid} to the binary distribution and the
@code{MySQL-client} RPM subpackage (required for @code{mysql-test-run}).
@item
Renamed the main @code{MySQL} RPM package to @code{MySQL-server}. When
updating from an older version, @code{MySQL-server.rpm} will simply replace
@code{MySQL.rpm}.
@item
If a slave is configured with @code{replicate_wild_do_table=db.%} or
@code{replicate_wild_ignore_table=db.%}, these rules will be applied to
@code{CREATE/DROP DATABASE}, too.
@item
Added timeout value for @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()}.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed initialization of the random seed for newly created threads to
give a better @code{rand()} distribution from the first call.
@item
Fixed a bug that caused @code{mysqld} to hang when a
table was opened with the @code{HANDLER} command and then
dropped without being closed.
@item
Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a query
that inserts a @code{NULL} in an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column and also
uses @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}.
@item
Fixed an unlikely bug that could cause a memory overrun when using
@code{ORDER BY constant_expression}.
@item
Fixed a table corruption in @code{myisamchk} parallel repair mode.
@item
Fixed bug in query cache invalidation on simple table renaming.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{mysqladmin --relative}.
@item
On some 64-bit systems, @code{show status} reported a strange number for
@code{Open_files} and @code{Open_streams}.
@item
Fixed incorrect number of columns in @code{EXPLAIN} on empty table.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{LEFT JOIN} that caused zero rows to be returned in
the case the @code{WHERE} condition was evaluated as @code{FALSE} after
reading @code{const} tables. (Unlikely condition).
@item
@code{FLUSH PRIVILEGES} didn't correctly flush table/column privileges
when @code{mysql.tables_priv} is empty.
@item
Fixed bug in replication when using @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} one a file
that updated an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column with @code{NULL} or @code{0}. This
bug only affected MySQL 4.0 masters (not slaves or MySQL 3.23 masters).
@strong{Note:} If you have a slave that has replicated a file with
generated @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns then the slave data is corrupted and you
should reinitialize the affected tables from the master.
@item
Fixed possible memory overrun when sending a @code{BLOB} value larger than 16M
to the client.
@item
Fixed incorrect error message when setting a @code{NOT NULL} column to an
expression that returned @code{NULL}.
@item
Fixed core dump bug in @code{str LIKE "%other_str%"} where @code{str} or
@code{other_str} contained characters >= 128.
@item
Fixed bug: When executing on master @code{LOAD DATA} and @code{InnoDB} failed
with @code{table full} error the binary log was corrupted.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.9 (09 Jan 2003)

Functionality added or changed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} will for @code{MyISAM} tables treat all @code{NULL}
values as different when calculating cardinality.  This helps in
optimizing joins between tables where one of the tables has a lot of
@code{NULL} values in a indexed column:
@example
SELECT * from t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.key_with_a_lot_of_null;
@end example
@item
Added join operator @code{FORCE INDEX (key_list)}. This acts likes
@code{USE INDEX (key_list)} but with the addition that a table scan is
assumed to be VERY expensive.  One bad thing with this is that it makes
@code{FORCE} a reserved word.
@item
Reset internal row buffer in @code{MyISAM} after each query. This will reduce
memory in the case you have a lot of big blobs in a table.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
A security patch in 4.0.8 causes the @code{mysqld} server to die if the remote
hostname can't be resolved. This is now fixed.
@item
Fixed crash when replication big @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} statement that
caused log rotation.

Default @code{max_packet_length} for libmysqld.c is now 1024*1024*1024.
@item
One can now specify @code{max_allowed_packet} in a file read by
@code{mysql_options(MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE)}.
for clients.
@item
When sending a too big packet to the server with the not compressed
protocol, the client now gets an error message instead of a lost
connection.
@item
We now send big queries/result rows in bigger hunks, which should give a
small speed improvement.
@item
Fixed some bugs with the compressed protocol for rows > 16MB.
@item
@code{InnoDB} tables now also support @code{ON UPDATE CASCADE} in
@code{FOREIGN KEY} constraints. See the @code{InnoDB} section in the manual
for the @code{InnoDB} changelog.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE} with @code{BDB} tables.
@item
Fixed core dump bug in @code{QUOTE()} function.
@item
Fixed a bug in handling communication packets bigger than
16MB. Unfortunately this required a protocol change; If you upgrade the
server to 4.0.8 and above and have clients that uses packets >=
255*255*255 bytes (=16581375) you must also upgrade your clients to at
least 4.0.8.  If you don't upgrade, the clients will hang when sending a
big packet.
@item
Fixed bug when sending blobs longer than 16MB to client.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{GROUP BY} when used on BLOB column with @code{NULL} values.
@item
Fixed a bug in handling @code{NULL} values in @code{CASE} ... WHEN ...

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.6 (14 Dec 2002: Gamma)

Functionality added or changed:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Added syntax support for @code{CHARACTER SET xxx} and @code{CHARSET=xxx}
table options (to be able to read table dumps from 4.1).
@item
Fixed replication bug that caused the slave to loose its position in
some cases when the replication log was rotated.
@item
Fixed that a slave will restart from the start of a transaction if
it's killed in the middle of one.
@item
Moved the manual pages from @file{man} to @file{man/man1} in the
binary distributions.
@item
The default type returned by @code{IFNULL(A,B)} is now set to be the
more 'general' of the types of @code{A} and @code{B}. (The order is
@code{STRING}, @code{REAL} or @code{INTEGER}).
@item
Moved the @code{mysql.server} startup script in the RPM packages from
@file{/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql} to @file{/etc/init.d/mysql}
(which almost all current Linux distributions support for LSB compliance).
@item
Added @code{Qcache_lowmem_prunes} status variable (number of queries that were
deleted from cache because of low memory).
@item
Fixed @code{mysqlcheck} so it can deal with table names containing dashes.
@item
Bulk insert optimization
(@pxref{Server system variables, ,@code{bulk_insert_buffer_size}})
is no longer used when inserting small (less than 100) number of rows.
@item
Optimization added for queries like
@code{SELECT ... FROM merge_table WHERE indexed_column=constant_expr}.
@item
Added functions @code{LOCALTIME} and @code{LOCALTIMESTAMP} as synonyms for
@code{NOW()}.
@item
@code{CEIL} is now an alias for @code{CEILING}.
@item
The @code{CURRENT_USER()} function can be used to get a @code{user@@host}
value as it was matched in the @code{GRANT} system.
@xref{Information functions, ,@code{CURRENT_USER()}}.
@item
Fixed @code{CHECK} constraints to be compatible with standard SQL. This made
@code{CHECK} a reserved word. (Checking of @code{CHECK} constraints is
still not implemented).
@item
Added @code{CAST(... as CHAR)}.
@item
Added PostgreSQL compatible @code{LIMIT} syntax:
@code{SELECT ... LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset}
@item
@code{mysql_change_user()} will now reset the connection to the state
of a fresh connect (Ie, @code{ROLLBACK} any active transaction, close
all temporary tables, reset all user variables etc..)
@item
@code{CHANGE MASTER} and @code{RESET SLAVE} now require that slave
threads be both already stopped; these commands will return an error
if at least one of these two threads is running.
@end itemize

Bugs fixed:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed number of found rows returned in @code{multi table updates}
@item
Make @code{--lower-case-table-names} default on Mac OS X as the default
filesystem (HFS+) is case insensitive.
@xref{Name case sensitivity}.
@item
Transactions in @code{AUTOCOMMIT=0} mode didn't rotate binary log.
@item
A fix for the bug in a @code{SELECT} with joined tables with
@code{ORDER BY} and @code{LIMIT} clause when filesort had to be used.
In that case @code{LIMIT} was applied to filesort of one of the tables,
although it could not be.
This fix also solved problems with @code{LEFT JOIN}.
@item
@code{mysql_server_init()} now makes a copy of all arguments. This fixes
a problem when using the embedded server in C# program.
@item
Fixed buffer overrun in @code{libmysqlclient} library
that allowed a malicious MySQL server to crash the client
application.
@item
Fixed security-related bug in @code{mysql_change_user()} handling.
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.6.

@code{--replicate-do=xxx} didn't work for @code{UPDATE} commands.
(Bug introduced in 4.0.0)
@item
Fixed shutdown problem on Mac OS X.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 4.0.5 (13 Nov 2002)

Functionality added or changed:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Port number was added to hostname (if it is known) in @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}
command
@item
Changed handling of last argument in @code{WEEK()} so that you can get
week number according to the ISO 8601 specification.
(Old code should still work).
@item
Fixed that @code{INSERT DELAYED} threads don't hang on @code{Waiting for
INSERT} when one sends a @code{SIGHUP} to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Change that @code{AND} works according to standard SQL when it comes to
@code{NULL} handling. In practice, this affects only queries where you
do something like @code{WHERE ... NOT (NULL AND 0)}.
@item
@code{mysqld} will now resolve @code{basedir} to its full path (with
@code{realpath()}). This enables one to use relative symlinks to the
MySQL installation directory.  This will however cause @code{show
variables} to report different directories on systems where there is
a symbolic link in the path.
@item
Fixed that MySQL will not use index scan on index disabled with
@code{IGNORE INDEX} or @code{USE INDEX}.
to be ignored.
@item
Added @code{--use-frm} option to @code{mysqlcheck}. When used with
@code{REPAIR}, it gets the table structure from the @code{.frm} file, so the
table can be repaired even if the @code{.MYI} header is corrupted.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MAX()} optimization when used with @code{JOIN} and
@code{ON} expressions.
@item
Added support for reading of MySQL 4.1 table definition files.
@item
@code{BETWEEN} behavior changed (@pxref{Comparison Operators}).
Now @code{datetime_col BETWEEN timestamp AND timestamp} should work
as expected.
@item
One can create @code{TEMPORARY} @code{MERGE} tables now.
@item
@code{DELETE FROM myisam_table} now shrinks not only the @file{.MYD} file but
also the @file{.MYI} file.
@item
When one uses the @code{--open-files-limit=#} option to @code{mysqld_safe}
it's now passed on to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Changed output from @code{EXPLAIN} from @code{'where used'} to
@code{'Using where'} to make it more in line with other output.
@item
Removed variable @code{safe_show_database} as it was no longer used.
@item
Updated source tree to be built using @code{automake 1.5} and 
@code{libtool 1.4}.
@item
Fixed an inadvertently changed option (@code{--ignore-space}) back to the
original @code{--ignore-spaces} in @code{mysqlclient}. (Both syntaxes will
work).
@item
Don't require @code{UPDATE} privilege when using @code{REPLACE}.
@item
Added support for @code{DROP TEMPORARY TABLE ...}, to be used to make
replication safer.
@item
When transactions are enabled, all commands that update temporary tables
inside a @code{BEGIN/COMMIT} are now stored in the binary log on
@code{COMMIT} and not stored if one does @code{ROLLBACK}.  This fixes
some problems with non-transactional temporary tables used inside
transactions.
@item
Allow braces in joins in all positions. Formerly, things like
@code{SELECT * FROM (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a)), t1} worked, but
not @code{SELECT * FROM t1, (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a))}. Note that
braces are simply removed, they do not change the way the join is
executed.
@item
@code{InnoDB} now supports also isolation levels
@code{READ UNCOMMITTED} and @code{READ COMMITTED}.
For a detailed @code{InnoDB} changelog, see @ref{InnoDB change history}
in this manual.

@item
Fixed a bug that limited @code{MyISAM} key length to a value
slightly less that 500. It is exactly 500 now.
@item
Fixed that @code{GROUP BY} on columns that may have a @code{NULL} value
doesn't always use disk based temporary tables.
@item
The filename argument for the @code{--des-key-file} argument to @code{mysqld}
is interpreted relative to the data directory if given as a relative pathname.
@item
Removed a condition that temp table with index on column that can be
@code{NULL} has to be @code{MyISAM}. This was okay for 3.23, but not
needed in 4.*. This resulted in slowdown in many queries since 4.0.2.
@item
Small code improvement in multiple-table updates.
@item
Fixed a newly introduced bug that caused @code{ORDER BY ... LIMIT row_count}
to not return all rows.
@item
Fixed a bug in multiple-table deletes when outer join is used on an empty
table, which gets first to be deleted.
@item
Fixed a bug in multiple-table updates when a single table is updated.
@item
Fixed bug that caused @code{REPAIR TABLE} and @code{myisamchk}

Fixed bug with caching the @code{mysql} grant table database. Now queries
in this database are not cached in the query cache.
@item
Small fix in @code{mysqld_safe} for some shells.

even if one is using other SSL options in an option file or previously
on the command line.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MATCH ... AGAINST( ... IN BOOLEAN MODE)}
used with @code{ORDER BY}.
@item
Added @code{LOCK TABLES} and @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES} privilege on
the database level.  You must run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables}
script on old installations to activate these.
@item
In @code{SHOW TABLE ... STATUS}, compressed tables sometimes showed up as
@code{dynamic}.
@item
@code{SELECT @@@@[global|session].var_name} didn't report
@code{global | session} in the result column name.
@item
Fixed problem in replication that @code{FLUSH LOGS} in a circular
replication setup created an infinite number of binary log files.

@code{GRANT ... REQUIRE} didn't store the SSL information in the
@code{mysql.user} table if SSL was not enabled in the server.
@item
@code{GRANT ... REQUIRE NONE} can now be used to remove SSL information.
@item
@code{AND} is now optional between @code{REQUIRE} options.
@item
@code{REQUIRE} option was not properly saved, which could cause strange

@item
Fixed bug in query cache after temporary table creation.
@item
Added @code{--count=N} (@code{-c}) option to @code{mysqladmin}, to make the
program do only @code{N} iterations. To be used with @code{--sleep} (@code{-i}).

cryptographically more secure equivalent of @code{MD5()}.
@xref{Encryption functions}.
@item
Added @code{AES_ENCRYPT()} and @code{AES_DECRYPT()} functions to perform
encryption according to AES standard (Rijndael).

Added privileges @code{CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES}, @code{EXECUTE},
@code{LOCK TABLES}, @code{REPLICATION CLIENT}, @code{REPLICATION SLAVE},
@code{SHOW DATABASES} and @code{SUPER}. To use these, you must have
run the @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} script after upgrading.
@item

is too large (greater than the value corresponding to @code{255.255.255.255}).
@item
Fix @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} to work with @code{UNION}. It will work only
if the first @code{SELECT} has this option and if there is global @code{LIMIT}

individual @code{SELECT} queries within the statement.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS} and @code{LIMIT}.
@item
Don't give an error for @code{CREATE TABLE ...(... VARCHAR(0))}.

tables or an active transaction}.
@item
Added @code{NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION} to the set of flags that may be
specified with the @code{--sql-mode} option for @code{mysqld}.  It disables
unsigned arithmetic rules when it comes to subtraction. (This will make

Added @code{CAST()} and @code{CONVERT()} functions. The @code{CAST} and
@code{CONVERT} functions are nearly identical and mainly useful when you
want to create a column with a specific type in a @code{CREATE ... SELECT}
statement.  For more information, read @ref{Cast Functions}.

               MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR N2
               MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR N3;

@node News-3.23.x, News-3.22.x, News-4.0.x, News
@appendixsec Changes in release 3.23.x (Recent; still supported)

@cindex changes, version 3.23

Please note that since release 4.0 is now production level, only critical
fixes are done in the 3.23 release series. You are recommended to upgrade
when possible, to take advantage of all speed and feature improvements in
4.0. @xref{Upgrading-from-3.23}.

The 3.23 release has several major features that are not
present in previous versions.  We have added three new
table types:

@table @asis
@item @code{MyISAM}
A new @code{ISAM} library which is tuned for SQL and supports large files.
@item @code{InnoDB}
A transaction-safe storage engine that supports row level locking, and many
Oracle-like features.
@item @code{BerkeleyDB} or @code{BDB}
Uses the Berkeley DB library from Sleepycat Software to implement
transaction-safe tables.
@end table

Note that only @code{MyISAM} is available in the standard binary distribution.

The 3.23 release also includes support for database replication between
a master and many slaves, full-text indexing, and much more.

All new features are being developed in the 4.x version.  Only
bug fixes and minor enhancements to existing features will be
added to 3.23.

The replication code and BerkeleyDB code is still not as tested and as
the rest of the code, so we will probably need to do a couple of future
releases of 3.23 with small fixes for this part of the code. As long as
you don't use these features, you should be quite safe with
MySQL 3.23!

Note that the preceding remarks don't mean that replication or Berkeley DB don't
work.  We have done a lot of testing of all code, including replication
and @code{BDB} without finding any problems.  It only means that not as many
users use this code as the rest of the code and because of this we are
not yet 100% confident in this code.

@c NOTE: References to bug numbers should be written after the sentence
@c NOTE: describing the bugfix, like this:
@c NOTE: This sentence describes the fix. (Bug #nnnn)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a symlink vulnerability in @file{mysqlbug} script -
vulnerability id CAN-2004-0381. (Bug #3284)
@item
Fixed bug in privilege checking of @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME}. (Bug #3270)
@item
Fixed bugs in @code{ACOS()}, @code{ASIN()} (Bug #2338) 
and in @code{FLOOR()} (Bug #3051).
The cause of the problem is an overly strong optimization done by @code{gcc}
in this case.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{INSERT ... SELECT} statements where, if a @code{NOT NULL}
column is assigned a value of @code{NULL}, the following columns in the row
might be assigned a value of zero.  (Bug #2012)
@item
If a query was ignored on the slave (because of
@code{replicate-ignore-table} and other similar rules), the slave
still checked if the query got the same error code (0, no error) as on
the master. So if the master had an error on the query (for example,
``Duplicate entry'' in a multiple-row insert), then the slave stopped
and warned that the error codes didn't match. This is a backport of the
fix for MySQL 4.0. (Bug #797)
@item
@code{mysqlbinlog} now asks for a password at console when the
@code{-p/--password} option is used with no argument. This is how the
other clients (@code{mysqladmin}, @code{mysqldump}..) already
behave. Note that one now has to use @code{mysqlbinlog -p<my_password>};
@code{mysqlbinlog -p <my_password>} will not work anymore (in other
words, put no space after @code{-p}). (Bug #1595)
@item
On some 64-bit machines (some HP-UX and Solaris machines), a slave
installed with the 64-bit MySQL binary could not connect to its master
(it connected to itself instead). (Bug #1256, #1381)
@item
Fixed a Windows-specific bug present since MySQL 3.23.57 and
3.23.58 that caused Windows slaves to crash when they started
replication if a @file{master.info} file existed. (Bug #1720)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE RENAME}, when rename to the table with
the same name in another database silently dropped destination table if
it existed. (Bug #2628)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.58 (11 Sep 2003)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed buffer overflow in password handling which could potentially be
exploited by MySQL users with @code{ALTER} privilege on the
@code{mysql.user} table to execute random code or to gain shell access with
the UID of the @code{mysqld} process (thanks to Jedi/Sector One for spotting and
reporting this bug).
@item
@code{mysqldump} now correctly quotes all identifiers when communicating
with the server. This assures that during the dump process, @code{mysqldump}
will never send queries to the server that result in a syntax error. This
problem is @strong{not} related to the @code{mysqldump} program's output,
which was not changed. (Bug #1148)
@item
Fixed table/column grant handling - proper sort order (from most specific
to less specific, @pxref{Request access}) was not honored. (Bug #928)
@item
Fixed overflow bug in @code{MyISAM} and @code{ISAM} when a row is updated
in a table with a large number of columns and at least one @code{BLOB/TEXT}
column.
@item
Fixed MySQL so that field length (in C API) for the second column in
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} is always larger than the data length.
The only known application that was affected by the old behavior was
Borland dbExpress, which truncated the output from the command.
(Bug #1064)
@item
Fixed @code{ISAM} bug in @code{MAX()} optimization.
@item
Fixed @code{Unknown error} when doing @code{ORDER BY} on reference table which
was used with @code{NULL} value on @code{NOT NULL} column. (Bug #479)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.57 (06 Jun 2003)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed problem in alarm handling that could cause problems when getting a
packet that is too large.
@item
Fixed problem when installing MySQL as a service on Windows when two
arguments were specified to @code{mysqld} (option file group name and
service name).
@item
Fixed @code{kill pid-of-mysqld} to work on Mac OS X.
@item
@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} displayed incorrect @code{Row_format} value for
tables that have been compressed with @code{myisampack}.
(Bug #427)
@item
@code{SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_data_file_path'} displayed only the
name of the first data file. (Bug #468)
@item
Fixed security problem where @code{mysqld} didn't allow one to @code{UPDATE}
rows in a table even if one had a global @code{UPDATE} privilege and a
database @code{SELECT} privilege.
@item
Fixed a security problem with @code{SELECT} and wildcarded select list,
when user only had partial column @code{SELECT} privileges on the table.
@item
Fixed unlikely problem in optimizing @code{WHERE} clause with a constant
expression such as in @code{WHERE 1 AND (a=1 AND b=1)}.
@item
Fixed problem on IA-64 with timestamps that caused @code{mysqlbinlog} to fail.
@item
The default option for @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit} was changed
from 0 to 1 to make @code{InnoDB} tables ACID by default.
@xref{InnoDB start, , @code{InnoDB} start}.
@item
Fixed problem with too many allocated alarms on slave when connecting to
master many times (normally not a very critical error).
@item
Fixed a bug in replication of temporary tables. (Bug #183)
@item
Fixed 64-bit bug that affected at least AMD hammer systems.
@item
Fixed a bug when doing @code{LOAD DATA INFILE IGNORE}: When reading
the binary log, @code{mysqlbinlog} and the replication code read @code{REPLACE}
instead of @code{IGNORE}. This could make the slave's table
become different from the master's table. (Bug #218)
@item
Fixed overflow bug in @code{MyISAM} when a row is inserted into a table with a 
large number of columns and at least one @code{BLOB/TEXT} column. Bug was caused
by incorrect calculation of the needed buffer to pack data.
@item
The binary log was not locked during @code{TRUNCATE tbl_name} or
@code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} statements, which could cause an @code{INSERT} to
@code{tbl_name} to be written to the log before the
@code{TRUNCATE} or @code{DELETE} statements.
@item
Fixed rare bug in @code{UPDATE} of @code{InnoDB} tables where one row could be
updated multiple times.
@item
Produce an error for empty table and column names.
@item
Changed @code{PROCEDURE ANALYSE()} to report @code{DATE} instead of
@code{NEWDATE}.
@item
Changed @code{PROCEDURE ANALYSE(#)} to restrict the number of values in an
@code{ENUM} column to @code{#} also for string values.
@item
@code{mysqldump} no longer silently deletes the binary logs when invoked with
the @code{--master-data} or @code{--first-slave} option;
while this behavior was convenient for some
users, others may suffer from it. Now you must explicitly ask for binary
logs to be deleted by using the new @code{--delete-master-logs} option.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{mysqldump} when it was invoked with the
@code{--master-data} option: The @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statements that were
appended to the SQL dump had incorrect coordinates. (Bug #159)

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.56 (13 Mar 2003)
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed @code{mysqld} crash on extremely small values of
@code{sort_buffer} variable.
@item
Fixed a bug in privilege system for @code{GRANT UPDATE} on the column level.
@item
Fixed a rare bug when using a date in @code{HAVING} with @code{GROUP BY}.
@item
Fixed checking of random part of @code{WHERE} clause. (Bug #142)
@item
Fixed MySQL (and @code{myisamchk}) crash on artificially
corrupted @file{.MYI} files.
@item
Security enhancement:
@code{mysqld} no longer reads options from world-writable config files.
@item
Security enhancement:
@code{mysqld} and @code{safe_mysqld} now use only the first @code{--user}
option specified on the command line. (Normally this comes from
@file{/etc/my.cnf})
@item
Security enhancement:
Don't allow @code{BACKUP TABLE} to overwrite existing files.
@item
Fixed unlikely deadlock bug when one thread did a @code{LOCK TABLE} and
another thread did a @code{DROP TABLE}.  In this case one could do
a @code{KILL} on one of the threads to resolve the deadlock.
@item
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} was not replicated by slave if
@code{replicate_*_table} was set on the slave.
@item
Fixed a bug in handling @code{CHAR(0)} columns that could cause incorrect
results from the query.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{SHOW VARIABLES} on 64-bit platforms. The bug was
caused by incorrect declaration of variable @code{server_id}.
@item
The Comment column in @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} now reports that it can
contain @code{NULL} values (which is the case for a crashed @file{.frm} file).
@item
Fixed the @code{rpl_rotate_logs} test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed @code{slave-master-info.opt}
to @code{.slave-mi}).
@item
Fixed a problem with @code{BLOB NOT NULL} columns used with @code{IS NULL}.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MAX()} optimization in @code{MERGE} tables.
@item
Better @code{RAND()} initialization for new connections.
@item
Fixed bug with connect timeout. This bug was manifested on OS's with 
@code{poll()} system call, which resulted in timeout the value specified as
it was executed in both @code{select()} and @code{poll()}.
@item
Fixed bug in
@code{SELECT * FROM table WHERE datetime1 IS NULL OR datetime2 IS NULL}.
@item
Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for @code{INTERVAL},
@code{CASE}, @code{FIELD}, @code{CONCAT_WS}, @code{ELT} and
@code{MAKE_SET} functions.
@item
When running with @code{--lower-case-table-names=1} (default on Windows)
and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
executing @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} followed with @code{DROP DATABASE}
or @code{DROP TABLE} could fail with @code{Errcode 13}.
@item
Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a query
that inserts a @code{NULL} in an @code{auto_increment} field and also
uses @code{LAST_INSERT_ID()}.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{mysqladmin --relative}.
@item
On some 64-bit systems, @code{show status} reported a strange number for
@code{Open_files} and @code{Open_streams}.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.55 (23 Jan 2003)
@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed double @code{free}'d pointer bug in @code{mysql_change_user()}
handling, that enabled a specially hacked version of MySQL client
to crash @code{mysqld}. @strong{Note} that you must log in to the server
by using a valid user account to be able to exploit this bug.
@item
Fixed bug with the @code{--slow-log} when logging an administrator command
(like @code{FLUSH TABLES}).
@item
Fixed bug in @code{GROUP BY} when used on BLOB column with @code{NULL} values.
@item
Fixed a bug in handling @code{NULL} values in @code{CASE ... WHEN ...}.
@item
Bugfix for @code{--chroot} (@pxref{News-3.23.54, @code{--chroot}})
is reverted. Unfortunately, there is no way to make it to work, without
introducing backward-incompatible changes in @file{my.cnf}.
Those who need @code{--chroot} functionality, should upgrade to MySQL 4.0.
(The fix in the 4.0 branch did not break backward-compatibility).
@item
Make @code{--lower-case-table-names} default on Mac OS X as the default
filesystem (HFS+) is case insensitive.
@item
Fixed a bug in @file{scripts/mysqld_safe.sh} in @code{NOHUP_NICENESS}
testing.
@item
Transactions in @code{AUTOCOMMIT=0} mode didn't rotate binary log.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{scripts/make_binary_distribution} that resulted in
a remaining @code{@@HOSTNAME@@} variable instead of replacing it with the
correct path to the @code{hostname} binary.
@item
Fixed a very unlikely bug that could cause @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST} to core
dump in pthread_mutex_unlock() if a new thread was connecting.
@item
Forbid @code{SLAVE STOP} if the thread executing the query has locked
tables.  This removes a possible deadlock situation.

the @file{.MRG} file. Instead, it deletes records from the mapped tables.
@item
Don't give warning for a statement that is only a comment; this is needed for
@code{mysqldump --disable-keys} to work.

Fixed unlikely caching bug when doing a join without keys. In this case,
the last used field for a table always returned @code{NULL}.
@item
Added options to make @code{LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE} more secure.
@item
MySQL binary release 3.23.48 for Linux contained a new @code{glibc} library,

Added @code{--xml} option to @code{mysqldump} for producing XML output.
@item
Changed to use @code{autoconf} 2.52 (from @code{autoconf} 2.13)
@item
Fixed bug in complicated join with @code{const} tables.
@item
Added internal safety checks for @code{InnoDB}.
@item
Some @code{InnoDB} variables were always shown in @code{SHOW VARIABLES} as
@code{OFF} on high-byte-first systems (like SPARC).
@item
Fixed problem with one thread using an @code{InnoDB} table and another
thread doing an @code{ALTER TABLE} on the same table. Before that,
@code{mysqld} could crash with an assertion failure in @file{row0row.c},
line 474.
@item
Tuned the @code{InnoDB} SQL optimizer to favor index searches more often
over table scans.
@item
Fixed a performance problem with @code{InnoDB} tables when several large
@code{SELECT} queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux
computer.  Large CPU-bound @code{SELECT} queries will now also generally
run faster on all platforms.
@item
If MySQL binary logging is used, @code{InnoDB} now prints after crash recovery the
latest MySQL binary log name and the offset @code{InnoDB} was able to recover
to. This is useful, for example, when resynchronizing a master and a
slave database in replication.
@item
Added better error messages to help in installation problems of @code{InnoDB}
tables.
@item
It is now possible to recover MySQL temporary tables that have become
orphaned inside the @code{InnoDB} tablespace.
@item
@code{InnoDB} now prevents a @code{FOREIGN KEY} declaration where the
signedness is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
@item
Calling @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} or @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} could cause
memory corruption and make @code{mysqld} crash.  Especially at risk was
@code{mysqldump}, because it frequently calls @code{SHOW CREATE TABLE}.
@item
If inserts to several tables containing an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column were
wrapped inside one @code{LOCK TABLES}, @code{InnoDB} asserted in
@file{lock0lock.c}.
@item
In 3.23.47 we allowed several @code{NULL} values in a @code{UNIQUE} secondary
index for an @code{InnoDB} table.  But @code{CHECK TABLE} was not relaxed: it
reports the table as corrupt.  @code{CHECK TABLE} no longer complains in
this situation.
@item
@code{SHOW GRANTS} now shows @code{REFERENCES} instead of @code{REFERENCE}.

Accent characters in the default character set @code{latin1} are ordered
according to the MySQL ordering.

Note: If you are using @code{latin1} and have inserted characters whose
code is greater than 127 into an indexed @code{CHAR} column, you should

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.38 (09 May 2001)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a bug when @code{SELECT} from @code{MERGE} table
sometimes results in incorrectly ordered rows.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{REPLACE()} when using the @code{ujis} character set.
@item
Applied Sleepycat @code{BDB} patches 3.2.9.1 and 3.2.9.2.
@item
Added @code{--skip-stack-trace} option to @code{mysqld}.
@item
@code{CREATE TEMPORARY} now works with @code{InnoDB} tables.
@item
@code{InnoDB} now promotes sub keys to whole keys.
@item
Added option @code{CONCURRENT} to @code{LOAD DATA}.
@item
Better error message when slave @code{max_allowed_packet} is too low to
read a very long log event from the master.
@item
Fixed bug when too many rows where removed when using
@code{SELECT DISTINCT ... HAVING}.
@item
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} now returns @code{TEMPORARY} for temporary tables.
@item
Added @code{Rows_examined} to slow query log.
@item
Fixed problems with function returning empty string when used together with
a group function and a @code{WHERE} that didn't match any rows.
@item
New program @code{mysqlcheck}.
@item
Added database name to output for administrative commands like @code{CHECK},
@code{REPAIR}, @code{OPTIMIZE}.
@item
Lots of portability fixes for @code{InnoDB}.
@item
Changed optimizer so that queries like
@code{SELECT * FROM tbl_name,tbl_name2 ... ORDER BY key_part1 LIMIT row_count}
will use index on @code{key_part1} instead of @code{filesort}.
@item
Fixed bug when doing
@code{LOCK TABLE to_table WRITE,...; INSERT INTO to_table... SELECT ...}
when @code{to_table} was empty.
@item
Fixed bug with @code{LOCK TABLE} and @code{BDB} tables.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.37 (17 Apr 2001)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a bug when using @code{MATCH()} in @code{HAVING} clause.
@item
Fixed a bug when using @code{HEAP} tables with @code{LIKE}.
@item
Added @code{--mysql-version} option to @code{safe_mysqld}
@item
Changed @code{INNOBASE} to @code{InnoDB} (because the @code{INNOBASE}
name was already used). All @code{configure} options and @code{mysqld}
start options now use @code{innodb} instead of @code{innobase}. This
means that before upgrading to this version, you have to change any
configuration files where you have used @code{innobase} options!
@item
Fixed bug when using indexes on @code{CHAR(255) NULL} columns.
@item
Slave thread will now be started even if @code{master-host} is not set, as
long as @code{server-id} is set and valid @file{master.info} is present.
@item
Partial updates (terminated with kill) are now logged with a special error
code to the binary log. Slave will refuse to execute them if the error code
indicates the update was terminated abnormally, and will have to be recovered
with @code{SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START} after a manual sanity
check/correction of data integrity.
@item
Fixed bug that erroneously logged a drop of internal temporary table
on thread termination to the binary log --- this bug affected replication.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{REGEXP} on 64-bit machines.
@item
@code{UPDATE} and @code{DELETE} with @code{WHERE unique_key_part IS NULL}
didn't update/delete all rows.
@item
Disabled @code{INSERT DELAYED} for tables that support transactions.
@item
Fixed bug when using date functions on @code{TEXT}/@code{BLOB} column
with wrong date format.
@item
UDFs now also work on Windows. (Patch by Ralph Mason.)
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE} and @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} that disabled
key-sorting. These commands should now be faster in most cases.
@item
Fixed performance bug where reopened tables (tables that had been
waiting for @code{FLUSH} or @code{REPAIR}) would not use indexes for the
next query.
@item
Fixed problem with @code{ALTER TABLE} to @code{InnoDB} tables on FreeBSD.
@item
Added @code{mysqld} variables @code{myisam_max_sort_file_size} and
@code{myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size}.
@item
Initialize signals early to avoid problem with signals in @code{InnoDB}.
@item
Applied patch for the @code{tis620} character set to make comparisons
case-independent and to fix a bug in @code{LIKE} for this character set.
@strong{Note:} All tables that uses the @code{tis620} character set must be
fixed with  @code{myisamchk -r} or @code{REPAIR TABLE} !
@item
Added @code{--skip-safemalloc} option to @code{mysqld}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a bug that allowed use of database names containing a @samp{.}
character.  This fixes a serious security issue when @code{mysqld} is run
as root.
@item
Fixed bug when thread creation failed (could happen when doing a @strong{lot}
of connections in a short time).
@item
Fixed some problems with @code{FLUSH TABLES} and @code{TEMPORARY} tables.
(Problem with freeing the key cache and error @code{Can't reopen table...}.)
@item
Fixed a problem in @code{InnoDB} with other character sets than @code{latin1}
and another problem when using many columns.
@item
Fixed bug that caused a core dump when using a very complex query involving
@code{DISTINCT} and summary functions.
@item
Added @code{SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...}
@item
Added @code{SELECT ... FOR UPDATE}.
@item
Fixed bug where the number of affected rows was not returned when MySQL
was compiled without transaction support.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{UPDATE} where keys weren't always used to find the
rows to be updated.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{CONCAT_WS()} where it returned incorrect results.
@item
Changed @code{CREATE ... SELECT} and @code{INSERT ... SELECT} to not
allow concurrent inserts as this could make the binary log hard to repeat.
(Concurrent inserts are enabled if you are not using the binary or update log.)
@item
Changed some macros to be able to use fast mutex with @code{glibc} 2.2.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.34 (10 Mar 2001)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Added the @code{INNOBASE} storage engine and the @code{BDB} storage engine
to the MySQL source distribution.
@item
Updated the documentation about @code{GEMINI} tables.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{INSERT DELAYED} that caused threads to hang when
inserting @code{NULL} into an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} column.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{CHECK TABLE} / @code{REPAIR TABLE} that could cause
a thread to hang.
@item
@code{REPLACE} will not replace a row that conflicts with an
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT} generated key.
@item
@code{mysqld} now only sets @code{CLIENT_TRANSACTIONS} in
@code{mysql->server_capabilities} if the server supports a
transaction-safe storage engine.
@item
Fixed @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} to allow numeric values to be read into
@code{ENUM} and @code{SET} columns.
@item
Improved error diagnostic for slave thread exit.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY}.
@item
Added @code{max_user_connections} variable to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Limit query length for replication by @code{max_allowed_packet}, not the
arbitrary limit of 4MB.
@item
Allow space around @code{=} in argument to @code{--set-variable}.
@item
Fixed problem in automatic repair that could leave some threads in state
@code{Waiting for table}.
@item
@code{SHOW CREATE TABLE} now displays the @code{UNION=()} for @code{MERGE}
tables.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} now remembers the old @code{UNION=()} definition.
@item
Fixed bug when replicating timestamps.
@item
Fixed bug in bidirectional replication.
@item
Fixed bug in the @code{BDB} storage engine that occurred when using an index
on multi-part key where a key part may be @code{NULL}.
@item
Fixed @code{MAX()} optimization on sub-key for @code{BDB} tables.
@item
Fixed problem where garbage results were returned when using @code{BDB}
tables and @code{BLOB} or @code{TEXT} fields when joining many tables.
@item
Fixed a problem with @code{BDB} tables and @code{TEXT} columns.
@item
Fixed bug when using a @code{BLOB} key where a const row wasn't found.
@item
Fixed that @code{mysqlbinlog} writes the timestamp value for each query.
This ensures that one gets same values for date functions like @code{NOW()}
when using @code{mysqlbinlog} to pipe the queries to another server.
@item
Allow @code{--skip-gemini}, @code{--skip-bdb}, and @code{--skip-innodb}
options to be specified when invoking @code{mysqld}, even if these storage
engines are not compiled in to @code{mysqld}.
@item
You can now use @code{ASC} and @code{DESC} with @code{GROUP BY} columns
to specify a sort order.
@item
Fixed a deadlock in the @code{SET} code, when one ran @code{SET @@foo=bar},
where @code{bar} is a column reference, an error was not properly generated.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.33 (09 Feb 2001)

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed DNS lookups not to use the same mutex as the hostname
cache.  This will enable known hosts to be quickly resolved even if a
DNS lookup takes a long time.
@item
Added @code{--character-sets-dir} option to @code{myisampack}.
@item
Removed warnings when running @code{REPAIR TABLE ... EXTENDED}.
@item
Fixed a bug that caused a core dump when using @code{GROUP BY} on an alias,
where the alias was the same as an existing column name.
@item
Added @code{SEQUENCE()} as an example UDF function.
@item
Changed @code{mysql_install_db} to use @code{BINARY} for @code{CHAR}
columns in the privilege tables.
@item
Changed @code{TRUNCATE tbl_name} to @code{TRUNCATE TABLE tbl_name}
to use the same syntax as Oracle.  Until 4.0 we will also allow
@code{TRUNCATE tbl_name} to not crash old code.
@item
Fixed ``no found rows'' bug in @code{MyISAM} tables when a @code{BLOB} was
first part of a multi-part key.
@item
Fixed bug where @code{CASE} didn't work with @code{GROUP BY}.
@item
Added @code{--sort-recover} option to @code{myisamchk}.
@item
@code{myisamchk -S} and @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} now work on Windows.
@item
Fixed bug when using @code{DISTINCT} on results from functions that referred
to a group function, like:
@example
SELECT a, DISTINCT SEC_TO_TIME(SUM(a))
FROM tbl_name GROUP BY a, b;
@end example
@item
Fixed buffer overrun in @code{libmysqlclient} library.
Fixed bug in handling @code{STOP} event after @code{ROTATE} event in
replication.
@item
Fixed another buffer overrun in @code{DROP DATABASE}.
@item
Added @code{Table_locks_immediate} and @code{Table_locks_waited} status
variables.
@item
Fixed bug in replication that broke slave server start with existing
@file{master.info}. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.23.32.
@item
Added @code{SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n} command to recover from
replication glitches without a full database copy.
@item
Added @code{max_binlog_size} variable; the binary log will be rotated
automatically when the size crosses the limit.
@item
Added @code{Last_Error}, @code{Last_Errno}, and @code{Slave_skip_counter}
variables to @code{SHOW SLAVE STATUS}.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MASTER_POS_WAIT()} function.
@item
Execute core dump handler on @code{SIGILL}, and @code{SIGBUS} in addition to
@code{SIGSEGV}.
@item
On x86 Linux, print the current query and thread (connection) id, if
available, in the core dump handler.
@item
Fixed several timing bugs in the test suite.
@item
Extended @code{mysqltest} to take care of the timing issues in the test
suite.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} can now be used to change the definition for a
@code{MERGE} table.
@item
Fixed creation of @code{MERGE} tables on Windows.
@item
Portability fixes for OpenBSD and OS/2.
@item
Added @code{--temp-pool} option to @code{mysqld}.  Using this option
will cause most temporary files created to use a small set of names,
rather than a unique name for each new file.  This is to work around a
problem in the Linux kernel dealing with creating a bunch of new files
with different names.  With the old behavior, Linux seems to "leak"
memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache instead of
the disk cache.

Changed code to get around compiler bug in Compaq C++ on OSF/1, that broke
@code{BACKUP}, @code{RESTORE}, @code{CHECK}, @code{REPAIR}, and
@code{ANALYZE TABLE}.
@item

Fixed security bug in something (please upgrade if you are using an earlier
MySQL 3.23 version).
@item
Fixed buffer overflow bug when writing a certain error message.
@item
Added usage of @code{setrlimit()} on Linux to get
@code{-O --open_files_limit=#} to work on Linux.
@item

@item
Fixed bug when using expression of type:
@example
SELECT ... FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON (t1.a=t2.a) WHERE t1.a=t2.a
@end example
In this case the test in the @code{WHERE} clause was wrongly optimized away.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MyISAM} when deleting keys with possible @code{NULL}
values, but the first key-column was not a prefix-compressed text column.
@item
Fixed @code{mysql.server} to read the @code{[mysql.server]} option file group
rather than the @code{[mysql_server]} group.
@item

@item
Configure updates for Tru64, large file support, and better TCP wrapper
support. By Albert Chin-A-Young.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{<=>} operator.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{REPLACE} with @code{BDB} tables.
@item
@code{LPAD()} and @code{RPAD()} will shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.
@item
Added @code{SHOW LOGS} command.
@item
Remove unused @code{BDB} logs on shutdown.
@item
When creating a table, put @code{PRIMARY} keys first, followed by
@code{UNIQUE} keys.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{UPDATE} involving multi-part keys where you
specified all key parts both in the update and the @code{WHERE} part. In
this case MySQL could try to update a record that didn't match
the whole @code{WHERE} part.
@item
Changed drop table to first drop the tables and then the @file{.frm} file.
@item
Fixed a bug in the hostname cache which caused @code{mysqld} to report the
hostname as @code{''} in some error messages.
@item
Fixed a bug with @code{HEAP} type tables; the variable
@code{max_heap_table_size} wasn't used. Now either @code{MAX_ROWS} or
@code{max_heap_table_size} can be used to limit the size of a @code{HEAP}
type table.
@item
Changed the default @code{server-id} value to 1 for masters and 2 for slaves
to make it easier to use the binary log.
@item
Renamed @code{bdb_lock_max} variable to @code{bdb_max_lock}.
@item
Added support for @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} on sub-fields for @code{BDB} tables.
@item
Added @code{ANALYZE} of @code{BDB} tables.
@item
In @code{BDB} tables, we now store the number of rows; this helps to optimize
queries when we need an approximation of the number of rows.
@item
If we get an error in a multiple-row statement, we now only roll back the
last statement, not the entire transaction.
@item
If you do a @code{ROLLBACK} when you have updated a non-transactional table
you will get an error as a warning.
@item
Added @code{--bdb-shared-data} option to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Added @code{Slave_open_temp_tables} status variable to @code{mysqld}

@code{DROP TABLE}, @code{RENAME TABLE}, @code{CREATE INDEX} and
@code{DROP INDEX} are now transaction endpoints.
@item
If you do a @code{DROP DATABASE} on a symbolically linked database, both
the link and the original database are deleted.
@item
Fixed @code{DROP DATABASE} to work on OS/2.
@item
Fixed bug when doing a @code{SELECT DISTINCT ... table1 LEFT JOIN
table2 ...} when @code{table2} was empty.
@item
Added @code{--abort-slave-event-count} and
@code{--disconnect-slave-event-count} options to @code{mysqld} for
debugging and testing of replication.
@item
Fixed replication of temporary tables. Handles everything except
slave server restart.
@item
@code{SHOW KEYS} now shows whether key is @code{FULLTEXT}.
@item
New script @code{mysqld_multi}. @xref{mysqld_multi, , @code{mysqld_multi}}.
@item
Added new script, @code{mysql-multi.server.sh}.  Thanks to
Tim Bunce @email{Tim.Bunce@@ig.co.uk} for modifying @code{mysql.server} to
easily handle hosts running many @code{mysqld} processes.
@item
@code{safe_mysqld}, @code{mysql.server}, and @code{mysql_install_db} have
been modified to use @code{mysql_print_defaults} instead of various hacks
to read the @file{my.cnf} files.  In addition, the handling of various
paths has been made more consistent with how @code{mysqld} handles them
by default.
@item
Automatically remove Berkeley DB transaction logs that no longer are in
use.
@item
Fixed bug with several @code{FULLTEXT} indexes in one table.
@item
Added a warning if number of rows changes on @code{REPAIR}/@code{OPTIMIZE}.
@item
Applied patches for OS/2 by @code{Yuri Dario}.
@item
@code{FLUSH TABLES tbl_name} didn't always flush the index tree
to disk properly.
@item
@code{--bootstrap} is now run in a separate thread. This fixes a problem
that caused @code{mysql_install_db} to core dump on some Linux machines.
@item
Changed @code{mi_create()} to use less stack space.
@item
Fixed bug with optimizer trying to over-optimize @code{MATCH()} when used
with @code{UNIQUE} key.
@item
Changed @code{crash-me} and the MySQL benchmarks to also work
with FrontBase.
@item
Allow @code{RESTRICT} and @code{CASCADE} after @code{DROP TABLE} to make
porting easier.
@item
Reset status variable which could cause problem if one used @code{--slow-log}.
@item
Added @code{connect_timeout} variable to @code{mysql} and @code{mysqladmin}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Added new options @code{--pager[=...]}, @code{--no-pager},
@code{--tee=...} and @code{--no-tee} to the @code{mysql} client.  The
new corresponding interactive commands are @code{pager}, @code{nopager},
@code{tee} and @code{notee}. @xref{mysql, , @code{mysql}}, @code{mysql --help}
and the interactive help for more information.
@item
Fixed crash when automatic repair of @code{MyISAM} table failed.
@item
Fixed a major performance bug in the table locking code when a lot
of @code{SELECT}, @code{UPDATE} and @code{INSERT} statements
constantly were running. The symptom was that the @code{UPDATE} and
@code{INSERT} queries were locked for a long time while new @code{SELECT}
statements were executed before the updates.
@item
When reading @code{options_files} with @code{mysql_options()} the
@code{return-found-rows} option was ignored.
@item
One can now specify @code{interactive-timeout} in the option file that
is read by @code{mysql_options()}. This makes it possible to force
programs that run for a long time (like @code{mysqlhotcopy}) to use the
@code{interactive_timeout} time instead of the @code{wait_timeout} time.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Changed sort order for 'German'; all tables created with 'German' sortorder
must be repaired with @code{REPAIR TABLE} or @code{myisamchk} before use!
@item
Added @code{--core-file} option to @code{mysqld} to get a core file on
Linux if @code{mysqld} dies on the @code{SIGSEGV} signal.
@item
MySQL client @code{mysql} now starts with option
@code{--no-named-commands} (@code{-g}) by default. This option can be
disabled with @code{--enable-named-commands} (@code{-G}). This may cause
incompatibility problems in some cases, for example, in SQL scripts that
use named commands without a semicolon, etc.!  Long format commands
still work from the first line.
@item
Fixed a problem when using many pending @code{DROP TABLE} statements at
the same time.
@item
Optimizer didn't use keys properly when using @code{LEFT JOIN} on an
empty table.
@item
Added shorter help text when invoking @code{mysqld} with incorrect options.
@item
Fixed non-fatal @code{free()} bug in @code{mysqlimport}.
@item
Fixed bug in @code{MyISAM} index handling of
@code{DECIMAL}/@code{NUMERIC} keys.
@item
Fixed a bug in concurrent insert in @code{MyISAM} tables.  In some contexts,
usage of @code{MIN(key_part)} or @code{MAX(key_part)} returned an empty set.
@item
Updated @code{mysqlhotcopy} to use the new @code{FLUSH TABLES table_list}
syntax. Only tables which are being backed up are flushed now.
@item
Changed behavior of @code{--enable-thread-safe-client} so
that both non-threaded (@code{-lmysqlclient}) and threaded
(@code{-lmysqlclient_r}) libraries are built.  Users who linked
against a threaded @code{-lmysqlclient} will need to link against
@code{-lmysqlclient_r} now.
@item
Added atomic @code{RENAME TABLE} command.
@item
Don't count @code{NULL} values in @code{COUNT(DISTINCT ...)}.
@item
Changed @code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} on empty tables and
@code{INSERT ... SELECT ...} on empty tables to create non-unique indexes
in a separate batch with sorting. This will make these statements much
faster when you have many indexes.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} now logs the first used insert_id correctly.
@item
Fixed crash when adding a default value to a @code{BLOB} column.
@item
Fixed a bug with @code{DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB} where it returned a datetime instead
of a date.
@item
Fixed a problem with the thread cache which made some threads show up as
@code{***DEAD***} in @code{SHOW PROCESSLIST}.
@item
Fixed a lock in our thr_rwlock code, which could make selects that run
at the same time as concurrent inserts crash. This affects only systems
that don't have the @code{pthread_rwlock_rdlock} code.
@item
When deleting rows with a non-unique key in a @code{HEAP} table, all rows
weren't always deleted.
@item
Fixed bug in range optimizer for @code{HEAP} tables for searches on a part
index.

Fixed @code{SELECT} on part keys to work with @code{BDB} tables.
@item
Fixed @code{INSERT INTO bdb_table ... SELECT} to work with @code{BDB} tables.
@item
@code{CHECK TABLE} now updates key statistics for the table.
@item
@code{ANALYZE TABLE} will now only update tables that have been changed
since the last @code{ANALYZE}. Note that this is a new feature and tables
will not be marked to be analysed until they are updated in any way with
3.23.23 or newer.  For older tables, you have to do @code{CHECK TABLE}
to update the key distribution.
@item
Fixed some minor privilege problems with @code{CHECK}, @code{ANALYZE},
@code{REPAIR} and @code{SHOW CREATE} commands.
@item
Added @code{CHANGE MASTER TO} statement.
@item
Added @code{FAST}, @code{QUICK} @code{EXTENDED} check types to
@code{CHECK TABLES}.
@item
Changed @code{myisamchk} so that @code{--fast} and
@code{--check-only-changed} are also honored with @code{--sort-index} and
@code{--analyze}.
@item
Fixed fatal bug in @code{LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER} that did not lock the
table during index re-build.
@item
@code{LOAD DATA INFILE} broke replication if the database was excluded
from replication.

Added @code{mysqlbinlog} program for displaying binary log files in text
format.
@item
Added @code{mysql_real_escape_string()} function to the MySQL C API.
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{CONCAT()} where one of the arguments was a function
that returned a modified argument.
@item
Fixed a critical bug in @code{myisamchk}, where it updated the header in
the index file when one only checked the table.  This confused the
@code{mysqld} daemon if it updated the same table at the same time. Now
the status in the index file is only updated if one uses
@code{--update-state}.  With older @code{myisamchk} versions you should
use @code{--read-only} when only checking tables, if there is the
slightest chance that the @code{mysqld} server is working on the table at the
same time!
@item
Fixed that @code{DROP TABLE} is logged in the update log.
@item
Fixed problem when searching on @code{DECIMAL()} key field
where the column data contained leading zeros.
@item

the first key.
@item
Allow @code{DATETIME} in ISO8601 format: 2000-03-12T12:00:00
@item
Dynamic character sets.  A @code{mysqld} binary can now handle many different
character sets (you can choose which when starting @code{mysqld}).
@item
Added command @code{REPAIR TABLE}.
@item
Added @code{mysql_thread_safe()} function to the MySQL C API.
@item
Added the @code{UMASK_DIR} environment variable.
@item
Added @code{CONNECTION_ID()} function to return the client connection thread
ID.
@item
When using @code{=} on @code{BLOB} or @code{VARCHAR BINARY} keys, where
only a part of the column was indexed, the whole column of the result
row wasn't compared.
@item
Fix for @code{sjis} character set and @code{ORDER BY}.

@item
LOTS of patches for Linux Alpha. MySQL now appears to be relatively
stable on Alpha.
@item
Changed @code{DISTINCT} on @code{HEAP} temporary tables to use hashed
keys to quickly find duplicated rows. This mostly concerns queries of
type @code{SELECT DISTINCT ... GROUP BY ...}.  This fixes a problem where
not all duplicates were removed in queries of the above type.  In
addition, the new code is MUCH faster.
@item
Added patches to make MySQL compile on Mac OS X.
@item
Added @code{IF NOT EXISTS} clause to @code{CREATE DATABASE}.

@item
Fixed optimizer problem on @code{SELECT} when using many overlapping indexes.
MySQL should now be able to choose keys even better when there
are many keys to choose from.
@item
Changed optimizer to prefer a range key instead of a ref key when the
range key can uses more columns than the ref key (which only can use
columns with @code{=}).  For example, the following type of queries should now
be faster: @code{SELECT * from key_part_1=const and key_part_2 > const2}
@item
Fixed bug that a change of all @code{VARCHAR} columns to @code{CHAR} columns

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.23.0 (05 Aug 1999: Alpha)

@itemize @bullet
@item
A new storage engine library (@code{MyISAM}) with a lot of new features.
@xref{MyISAM, , @code{MyISAM}}.
@item
You can create in-memory @code{HEAP} tables which are extremely fast for
lookups.
@item
Support for big files (63-bit) on OSs that support big files.
@item
New function @code{LOAD_FILE(filename)} to get the contents of a file as a
string value.
@item
New @code{<=>} operator that acts as @code{=} but returns TRUE
if both arguments are @code{NULL}.  This is useful for comparing changes
between tables.
@item
Added the ODBC 3.0 @code{EXTRACT(interval FROM datetime)} function.
@item
Columns defined as @code{FLOAT(X)} are not rounded on storage and may be
in scientific notation (1.0 E+10) when retrieved.
@item
@code{REPLACE} is now faster than before.
@item
Changed @code{LIKE} character comparison to behave as @code{=};
This means that @code{'e' LIKE '@'e'} is now true.  (If the line doesn't
display correctly, the latter 'e' is a French 'e' with an acute accent above.)
@item
@code{SHOW TABLE STATUS} returns a lot of information about the tables.
@item
Added @code{LIKE} to the @code{SHOW STATUS} command.
@item
Added @code{Privileges} column to @code{SHOW COLUMNS}.
@item
Added @code{Packed} and @code{Comment} columns to @code{SHOW INDEX}.
@item
Added comments to tables (with @code{CREATE TABLE ... COMMENT "xxx"}).
@item
Added @code{UNIQUE}, as in
@code{CREATE TABLE tbl_name (col INT not null UNIQUE)}
@item
New create syntax: @code{CREATE TABLE tbl_name SELECT ...}
@item
New create syntax: @code{CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...}
@item
Allow creation of @code{CHAR(0)} columns.
@item
@code{DATE_FORMAT()} now requires @samp{%} before any format character.
@item
@code{DELAYED} is now a reserved word (sorry about that :( ).
@item
An example procedure is added: @code{analyse}, file: @file{sql_analyse.c}.
This will describe the data in your query.  Try the following:
@example
SELECT ... FROM ...
WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max elements,[max memory]])
@end example

This procedure is extremely useful when you want to check the data in your
table!
@item
@code{BINARY} cast to force a string to be compared in case-sensitive fashion.
@item
Added @code{--skip-show-database} option to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Check whether a row has changed in an @code{UPDATE} now also works
with @code{BLOB}/@code{TEXT} columns.
@item
Added the @code{INNER} join syntax.  @strong{Note:}  This made @code{INNER}
a reserved word!
@item
Added support for netmasks to the hostname in the MySQL grant tables.
You can specify a netmask using the @code{IP/NETMASK} syntax.
@item
If you compare a @code{NOT NULL DATE/DATETIME} column with @code{IS
NULL}, this is changed to a compare against @code{0} to satisfy some ODBC
applications.  (By @email{shreeve@@uci.edu}.)
@item
@code{NULL IN (...)} now returns @code{NULL} instead of @code{0}.  This will
ensure that @code{null_column NOT IN (...)} doesn't match
@code{NULL} values.
@item
Fix storage of floating-point values in @code{TIME} columns.
@item
Changed parsing of @code{TIME} strings to be more strict.  Now the
fractional second part is detected (and currently skipped). The
following formats are supported:
@itemize @bullet
@item [[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]
@item [[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]
@end itemize
@item
Detect (and ignore) fractional second part from @code{DATETIME}.
@item
Added the @code{LOW_PRIORITY} attribute to @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
@item
The default index name now uses the same case as the column name on which the
index name is based.
@item
Changed default number of connections to 100.
@item
Use bigger buffers when using @code{LOAD DATA INFILE}.
@item
@code{DECIMAL(x,y)} now works according to standard SQL.
@item
Added aggregate UDF functions. Thanks to Andreas F. Bobak
(@email{bobak@@relog.ch}) for this!
@item
@code{LAST_INSERT_ID()} is now updated for @code{INSERT INTO ... SELECT}.
@item
Some small changes to the join table optimizer to make some joins faster.
@item
@code{SELECT DISTINCT} is much faster; it uses the new @code{UNIQUE}
functionality in @code{MyISAM}. One difference compared to MySQL 3.22
is that the output of @code{DISTINCT} is no longer sorted.
@item
All C client API macros are now functions to make shared libraries more
reliable. Because of this, you can no longer call @code{mysql_num_fields()} on
a @code{MYSQL} object, you must use @code{mysql_field_count()} instead.
@item
Added use of @code{LIBWRAP}; patch by Henning P. Schmiedehausen.
@item
Don't allow @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} for other than numerical columns.
@item
Using @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} will now automatically make the column
@code{NOT NULL}.
@item
Show @code{NULL} as the default value for @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} columns.
@item
Added @code{SQL_BIG_RESULT}; @code{SQL_SMALL_RESULT} is now default.
@item
Added a shared library RPM. This enhancement was contributed by David
Fox (@email{dsfox@@cogsci.ucsd.edu}).
@item
Added  @code{--enable-large-files} and @code{--disable-large-files} options
to @code{configure}. See @file{configure.in} for some systems where this is
automatically turned off because of broken implementations.
@item
Upgraded @code{readline} to 4.0.
@item
New @code{CREATE TABLE} options: @code{PACK_KEYS} and @code{CHECKSUM}.
@item
Added @code{--default-table-type} option to @code{mysqld}.

@appendixsec Changes in release 3.22.x (Old; discontinued)

@cindex changes, version 3.22

The 3.22 version has faster and safer connect code than version 3.21, as well
as a lot of new nice enhancements.
As there aren't really any major changes, upgrading from 3.21 to 3.22 should
be very easy and painless.  @xref{Upgrading-from-3.21}.

@item
Fixed bug in @code{GRANT} checking with @code{SELECT} on many tables.
@item
Added missing file @code{mysql_fix_privilege_tables} to the RPM

@code{mysql_install_db} no longer starts the MySQL server!  You
should start @code{mysqld} with @code{safe_mysqld} after installing it!  The
MySQL RPM will, however, start the server as before.
@item
Added @code{--bootstrap} option to @code{mysqld} and recoded
@code{mysql_install_db} to use it.  This will make it easier to install
MySQL with RPMs.
@item
Changed @code{+}, @code{-} (sign and minus), @code{*}, @code{/}, @code{%},
@code{ABS()} and @code{MOD()} to be @code{BIGINT} aware (64-bit safe).
@item
Fixed a bug in @code{ALTER TABLE} that caused @code{mysqld} to crash.

Added @code{LIMIT} clause for the @code{DELETE} statement.
@item
You can now use the @code{/*! ... */} syntax to hide MySQL-specific
keywords when you write portable code.  MySQL will parse the code
inside the comments as if the surrounding @code{/*!} and @code{*/} comment
characters didn't exist.
@item
@code{OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name} can now be used to reclaim disk space
after many deletes.  Currently, this uses @code{ALTER TABLE} to
regenerate the table, but in the future it will use an integrated
@code{isamchk} for more speed.
@item
Upgraded @code{libtool} to get the configure more portable.
@item
Fixed slow @code{UPDATE} and @code{DELETE} operations when using
@code{DATETIME} or @code{DATE} keys.
@item
Changed optimizer to make it better at deciding when to do a full join
and when using keys.
@item
You can now use @code{mysqladmin proc} to display information about your own
threads. Only users with the @code{PROCESS} privilege can get
information about all threads.
(In 4.0.2, you need the @code{SUPER} privilege for this.)
@item
Added handling of formats @code{YYMMDD}, @code{YYYYMMDD},
@code{YYMMDDHHMMSS} for numbers when using @code{DATETIME} and
@code{TIMESTAMP} types. (Formerly these formats only worked with strings.)
@item
Added connect option @code{CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE} to allow use of spaces
after function names and before @samp{(} (Powerbuilder requires this).
This will make all function names reserved words.
@item
Added the @code{--log-long-format} option to @code{mysqld} to enable timestamps
and INSERT_IDs in the update log.

@item
All table lock handing is changed to avoid some very subtle
deadlocks when using @code{DROP TABLE}, @code{ALTER TABLE}, @code{DELETE FROM
TABLE} and @code{mysqladmin flush-tables} under heavy usage.
Changed locking code to get better handling of locks of different types.
@item
Updated @code{DBI} to 1.00 and @code{DBD} to 1.2.0.
@item
Added a check that the error message file contains error messages suitable for
the current version of @code{mysqld}. (To avoid errors if you accidentally
try to use an old error message file.)
@item
All count structures in the client (@code{affected_rows()},
@code{insert_id()}, ...) are now of type @code{BIGINT} to allow 64-bit values
to be used.
This required a minor change in the MySQL protocol which should affect
only old clients when using tables with @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} values > 16MB.
@item
The return type of @code{mysql_fetch_lengths()} has changed from @code{uint *}
to @code{ulong *}. This may give a warning for old clients but should work
on most machines.
@item
Change @code{mysys} and @code{dbug} libraries to allocate all thread variables
in one struct.  This makes it easier to make a threaded @file{libmysql.dll}
library.
@item
Use the result from @code{gethostname()} (instead of @code{uname()}) when
constructing @file{.pid} file names.
@item
New better compressed client/server protocol.
@item
@code{COUNT()}, @code{STD()} and @code{AVG()} are extended to handle more than
4GB rows.
@item
You can now store values in the range @code{-838:59:59} <= x <=
@code{838:59:59} in a @code{TIME} column.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!!}
If you set a @code{TIME} column to too short a value, MySQL now
assumes the value is given as: @code{[[[D ]HH:]MM:]SS} instead of
@code{HH[:MM[:SS]]}.
@item
@code{TIME_TO_SEC()} and @code{SEC_TO_TIME()} can now handle negative times
and hours up to 32767.
@item
Added new option
@code{SET SQL_LOG_UPDATE=@{0|1@}} to allow users with
the @code{PROCESS} privilege to bypass the update log.
(Modified patch from Sergey A Mukhin @email{violet@@rosnet.net}.)
@item
Fixed fatal bug in @code{LPAD()}.
@item
Initialize line buffer in @file{mysql.cc} to make @code{BLOB} reading from
pipes safer.
@item
Added @code{-O max_connect_errors=#} option to @code{mysqld}.
Connect errors are now reset for each correct connection.
@item
Increased the default value of @code{max_allowed_packet} to @code{1M} in
@code{mysqld}.
@item
Added @code{--low-priority-updates} option to @code{mysqld}, to give
table-modifying operations (@code{INSERT}, @code{REPLACE}, @code{UPDATE},
@code{DELETE}) lower priority than retrievals.  You can now use
@code{@{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE@} LOW_PRIORITY ...} You can
also use @code{SET SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=@{0|1@}} to change
the priority for one thread.  One side effect is that @code{LOW_PRIORITY}
is now a reserved word. :(
@item
Add support for @code{INSERT INTO table ... VALUES(...),(...),(...)},
to allow inserting multiple rows with a single statement.
@item
@code{INSERT INTO tbl_name} is now also cached when used with @code{LOCK TABLES}.
(Previously only @code{INSERT ... SELECT} and @code{LOAD DATA INFILE} were
cached.)
@item
Allow @code{GROUP BY} functions with @code{HAVING}:
@example
mysql> SELECT col FROM table GROUP BY col HAVING COUNT(*)>0;
@end example
@item
@code{mysqld} will now ignore trailing @samp{;} characters in queries. This
is to make it easier to migrate from some other SQL servers that require the
trailing @samp{;}.
@item
Fix for corrupted fixed-format output generated by @code{SELECT INTO OUTFILE}.
@item
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!}
Added Oracle @code{GREATEST()} and @code{LEAST()} functions.  You must now use
these instead of the @code{MAX()} and @code{MIN()} functions to get the
largest/smallest value from a list of values. These can now handle @code{REAL},
@code{BIGINT} and string (@code{CHAR} or @code{VARCHAR}) values.
@item

You now MUST call @code{mysql_init()} before you call

You don't have to call @code{mysql_init()} if you only use
@code{mysql_connect()}.
@item
Added @code{mysql_options(...,MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT,...)} so you can set a

@item
@code{WEEK()} now takes an optional argument to allow handling of weeks when

@code{WEEK()} assumes the week starts on Sunday.
@item
@code{TIME} columns weren't stored properly (bug in MySQL 3.22.0).

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.22.0

@itemize @bullet
@item
New (backward-compatible) connect protocol that allows you to
specify the database to use when connecting, to get much faster
connections to a specific database.

The @code{mysql_real_connect()} call is changed to:

@example
mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
                   const char *passwd, const char *db, uint port,
                   const char *unix_socket, uint client_flag)
@end example
@item
Each connection is handled by its own thread, rather than by the
master @code{accept()} thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.
@item
All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward-resolution of
the hostname to get better security. @code{mysqld} now has a local hostname
resolver cache so connections should actually be faster than before,
even with this feature.
@item
A site automatically will be blocked from future connections if someone
repeatedly connects with an ``improper header'' (like when one uses telnet).
@item
You can now refer to tables in different databases with references of the form
@code{tbl_name@@db_name} or @code{db_name.tbl_name}.  This makes it possible to
give a user read access to some tables and write access to others simply by
keeping them in different databases!
@item
Added @code{--user} option to @code{mysqld}, to allow it to run
as another Unix user (if it is started as the Unix @code{root} user).
@item
Added caching of users and access rights (for faster access rights checking)
@item
Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change their password with
@code{mysqladmin password "newpwd"}.  This uses encrypted passwords
that are not logged in the normal MySQL log!
@item
All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86 Linux
machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.
@item
For tables that have many columns, the column names are now hashed for
much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some benchmark
tests a lot!)
@item
Some benchmarks are changed to get better individual timing.
(Some loops were so short that a specific test took < 2 seconds. The
loops have been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it easier
to compare different databases. A test that took 1-2 seconds before
now takes 11-24 seconds, which is much better)
@item
Re-arranged @code{SELECT} code to handle some very specific queries
involving group functions (like @code{COUNT(*)}) without a @code{GROUP BY} but
with @code{HAVING}. The following now works:
@example
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) as C FROM table HAVING C > 1;
@end example
@item
Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid some
calls to @code{malloc()}.
@item
Added @code{-T32} option to @code{mysqld}, for running all queries under the
main thread.  This makes it possible to debug @code{mysqld} under Linux with
@code{gdb}!
@item
Added optimization of @code{not_null_column IS NULL} (needed for some Access
queries).
@item
Allow @code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} to be used between two tables to force the optimizer
to join them in a specific order.
@item
String functions now return @code{VARCHAR} rather than @code{CHAR} and
the column type is now @code{VARCHAR} for fields saved as @code{VARCHAR}.
This should make the @code{MyODBC} driver better, but may break some old
MySQL clients that don't handle @code{FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR} the same
way as @code{FIELD_TYPE_CHAR}.
@item
@code{CREATE INDEX} and @code{DROP INDEX} are now implemented through
@code{ALTER TABLE}.
@code{CREATE TABLE} is still the recommended (fast) way to create indexes.
@item
Added @code{--set-variable} option @code{wait_timeout} to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Added time column to @code{mysqladmin processlist} to show how long a query
has taken or how long a thread has slept.
@item
Added lots of new variables to @code{show variables} and some new to
@code{show status}.
@item
Added new type @code{YEAR}. @code{YEAR} is stored in 1 byte with allowable
values of 0, and 1901 to 2155.
@item
Added new @code{DATE} type that is stored in 3 bytes rather than 4 bytes.
All new tables are created with the new date type if you don't use the
@code{--old-protocol} option to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Fixed bug in record caches; for some queries, you could get
@code{Error from table handler: #} on some operating systems.
@item
Added @code{--enable-assembler} option to @code{configure}, for x86 machines
(tested on Linux + @code{gcc}).  This will enable assembler functions for the
most important string functions for more speed!

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed problem when sending @code{SIGHUP} to @code{mysqld};
@code{mysqld} dumped core when starting from boot on some systems.
@item
Fixed problem with losing a little memory for some connections.
@item
@code{DELETE FROM tbl_name} without a @code{WHERE} condition is now done the
long way when you use @code{LOCK TABLES} or if the table is in use, to
avoid race conditions.
@item
@code{INSERT INTO TABLE (timestamp_column) VALUES (NULL);} didn't set timestamp.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed some possible race conditions when doing many reopen/close on the same
tables under heavy load!  This can happen if you execute @code{mysqladmin
refresh} often. This could in some very rare cases corrupt the header of the
index file and cause error 126 or 138.

@item
Fixed fatal bug in @code{refresh()} when running with the
@code{--skip-external-locking} option.  There was a ``very small'' time gap after
a @code{mysqladmin refresh} when a table could be corrupted if one
thread updated a table while another thread did @code{mysqladmin
refresh} and another thread started a new update ont the same table
before the first thread had finished.  A refresh (or
@code{--flush-tables}) will now not return until all used tables are
closed!
@item
@code{SELECT DISTINCT} with a @code{WHERE} clause that didn't match any rows
returned a row in some contexts (bug only in 3.21.31).
@item
@code{GROUP BY} + @code{ORDER BY} returned one empty row when no rows where
found.
@item
Fixed a bug in the range optimizer that wrote
@code{Use_count: Wrong count for ...} in the error log file.

Save the pid of the signal handler thread in the pid file instead
of the pid of the main thread.
@item
Added patch by @email{tommy@@valley.ne.jp} to support Japanese characters
SJIS and UJIS.
@item
Changed @code{safe_mysqld} to redirect startup messages to
@code{'hostname'.err} instead
of @code{'hostname'.log} to reclaim file space on @code{mysqladmin refresh}.
@item
@code{ENUM} always had the first entry as default value.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} wrote two entries to the update log.
@item
@code{sql_acc()} now closes the @code{mysql} grant tables after a reload to
save table space and memory.
@item
Changed @code{LOAD DATA} to use less memory with tables and @code{BLOB}
columns.
@item
Sorting on a function which made a division / 0 produced a wrong set
in some cases.
@item
Fixed @code{SELECT} problem with @code{LEFT()} when using the @code{czech}

@item
Fixed problem in @code{isamchk}; it couldn't repair a packed table in a very
unusual case.
@item
@code{SELECT} statements with @code{&} or @code{|} (bit functions) failed on
columns with @code{NULL} values.

for crackers to kill @code{mysqld} through telnet + TCP/IP.
@item
Fixed bug in range optimizer when using

@item
@code{WHERE} with @code{string_col_key = constant_string} didn't always
find all rows if the column had many values differing only with
characters of the same sort value (like e and e with an accent).
@item
Strings keys looked up with 'ref' were not compared in case-sensitive fashion.

@item
Fixed bug in the join optimizer code when using many part keys

@item
Setting a @code{TIMESTAMP} to @code{NULL} in @code{LOAD DATA INFILE ...} didn't

@item
Fix @code{BETWEEN} to recognize binary strings. Now @code{BETWEEN} is
case-sensitive.
@item
Added @code{--skip-thread-priority} option to @code{mysqld}, for systems
where @code{mysqld} thread scheduling doesn't work properly (BSDI 3.1).
@item
Added ODBC functions @code{DAYNAME()} and @code{MONTHNAME()}.

@item
Fix @code{COUNT(*)} problems when the @code{WHERE} clause didn't match any
records.  (Bug from 3.21.17.)
@item
Removed that @code{NULL = NULL} is true.  Now you must use @code{IS NULL}
or @code{IS NOT NULL} to test whether a value is @code{NULL}.
(This is according to standard SQL but may break
old applications that are ported from @code{mSQL}.)
You can get the old behavior by compiling with @code{-DmSQL_COMPLIANT}.
@item
Fixed bug that caused core-dump when using many @code{LEFT OUTER JOIN} clauses.

@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!} @code{mysqlperl} is now from

@code{TIMESTAMP '1997-01-01 12:10:10'} formats required by standard SQL.
@strong{Warning: Incompatible change!} This has the unfortunate
side effect that you no longer can have columns named @code{DATE}, @code{TIME}
or @code{TIMESTAMP}. :( Old columns can still be accessed through
@code{tbl_name.col_name}!)
@item
Changed Makefiles to hopefully work better with BSD systems. Also,
@file{manual.dvi} is now included in the distribution to avoid having stupid

@item
A new sortorder german-1. That is a normal ISO-Latin1 with a german sort

New portable benchmark suite with @code{DBD}, with test results from
@code{mSQL} 2.0.3, MySQL, PostgreSQL 6.2.1 and Solid server 2.2.
@item
@code{crash-me} is now included with the benchmarks; this is a Perl program
designed to find as many limits as possible in an SQL server. Tested with
@code{mSQL}, PostgreSQL, Solid and MySQL.

@item
Table and column name completion for @code{mysql} command-line tool, by Zeev
Suraski and Andi Gutmans.
@item
Added new command @code{REPLACE} that works like @code{INSERT} but
replaces conflicting records with the new record. @code{REPLACE INTO
TABLE ... SELECT ...} works also.
@item
Added new commands @code{CREATE DATABASE db_name} and @code{DROP
DATABASE db_name}.
@item
Added @code{RENAME} option to @code{ALTER TABLE}: @code{ALTER TABLE name
RENAME TO new_name}.
@item
@code{make_binary_distribution} now includes @file{libgcc.a} in
@file{libmysqlclient.a}. This should make linking work for people who don't
have @code{gcc}.
@item
Changed @code{net_write()} to @code{my_net_write()} because of a name
conflict with Sybase.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Ported to SCO Openserver 5.0.4  with FSU Pthreads.
@item
HP-UX 10.20 should work.
@item
Added new function @code{DATE_FORMAT()}.
@item
Added @code{NOT IN}.
@item
Added automatic removal of 'ODBC function conversions': @code{@{fn now() @}}
@item
Handle ODBC 2.50.3 option flags.
@item
Fixed comparison of @code{DATE} and @code{TIME} values with @code{NULL}.
@item
Changed language name from germany to german to be consistent with
the other language names.
@item
Fixed sorting problem on functions returning a @code{FLOAT}. Previously, the
values were converted to @code{INT} values before sorting.
@item
Fixed slow sorting when sorting on key field when using
@code{key_column=constant}.
@item
Sorting on calculated @code{DOUBLE} values sorted on integer results instead.
@item
@code{mysql} no longer requires a database argument.
@item
Changed the place where @code{HAVING} should be. According to the SQL standards, it should
be after @code{GROUP BY} but before @code{ORDER BY}. MySQL 3.20
incorrectly had it last.
@item
Added Sybase command @code{USE database} to start using another database.
@item
Added automatic adjusting of number of connections and table cache size
if the maximum number of files that can be opened is less than needed.
This should fix that @code{mysqld} doesn't crash even if you haven't done a
@code{ulimit -n 256} before starting @code{mysqld}.
@item
Added lots of limit checks to make it safer when running with too little
memory or when doing weird queries.

@code{SELECT}.
@item
Fixed bug with @code{LIKE} on number key.

Fixed @code{ftruncate()} call in MIT-pthreads. This made @code{isamchk}
destroy the @file{.ISM} files on (Free)BSD 2.x systems.
@item
Fixed broken @code{__P_} patch in MIT-pthreads.
@item
Many memory overrun checks. All string functions now return @code{NULL}
if the returned string should be longer than @code{max_allowed_packet} bytes.
@item
Changed the name of the @code{INTERVAL} type to @code{ENUM}, because
@code{INTERVAL} is used in standard SQL.
@item
In some cases, doing a @code{JOIN} + @code{GROUP} + @code{INTO OUTFILE},
the result wasn't grouped.
@item
@code{LIKE} with @code{'_'} as last character didn't work. Fixed.
@item
Added extended standard SQL @code{TRIM()} function.
@item
Added @code{CURTIME()}.
@item
Added @code{ENCRYPT()} function by Zeev Suraski.
@item
Fixed better @code{FOREIGN KEY} syntax skipping. New reserved words:
@code{MATCH}, @code{FULL}, @code{PARTIAL}.
@item
@code{mysqld} now allows IP number and hostname for the @code{--bind-address}
option.
@item
Added @code{SET CHARACTER SET cp1251_koi8} to enable conversions of
data to and from the @code{cp1251_koi8} character set.
@item
Lots of changes for Windows 95 port. In theory, this version should now be
easily portable to Windows 95.
@item
Changed the @code{CREATE COLUMN} syntax of @code{NOT NULL} columns to be after
the @code{DEFAULT} value, as specified in the standard SQL standard. This will
make @code{mysqldump} with @code{NOT NULL} and default values incompatible with
MySQL 3.20.
@item
Added many function name aliases so the functions can be used with
ODBC or standard SQL syntax.
@item
Fixed syntax of @code{ALTER TABLE tbl_name ALTER COLUMN col_name SET DEFAULT
NULL}.
@item
Added @code{CHAR} and @code{BIT} as synonyms for @code{CHAR(1)}.
@item
Fixed core dump when updating as a user who has only @code{SELECT} privilege.
@item
@code{INSERT ... SELECT ... GROUP BY} didn't work in some cases. An
@code{Invalid use of group function} error occurred.
@item
When using @code{LIMIT}, @code{SELECT} now always uses keys instead of record
scan.  This will give better performance on @code{SELECT} and a @code{WHERE}
that matches many rows.
@item
Added Russian error messages.

MySQL now works with the new thread library on BSD/OS 3.0.
@item

@item
Added compatibility functions @code{CHECK} and @code{REFERENCES}.
@code{CHECK} is now a reserved word.
@item
Added @code{ALL} option to @code{GRANT} for better compatibility. (@code{GRANT}

@item
Fixed bug in @code{ORDER BY} and @code{GROUP BY} with @code{NULL} columns.

@code{CREATE} now supports all ODBC types and the @code{mSQL} @code{TEXT} type.
All ODBC 2.5 functions are also supported (added @code{REPEAT}). This provides
better portability.
@item
Added text types @code{TINYTEXT}, @code{TEXT}, @code{MEDIUMTEXT} and
@code{LONGTEXT}.  These are actually @code{BLOB} types, but all searching is
done in case-insensitive fashion.
@item
All old @code{BLOB} fields are now @code{TEXT} fields.  This only
changes that all searching on strings is done in case-sensitive fashion.
You must do an @code{ALTER TABLE} and change the data type to @code{BLOB}
if you want to have tests done in case-sensitive fashion.
@item
Fixed some @code{configure} issues.

@item
Fixed some possible buffer overflows if filenames that are too long are used.
@item
@code{mysqld} doesn't accept hostnames that start with digits followed by a
@code{'.'}, because the hostname may look like an IP number.
@item
Added @code{--skip-networking} option to @code{mysqld}, to allow only socket
connections.  (This will not work with MIT-pthreads!)
@item
Added check of too long table names for alias.
@item
Added check whether database name is okay.
@item

@item
Removed incorrect @code{free()} that killed the server on
@code{CREATE DATABASE} or @code{DROP DATABASE}.

Changed some @code{mysqld} @code{-O} options to better names.
@item
Added @code{-O join_cache_size=#} option to @code{mysqld}.
@item
Added @code{-O max_join_size=#} option to @code{mysqld}, to be able to set a
limit how big queries (in this case big = slow) one should be able to handle
without specifying @code{SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1}.  A # = is about 10
examined records. The default is ``unlimited.''
@item
When comparing a @code{TIME}, @code{DATE}, @code{DATETIME} or @code{TIMESTAMP}
column to a constant, the constant is converted to a time value before
performing the comparison.
This will make it easier to get ODBC (particularly Access97) to work with
these types. It should also make dates easier to use and the comparisons
should be quicker than before.
@item
Applied patch from Jochen Wiedmann that allows @code{query()} in
@code{mysqlperl} to take a query with @code{\0} in it.
@item
Storing a timestamp with a two-digit year (@code{YYMMDD}) didn't work.
@item
Fix that timestamp wasn't automatically updated if set in an @code{UPDATE}
clause.
@item
Now the automatic timestamp field is the FIRST timestamp field.
@item
@code{SELECT * INTO OUTFILE}, which didn't correctly if the outfile already
existed.

Many small portability changes (from the AIX and alpha-digital port)
Better checking of pthread(s) library.
@item
czech error messages by @email{snajdr@@pvt.net}.
@item
Decreased size of some buffers to get fewer problems on systems with little
memory.  Also added more checks to handle ``out of memory'' problems.
@item
@code{mysqladmin}: you can now do @code{mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8} to kill
multiple threads.
@item
When the maximum connection limit is reached, one extra connection by a user
with the @strong{process_acl} privilege is granted.
@item
Added @code{-O backlog=#} option to @code{mysqld}.

Increased maximum packet size from 512KB to 1024KB for client.
@item
Almost all of the function code is now tested in the internal test suite.
@item
@code{ALTER TABLE} now returns warnings from field conversions.
@item
Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).
@item
Added a fix for Visual FoxBase so that any schema name from a table
specification is automatically removed.
@item
New function @code{ASCII()}.
@item
Removed function @code{BETWEEN(a,b,c)}. Use the standard SQL
syntax instead: @code{expr BETWEEN expr AND expr}.
@item
MySQL no longer has to use an extra temporary table when sorting
on functions or @code{SUM()} functions.
@item
Fixed bug that you couldn't use @code{tbl_name.field_name} in @code{UPDATE}.
@item
Fixed @code{SELECT DISTINCT} when using 'hidden group'. For example:
@example
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test

@item
New command @code{EXPLAIN SELECT ...} to get information about how the

@item
For easier client code, the client should no longer use
@code{FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB}, @code{FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB},
@code{FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB} or @code{FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING} (as
previously returned by @code{mysql_list_fields}).  You should instead use only
@code{FIELD_TYPE_BLOB} or @code{FIELD_TYPE_STRING}.  If you want exact
types, you should use the command @code{SHOW FIELDS}.
@item
Added varbinary syntax: @code{0x######} which can be used as a string
(default) or a number.
@item
@code{FIELD_TYPE_CHAR} is renamed to @code{FIELD_TYPE_TINY}.
@item
Changed all fields to C++ classes.
@item
Removed FORM struct.
@item
Fields with @code{DEFAULT} values no longer need to be @code{NOT NULL}.
@item
New field types:
@table @code
@item ENUM
A string which can take only a couple of defined values. The value is
stored as a 1-3 byte number that is mapped automatically to a string.
This is sorted according to string positions!
@item SET
A string which may have one or many string values separated by ','.
The string is stored as a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-byte number where each bit stands
for a specific set member.  This is sorted according to the unsigned value
of the stored packed number.
@end table
@item
Now all function calculation is done with @code{double} or @code{long long}.
This will provide the full 64-bit range with bit functions and fix some
conversions that previously could result in precision losses.  One should
avoid using @code{unsigned long long} columns with full 64-bit range
(numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because calculations are done
with @code{signed long long}.
@item
@code{ORDER BY} will now put @code{NULL} field values first. @code{GROUP BY}
will also work with @code{NULL} values.
@item
Full @code{WHERE} with expressions.
@item
New range optimizer that can resolve ranges when some keypart prefix is
constant. Example:
@example
mysql> SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    ->          WHERE key_part_1="customer"
    ->          AND key_part_2>=10 AND key_part_2<=10;

Added @code{-p#} (remove @code{#} directories from path) to @code{isamlog}.
All files are written with a relative path from the database directory
Now @code{mysqld} shouldn't crash on shutdown when using the
@code{--log-isam} option.
@item
New @code{mysqlperl} version. It is now compatible with @code{msqlperl-0.63}.
@item
New @code{DBD} module available.
@item
Added group function @code{STD()} (standard deviation).
@item
The @code{mysqld} server is now compiled by default without debugging
information.  This will make the daemon smaller and faster.
@item
Now one usually only has to specify the @code{--basedir} option to
@code{mysqld}. All other paths are relative in a normal installation.
@item
@code{BLOB} columns sometimes contained garbage when used with a @code{SELECT}
on more than one table and @code{ORDER BY}.
@item
Fixed that calculations that are not in @code{GROUP BY} work as expected
(standard SQL extension).
Example:
@example
mysql> SELECT id,id+1 FROM table GROUP BY id;
@end example
@item
The test of using @code{MYSQL_PWD} was reversed. Now @code{MYSQL_PWD} is
enabled as default in the default release.
@item
Fixed conversion bug which caused @code{mysqld} to core dump with
Arithmetic error on SPARC-386.

@item
All communication packets and row buffers are now allocated dynamically
on demand. The default value of @code{max_allowed_packet} is now 64KB for
the server and 512KB for the client. This is mainly used to catch
incorrect packets that could trash all memory. The server limit may be

@item
The @code{ELT()} function is renamed to @code{FIELD()}.  The new
@code{ELT()} function returns a value based on an index: @code{FIELD()}
is the inverse of @code{ELT()} Example: @code{ELT(2,"A","B","C")} returns
@code{"B"}. @code{FIELD("B","A","B","C")} returns @code{2}.

@item
Added new field @code{File_priv} to @code{mysql/user} table.
@item
New script @code{add_file_priv} which adds the new field @code{File_priv}
to the @code{user} table. This script must be executed if you want to
use the new @code{SELECT ... INTO} and @code{LOAD DATA INFILE ...} commands
with a version of MySQL earlier than 3.20.7.

Portable to more systems because of MIT-pthreads, which will
be used automatically if @code{configure} cannot find a @code{-lpthreads}
library.
@item
Added GNU-style long options to almost all programs. Test with
@code{@kbd{program} --help}.
@item
Some shared library support for Linux.
@item
The FAQ is now in @file{.texi} format and is available in @file{.html},
@file{.txt} and @file{.ps} formats.
@item
Added new SQL function @code{RAND([init])}.
@item
Changed @code{sql_lex} to handle @code{\0} unquoted, but the client can't send
the query through the C API, because it takes a str pointer.
You must use @code{mysql_real_query()} to send the query.
@item
Added API function @code{mysql_get_client_info()}.
@item
@code{mysqld} now uses the @code{N_MAX_KEY_LENGTH} from @file{nisam.h} as
the maximum allowable key length.
@item
The following now works:
@example
mysql> SELECT filter_nr,filter_nr FROM filter ORDER BY filter_nr;
@end example
Previously, this resulted in the error:
@code{Column: 'filter_nr' in order clause is ambiguous}.
@item
@code{mysql} now outputs @code{'\0'}, @code{'\t'}, @code{'\n'} and @code{'\\'}
when encountering ASCII 0, tab, newline, or @code{'\'} while writing
tab-separated output.
This is to allow printing of binary data in a portable format.
To get the old behavior, use @code{-r} (or @code{--raw}).
@item
Added german error messages (60 of 80 error messages translated).
@item
Added new API function @code{mysql_fetch_lengths(MYSQL_RES *)}, which
returns an array of column lengths (of type @code{uint}).
@item
Fixed bug with @code{IS NULL} in @code{WHERE} clause.
@item
Changed the optimizer a little to get better results when searching on a key
part.
@item
Added @code{SELECT} option @code{STRAIGHT_JOIN} to tell the optimizer that
it should join tables in the given order.
@item
Added support for comments starting with @code{'--'} in @file{mysql.cc}
(Postgres syntax).
@item
You can have @code{SELECT} expressions and table columns in a @code{SELECT}
which are not used in the group part. This makes it efficient to implement
lookups.  The column that is used should be a constant for each group because
the value is calculated only once for the first row that is found for a group.
@example
mysql> SELECT id,lookup.text,SUM(*) FROM test,lookup
    ->        WHERE test.id=lookup.id GROUP BY id;
@end example
@item
Fixed bug in @code{SUM(function)} (could cause a core dump).
@item
Changed @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} placement in the SQL query:
@example
INSERT INTO table (auto_field) VALUES (0);
@end example
inserted 0, but it should insert an @code{AUTO_INCREMENT} value.
@item
@file{mysqlshow.c}: Added number of records in table. Had to change the
client code a little to fix this.
@item
@code{mysql} now allows doubled @code{''} or @code{""} within strings for
embedded @code{'} or @code{"}.
@item
New math functions:
@code{EXP()}, @code{LOG()}, @code{SQRT()}, @code{ROUND()}, @code{CEILING()}.

@appendixsubsec Changes in release 3.20.3

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{configure} source now compiles a thread-free client library
@code{-lmysqlclient}. This is the only library that needs to be linked
with client applications.  When using the binary releases, you must
link with @code{-lmysql -lmysys -ldbug -lmystrings} as before.
@item
New @code{readline} library from @code{bash-2.0}.
@item
LOTS of small changes to @code{configure} and makefiles (and related source).
@item
It should now be possible to compile in another directory using
@code{VPATH}. Tested with GNU Make 3.75.
@item
@code{safe_mysqld} and @code{mysql.server} changed to be more compatible
between the source and the binary releases.
@item
@code{LIMIT} now takes one or two numeric arguments.
If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows in
a result. If two arguments are given, the first argument indicates the offset
of the first row to return, the second is the maximum number of rows.
With this it's easy to do a poor man's next page/previous page WWW
application.
@item
Changed name of SQL function @code{FIELDS()} to @code{ELT()}.
Changed SQL function @code{INTERVALL()} to @code{INTERVAL()}.
@item
Made @code{SHOW COLUMNS} a synonym for @code{SHOW FIELDS}.
Added compatibility syntax @code{FRIEND KEY} to @code{CREATE TABLE}. In
MySQL, this creates a non-unique key on the given columns.
@item
Added @code{CREATE INDEX} and @code{DROP INDEX} as compatibility functions.
In MySQL, @code{CREATE INDEX} only checks if the index exists and
issues an error if it doesn't exist. @code{DROP INDEX} always succeeds.
@item
@file{mysqladmin.c}: added client version to version information.
@item
Fixed core dump bug in @code{sql_acl} (core on new connection).
@item
Removed @code{host}, @code{user} and @code{db} tables from database @code{test}
in the distribution.
@item
@code{FIELD_TYPE_CHAR} can now be signed (-128 to 127) or unsigned (0 to 255)
Previously, it was always unsigned.
@item
Bug fixes in @code{CONCAT()} and @code{WEEKDAY()}.
@item
Changed a lot of source to get @code{mysqld} to be compiled with SunPro
compiler.
@item
SQL functions must now have a @code{'('} immediately after the function name
(no intervening space).
For example, @code{'USER('} is regarded as beginning a function call, and
@code{'USER ('} is regarded as an identifier @code{USER} followed by a
@code{'('}, not as a function call.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The source distribution is done with @code{configure} and Automake.
It will make porting much easier.  The @code{readline} library is included
in the distribution.
@item
Separate client compilation:
the client code should be very easy to compile on systems which
don't have threads.
@item
The old Perl interface code is automatically compiled and installed.
Automatic compiling of @code{DBD} will follow when the new @code{DBD} code
is ported.
@item
Dynamic language support: @code{mysqld} can now be started with Swedish
or English (default) error messages.
@item
New functions: @code{INSERT()}, @code{RTRIM()}, @code{LTRIM()} and
@code{FORMAT()}.
@item
@code{mysqldump} now works correctly for all field types (even
@code{AUTO_INCREMENT}). The format for @code{SHOW FIELDS FROM tbl_name}
is changed so the @code{Type} column contains information suitable for
@code{CREATE TABLE}.  In previous releases, some @code{CREATE TABLE}
information had to be patched when re-creating tables.
@item
Some parser bugs from 3.19.5 (@code{BLOB} and @code{TIMESTAMP}) are corrected.
@code{TIMESTAMP} now returns different date information depending on its
create length.
@item
Changed parser to allow a database, table or field name to
start with a number or @code{'_'}.
@item
All old C code from Unireg changed to C++ and cleaned up. This makes
the daemon a little smaller and easier to understand.
@item
A lot of small bug fixes done.
@item
New @file{INSTALL} files (not final version) and some information regarding porting.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Do not allow dropping a table referenced by a @code{FOREIGN KEY}
constraint, unless the user does @code{SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0}.
The error message here is somewhat misleading
``Cannot delete or update a parent row...'', and must be changed in a
future version 4.1.x.
@item
Make @code{InnoDB} to remember the @code{CONSTRAINT} name given by a user for
a @code{FOREIGN KEY}.
@item
Change the print format of @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraints spanning
multiple databases to @code{`db_name`.`tbl_name`}. But when
parsing them, we must also accept @code{`db_name.tbl_name`},
because that was the output format in < 4.0.18.
@item
An optimization in locking: If @code{AUTOCOMMIT=1}, then we do not
need to make a plain @code{SELECT} set shared locks even on the
@code{SERIALIZABLE} isolation level, because we know that the
transaction is read-only. A read-only transaction can always be
performed on the @code{REPEATABLE READ} level, and that does not
endanger the serializability.
@item
Implement an automatic downgrade from >= 4.1.1 -> 4.0.18 if the user
has not created tables in @file{.ibd} files or used other 4.1.x
features. @strong{Consult} the manual section on
@strong{multiple tablespaces} carefully if you want to downgrade!
@item
Fixed a bug: MySQL should not allow @code{REPLACE} to internally
perform an @code{UPDATE} if the table is referenced by a
@code{FOREIGN KEY}. The MySQL manual states that @code{REPLACE} must
resolve a duplicate-key error semantically with
@code{DELETE}(s) + @code{INSERT}, and not by an @code{UPDATE}.
In versions < 4.0.18 and < 4.1.2, MySQL could resolve a duplicate key
conflict in @code{REPLACE} by doing an @code{UPDATE} on the existing
row, and @code{FOREIGN KEY} checks could behave in a semantically
wrong way. (Bug #2418)
@item
Fixed a bug: generate @code{FOREIGN KEY} constraint identifiers
locally for each table, in the form
@code{db_name/tbl_name_ibfk_number}. If the user gives the
constraint name explicitly, then remember it. These changes should
ensure that foreign key id's in a slave are the same as in the master,
and @code{DROP FOREIGN KEY} does not break replication. (Bug #2167)
@item
Fixed a bug: allow quoting of identifiers in InnoDB's
@code{FOREIGN KEY} definitions with a backquote (`) and a double quote
("). You can now use also spaces in table and column names, if you
quote the identifiers. (Bug #1725) and (Bug #2424)
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{FOREIGN KEY ... ON UPDATE/DELETE NO ACTION} must
check the foreign key constraint, not ignore it. Since we do not have
deferred constraints in @code{InnoDB}, this bug fix makes @code{InnoDB} to check
@code{NO ACTION} constraints immediately, like it checks
@code{RESTRICT} constraints.
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{InnoDB} crashed in @code{RENAME TABLE} if 
@code{'db_name.tbl_name'} is shorter than 5 characters.
(Bug #2689)
@item
Fixed a bug: in @code{SHOW TABLE STATUS}, @code{InnoDB} row count and index
cardinality estimates wrapped around at 512 million in 32-bit
computers. Note that unless MySQL is compiled with the
@code{BIG_TABLES} option, they will still wrap around at 4 billion.
@item
Fixed a bug: If there was a @code{UNIQUE} secondary index, and
@code{NULL} values in that unique index, then with the
@code{IS NULL} predicate, @code{InnoDB} returned only the first matching row,
though there can be many.
This bug was introduced in 4.0.16. (Bug #2483)

@item
Fixed a bug: If you created a column prefix secondary index and updated it
so that the last characters in the column prefix were spaces, @code{InnoDB} would
assert in @file{row0upd.c}, line 713. The same assertion failed if you
updated a column in an ordinary secondary index so that the new value was
alphabetically equivalent, but had a different length. This could happen,
for example, in the UTF8 character set if you updated a letter to its
accented or umlaut form. 
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{InnoDB} could think that a secondary index record was not
locked though it had been updated to an alphabetically equivalent value,
e.g., 'abc' -> 'aBc'. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If you updated a secondary index column to an alphabetically
equivalent value, and rolled back your update, @code{InnoDB} failed to restore
the field in the secondary index to its original value. 
@item
There are still several outstanding non-critical bugs reported in the MySQL
bugs database. Their fixing has been delayed, because resources were

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fixed a bug: If you updated a row so that the 8000 byte maximum length
(without @code{BLOB} and @code{TEXT}) was exceeded, @code{InnoDB} simply removed
the record from the clustered index. In a similar insert, @code{InnoDB} would
leak reserved file space extents, which would only be freed at the next
@code{mysqld} startup. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If you used big @code{BLOB} values, and your log files were
relatively small, @code{InnoDB} could in a big @code{BLOB} operation temporarily
write over the log produced after the latest checkpoint. If @code{InnoDB}
would crash at that moment, then the crash recovery would fail,
because @code{InnoDB} would not be able to scan the log even up to the
latest checkpoint. Starting from this version, @code{InnoDB} tries to ensure
the latest checkpoint is young enough. If that is not possible,
@code{InnoDB} prints a warning to the @file{.err} log of MySQL and advises
you to make the log files bigger. 
@item
Fixed a bug: setting @code{innodb_fast_shutdown=0} had no effect. 
@item
Fixed a bug introduced in 4.0.13: If a @code{CREATE TABLE} ended in a
comment, that could cause a memory overrun. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If @code{InnoDB} printed @code{Operating system error number .. in
a file operation} to the @file{.err} log in Windows, the error number
explanation was wrong. Workaround: look at section 13.2 of
http://www.innodb.com/ibman.php about Windows
error numbers.
@item
Fixed a bug: If you created a column prefix
@code{PRIMARY KEY} like in @code{t(a CHAR(200), PRIMARY KEY (a(10)))}
on a fixed-length @code{CHAR} column, @code{InnoDB} would crash even in a
simple @code{SELECT}. A @code{CHECK TABLE} would report the table as
corrupt, also in the case where the created key was not @code{PRIMARY}.

@itemize bullet
@item
@code{InnoDB} now supports the @code{SAVEPOINT} and @code{ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT}
SQL statements. See http://www.innodb.com/ibman.php#Savepoints for
the syntax.
@item
You can now create column prefix keys like in
@code{CREATE TABLE t (a BLOB, INDEX (a(10)))}.
@item
You can also use @code{O_DIRECT} as the @code{innodb_flush_method} on the
latest versions of Linux and FreeBSD. Beware of possible bugs in those
operating systems, though. 
@item
Fixed the checksum calculation of data pages. Previously most OS file
system corruption went unnoticed. Note that if you downgrade from
version >= 4.0.14 to an earlier version < 4.0.14 then in the first
startup(s) @code{InnoDB} will print warnings: 
@example
InnoDB: Warning: An inconsistent page in the doublewrite buffer
InnoDB: space id 2552202359 page number 8245, 127'th page in dblwr buf.
@end example
but that is not dangerous and can be ignored. 
@item
Modified the buffer pool replacement algorithm so that it tries to
flush modified pages if there are no replaceable pages in the last
10 % of the LRU list. This can reduce disk I/O if the workload is
a mixture of reads and writes. 
@item
The buffer pool checkpoint flush algorithm now tries to flush also
close neighbors of the page at the end of the flush list. This can
speed up database shutdown, and can also speed up disk writes if
@code{InnoDB} log files are very small compared to the buffer pool size. 
@item
In 4.0.13 we made @code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} to print detailed info
on the latest @code{UNIQUE KEY} error, but storing that info could
slow down @code{REPLACE} significantly. We no longer store or print
the info. 
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0} was not replicated properly
in the MySQL replication. The fix will not be backported to 3.23. 
@item
Fixed a bug: the parameter @code{innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct} forgot to
take into account the free pages in the buffer pool. This could lead
to excessive flushing even though there were lots of free pages in
the buffer pool. Workaround: @code{SET GLOBAL
innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 100}.
@item
Fixed a bug: If there were big index scans then a file read request
could starve and @code{InnoDB} could assert because of a very long semaphore wait. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If @code{AUTOCOMMIT=1} then inside @code{LOCK TABLES} MySQL
failed to do the commit after an updating SQL statement if binary logging was
not on, and for @code{SELECT} statements did not commit regardless of binary logging state. 
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{InnoDB} could make the index page directory corrupt in the
first B-tree page splits after a @code{mysqld} startup. A symptom would be an
assertion in page0page.c, in function page_dir_find_slot(). 
@item
Fixed a bug: If in a @code{FOREIGN KEY} with an @code{UPDATE CASCADE}
clause the parent column was of a different internal storage length
than the child column, then a cascaded update would make the column
length wrong in the child table and corrupt the child table. Because
of MySQL's 'silent column specification changes' a fixed-length
@code{CHAR} column can change internally to a @code{VARCHAR} and cause
this error. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If a non-@code{latin1} character set was used and if in a
@code{FOREIGN KEY} the parent column was of a different internal storage
length than the child column, then all inserts to the child table would
fail in a foreign key error. 
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{InnoDB} could complain that it cannot find the clustered
index record, or in rare cases return an extraneous row if a rollback,
purge, and a @code{SELECT} coincided. 
@item
Fixed a possible hang over the btr0sea.c latch if @code{SELECT} was used
inside @code{LOCK TABLES}. 
@item
Fixed a bug: contrary to what the release note of 4.0.13 said, the
group commit still did not work if the MySQL binary logging was on. 
@item
Fixed a bug: os_event_wait() did not work properly in Unix, which
might have caused starvation in various log operations. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If a single @code{DELETE} statement first managed to delete
some rows and then failed in a @code{FOREIGN KEY} error or a
'Table is full error', MySQL did not roll back the whole SQL statement
as it should, and also wrote the failed statement to the binary log, reporting
there a non-zero error_code. 
@item
Fixed a bug: the maximum allowed number of columns in a table is 1000, but
@code{InnoDB} did not check that limit in @code{CREATE TABLE}, and a subsequent
@code{INSERT} or @code{SELECT} from that table could cause an assertion.

Changed the default value of @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit} from 0
to 1. If you have not specified it explicitly in your @file{my.cnf}, and
your application runs much slower with this new release, it is because the

@item
Fixed a bug: @code{InnoDB} forgot to call pthread_mutex_destroy() when a table was
dropped. That could cause memory leakage on FreeBSD and other non-Linux
Unixes. 
@item
Fixed a bug: MySQL could erroneously return 'Empty set' if @code{InnoDB} estimated
an index range size to 0 records though the range was not empty; MySQL also

@item
@code{SHOW INNODB STATUS} now prints detailed information of the latest
detected @code{FOREIGN KEY} and @code{UNIQUE KEY} errors. If you do not understand
why @code{InnoDB} gives the error 150 from a @code{CREATE TABLE}, you can use
this statement to study the reason. 
@item
@code{ANALYZE TABLE} now works also for @code{InnoDB} type tables. It makes 10
random dives to each of the index trees and updates index cardinality
estimates accordingly. Note that since it is only an estimate,
repeated runs of @code{ANALYZE TABLE} may produce different numbers. MySQL
uses index cardinality estimates only in join optimization. If some
join is not optimized in the right way, you may try using @code{ANALYZE TABLE}. 
@item
@code{InnoDB} group commit capability now works also when MySQL
binary logging is switched on. There have to be > 2 client threads
for the group commit to become active. 
@item
Changed the default value of @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit} from
0 to 1. If you have not specified it explicitly in your @file{my.cnf},
and your application runs much slower with this new release, it
is because the value 1 causes a log flush to disk at each transaction
commit. 
@item
Added a new global settable MySQL system variable
@code{innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct}. It is an integer in the range 0 - 100.
The default is 90. The main thread in @code{InnoDB} tries to flush pages
from the buffer pool so that at most this many percents are not yet
flushed at any time. 
@item
If @code{innodb_force_recovery=6}, do not let @code{InnoDB} do repair of corrupt
pages based on the doublewrite buffer. 
@item
@code{InnoDB} startup now happens faster because it does not set the
memory in the buffer pool to zero. 
@item
Fixed a bug: The @code{InnoDB} parser for @code{FOREIGN KEY} definitions was
confused by the keywords 'foreign key' inside MySQL comments. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If you dropped a table to which there was a @code{FOREIGN
KEY} reference, and later created the same table with non-matching
column types, @code{InnoDB} could assert in @file{dict0load.c}, in function
@code{dict_load_table()}. 
@item
Fixed a bug: @code{GROUP BY} and @code{DISTINCT} could treat @code{NULL}
values as not equal.
MySQL also failed to do the next-key locking in the case of an
empty index range. 
@item
Fixed a bug: Do not commit the current transaction when a @code{MyISAM}
table is updated; this also makes @code{CREATE TABLE} not to commit an
@code{InnoDB} transaction, even when binary logging is enabled. 
@item
Fixed a bug: We did not allow @code{ON DELETE SET NULL} to modify the same
table where the delete was made; we can allow it because that cannot
produce infinite loops in cascaded operations. 
@item
Fixed a bug: Allow @code{HANDLER PREV} and @code{NEXT} also after positioning
the cursor with a unique search on the primary key.
@item
Fixed a bug: If @code{MIN()} or @code{MAX()} resulted in a deadlock or a lock
wait timeout, MySQL did not return an error, but returned @code{NULL} as the

@item
Tables and indexes now reserve 4 % less space in the tablespace.
Also existing tables reserve less space. By upgrading to 4.0.8
you will see more free space in "InnoDB free" in SHOW TABLE STATUS. 
@item
Fixed bugs: updating the PRIMARY KEY of a row would generate a
foreign key error on all FOREIGN KEYs which referenced secondary
keys of the row to be updated. Also, if a referencing
FOREIGN KEY constraint only referenced the first columns in an
index, and there were more columns in that index, updating the
additional columns generated a foreign key error. 
@item
Fixed a bug: If an index contains some column twice, and that

The feature set of 3.23 will be frozen from this version on. New features

branch.
@item
Many CPU-bound join queries now run faster. On Windows also many
other CPU-bound queries run faster.
@item
A new SQL command SHOW INNODB STATUS returns the output of the
@code{InnoDB} Monitor to the client. The @code{InnoDB} Monitor now prints detailed
information on
the latest detected deadlock.
@item
@code{InnoDB} made the SQL query optimizer to avoid too much index-only
range scans and choose full table scans instead. This is now fixed.
@item
@code{BEGIN} and @code{COMMIT} are now added in the binary log around transactions.
The MySQL replication now respects transaction borders:
a user will no longer see half transactions in replication slaves.
@item
A replication slave now prints in crash recovery the last
master binary log position it was able to recover to.
@item
A new setting @code{innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2} makes @code{InnoDB} to write
the log to the operating system file cache at each commit. This is
almost as fast as the setting innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0, and
the setting 2 also has the nice feature that in a crash where the
operating system does not crash, no committed transaction is lost.
If the operating system crashes or there is a power outage, then
the setting 2 is no safer than the setting 0.
@item
Added checksum fields to log blocks.
@item
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 helps in importing tables
in an arbitrary order which does not respect the foreign key rules.
@item
SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0 speeds up table imports into @code{InnoDB}
if you have UNIQUE constraints on secondary indexes.
This flag should be used only if you are certain that the input records
contain no UNIQUE constraint violations.
@item
SHOW TABLE STATUS now lists also possible ON DELETE CASCADE or
ON DELETE SET NULL in the comment field of the table.
@item
When CHECK TABLE is run on any @code{InnoDB} type table, it now
checks also the adaptive hash index for all tables.
@item
If you defined ON DELETE CASCADE or SET NULL and updated the
referenced key in the parent row, @code{InnoDB} deleted or updated
the child row. This is now changed to conform to standard SQL: you get
the error 'Cannot delete parent row'.
@item
Improved the auto-increment algorithm: now the first insert or
SHOW TABLE STATUS initializes the auto-increment counter for the table.
This removes almost all surprising deadlocks caused by
SHOW TABLE STATUS.
@item
Aligned some buffers used in reading and writing to data files.
This allows using unbuffered raw devices as data files in Linux.
@item
Fixed a bug: If you updated the primary key of a table so that only the
case of characters changed, that could cause assertion
failures, mostly in page0page.ic line 515.
@item
Fixed a bug: If you delete or update a row referenced in a foreign key
constraint and the foreign key check has to wait for a lock,
then the check may report an erroneous result. This
affects also the ON DELETE... operation.
@item
Fixed a bug: A deadlock or a lock wait timeout error in @code{InnoDB}
causes @code{InnoDB} to roll back the whole transaction, but MySQL could still
write the earlier SQL statements to the binary log, even though
@code{InnoDB} rolled them back. This could, for example, cause replicated
databases to get out-of-sync.
@item
Fixed a bug: If the database happened to crash in the middle of a
commit, then the recovery might leak tablespace pages.
@item
Fixed a bug: If you specified a non-latin1 character set in my.cnf,
then, in contrary to what is stated in the manual, in a foreign key
constraint a string type column had to have the same length specification
in the referencing table and the referenced table.
@item
Fixed a bug: DROP TABLE or DROP DATABASE could fail if there
simultaneously was a CREATE TABLE running.
@item
Fixed a bug: If you configured the buffer pool bigger than 2GB in
a 32-bit computer, @code{InnoDB} would assert in buf0buf.ic line 214.
@item
Fixed a bug: on 64-bit computers updating rows which contained the
SQL NULL in some column could cause the undo log and the ordinary
log to become corrupt.
@item
Fixed a bug: innodb_log_monitor caused a hang if it suppressed
lock prints for a page.
@item
Fixed a bug: in the HP-UX-10.20 version mutexes would leak and cause
race conditions and crashes in any part of @code{InnoDB} code.

@code{InnoDB} now supports an auto-extending last data file. You do not need

@item
Made several changes to facilitate the use of the @code{InnoDB Hot Backup}
tool. It is a separate non-free tool you can use to take online backups
of your database without shutting down the server or setting
any locks.
@item
If you want to run the @code{InnoDB Hot Backup} tool on an auto-extending
data file you have to upgrade it to version ibbackup-0.35.
@item
The log scan phase in crash recovery will now run much faster.
@item
Starting from this server version, the hot backup tool
truncates unused ends in the backup @code{InnoDB} data files.
@item
To allow the hot backup tool to work, on Windows we no longer use
unbuffered I/O or native async I/O; instead we use the same simulated
async I/O as on Unix.
@item
You can now define the ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL
clause on foreign keys.
@item
FOREIGN KEY constraints now survive ALTER TABLE and CREATE
INDEX.
@item
We suppress the FOREIGN KEY check if any of the column values in the
foreign key or referenced key to be checked is the SQL NULL. This
is compatible with Oracle, for example.
@item
SHOW CREATE TABLE now lists also foreign key constraints. Also
mysqldump no longer forgets about foreign keys in table definitions.
@item
You can now add a new foreign key constraint with
ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... (...).
@item
FOREIGN KEY definitions now allow backquotes around table and
column names.
@item
MySQL command
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...
has now the following effect on
@code{InnoDB} tables: If a transaction is defined as SERIALIZABLE
then @code{InnoDB} conceptually adds LOCK IN SHARE MODE
to all consistent reads. If a transaction is defined to have any other
isolation level, then @code{InnoDB} obeys its default locking strategy
which is REPEATABLE READ.
@item
SHOW TABLE STATUS no longer sets an x-lock at the end of an
auto-increment index if the auto-increment counter has already
been initialized. This removes in almost all cases the surprising deadlocks

Large CPU-bound SELECT queries will now also generally run faster on
all platforms.
@item
If MySQL binary logging is used,
@code{InnoDB} now prints after crash recovery the latest MySQL binary log
file name and the position in that file (= byte offset)
@code{InnoDB} was able to recover to. This is useful, for example,
when resynchronizing a master and a slave database in replication.
@item
Added better error messages to help in installation problems.
@item
One can now recover also MySQL temporary tables which have become
orphaned inside the @code{InnoDB} tablespace.
@item
@code{InnoDB} now prevents a FOREIGN KEY declaration where the signedness
is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
@item
Fixed a bug: calling SHOW CREATE TABLE or SHOW TABLE STATUS
could cause memory corruption and make @code{mysqld} to crash.
Especially at risk was mysqldump, because it calls frequently
SHOW CREATE TABLE.
@item
Fixed a bug: If on Unix you did an ALTER TABLE to an @code{InnoDB} table and
simultaneously did queries to it, @code{mysqld} could crash with an assertion

@item
@code{InnoDB} allows a FOREIGN KEY column of CHAR type to refer to a column of

Unnecessary statistics calculation has been removed from queries which

This is a bugfix release.
@item
In versions 3.23.42-.44 when creating a table on Windows, you
have to use lowercase letters in the database name to be able to
access the table. Fixed in 3.23.45.
@item
@code{InnoDB} now flushes stdout and stderr every 10 seconds: If these
are redirected to files, the file contents can be better viewed with
an editor.
@item
Fixed an assertion failure in .44, in trx0trx.c, line 178
when you drop a table which has
the .frm file but does not exist inside @code{InnoDB}.
@item
Fixed a bug in the insert buffer.
The insert buffer tree could get into an inconsistent state, causing a crash,
and also crashing the recovery. This bug could appear especially in
large table imports or alterations.
@item
Fixed a bug in recovery: @code{InnoDB} could go into an infinite loop
constantly printing
a warning message that it cannot find free blocks from the buffer pool.
@item
Fixed a bug: when you created a temporary table of the @code{InnoDB} type, and then
used ALTER TABLE to it, the MySQL server could crash.
@item
Prevented creation of MySQL system tables 'mysql.user',
'mysql.host', or 'mysql.db', in the
@code{InnoDB} type.
@item
Fixed a bug which can cause an assertion failure in 3.23.44 in

@item
You can define foreign key constraints on @code{InnoDB}
tables. An example: FOREIGN KEY (col1) REFERENCES table2(col2).
@item
You can create data files larger than 4GB in those
filesystems that allow it.
@item
Improved @code{InnoDB} monitors, including a new innodb_table_monitor
which allows you to print the contents of the @code{InnoDB} internal data
dictionary.
@item
DROP DATABASE will now work also for @code{InnoDB} tables.
@item
Accent characters in the default character set
latin1 will be ordered according to the MySQL ordering.<br>
NOTE: If you are using latin1 and have inserted characters
whose code is > 127 to an indexed CHAR column, you should run
CHECK TABLE on your table when you upgrade to
3.23.43, and drop and reimport the table if CHECK TABLE
reports an error!
@item
@code{InnoDB} will calculate better table cardinality
estimates.
@item
Change in deadlock resolution:
in .43 a deadlock rolls back only the
SQL statement, in .44 it will roll back the whole transaction.
@item
Deadlock, lock wait timeout, and foreign key
constraint violations (no parent row, child rows exist)
now return native MySQL
error codes 1213, 1205, 1216, 1217, respectively.

helps in performance tuning in high concurrency environments.
@item
A new my.cnf option innodb_force_recovery will
help you in dumping tables from a corrupted database.
@item
A new my.cnf option innodb_fast_shutdown will
speed up shutdown. Normally @code{InnoDB} does a full purge

@appendix Porting to Other Systems

@cindex porting, to other systems

This appendix will help you port MySQL to other operating systems.
Do check the list of currently supported operating systems first.
@xref{Which OS}.
If you have created a new port of MySQL, please let us know so that
we can list it here and on our Web site (@uref{http://www.mysql.com/}),
recommending it to other users.

Note: If you create a new port of MySQL, you are free to copy and
distribute it under the @code{GPL} license, but it does not make you a
copyright holder of MySQL.

A working POSIX thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions is not good enough), on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, @email{Xavier.Leroy@@inria.fr}.

The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
@file{mit-pthreads/README} and Programming POSIX Threads
(@uref{http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/}).

Up to MySQL 4.0.2, the MySQL distribution included a patched version of
Chris Provenzano's Pthreads from MIT (see the MIT Pthreads Web page at
@uref{http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/pthreads/} and a programming
introduction at @uref{http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/IAP_2000/}).
These can be used for some operating systems that do not have POSIX threads.
@xref{MIT-pthreads}.

It is also possible to use another user level thread package named
FSU Pthreads (see @uref{http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/pthreads/}).
This implementation is being used for the SCO port.

See the @file{thr_lock.c} and @file{thr_alarm.c} programs in the @file{mysys}
directory for some tests/examples of these problems.

Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler. We use @code{gcc}
on many platforms. Other compilers that are known to work are SPARCworks,
Sun Forte, Irix @code{cc}, HP-UX @code{aCC}, IBM AIX @code{xlC_r}), Intel
@code{ecc} and Compaq @code{cxx}).

To compile only the client use @code{./configure --without-server}.

There is currently no support for only compiling the server, nor is it
likly to be added unless someone has a good reason for it.

If you want/need to change any @file{Makefile} or the configure script you
will also need GNU Automake and Autoconf.
@xref{Installing source tree}.

All steps needed to remake everything from the most basic files.

@example
/bin/rm */.deps/*.P
/bin/rm -f config.cache
aclocal
autoheader
aclocal
automake
autoconf
./configure --with-debug=full --prefix='your installation directory'

# The makefiles generated above need GNU make 3.75 or newer.
# (called gmake below)
gmake clean all install init-db
@end example

If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some debugging
of MySQL!
@xref{Debugging server}.

@strong{Note:} Before you start debugging @code{mysqld}, first get the test
programs @code{mysys/thr_alarm} and @code{mysys/thr_lock} to work.  This
will ensure that your thread installation has even a remote chance to work!

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL,
you can try to run @code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-new} (which will disable all
new, potentially unsafe functionality) or with @code{--safe-mode} which
disables a lot of optimization that may cause problems.
@xref{Crashing}.

If @code{mysqld} doesn't want to start, you should verify that you don't have
any @file{my.cnf} files that interfere with your setup!
You can check your @file{my.cnf} arguments with @code{mysqld --print-defaults}
and avoid using them by starting with @code{mysqld --no-defaults ...}.

If @code{mysqld} starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it ``hangs,'' you
can use @code{mysqladmin processlist status} to find out if someone is
executing a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to
run @code{mysqladmin -i10 processlist status} in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't connect.

The command @code{mysqladmin debug} will dump some information about
locks in use, used memory and query usage to the MySQL log file. This
may help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimize the table with @code{OPTIMIZE TABLE} or
@code{myisamchk}.  @xref{MySQL Database Administration}. You should also
check the slow queries with @code{EXPLAIN}.

You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.

@node Compiling for debugging, Making trace files, Debugging server, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Compiling MySQL for Debugging

If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the
@code{--with-debug} or the @code{--with-debug=full} option.  You can check
whether MySQL was compiled with debugging by doing:
@code{mysqld --help}.  If the @code{--debug} flag is listed with the
options then you have debugging enabled.  @code{mysqladmin ver} also
lists the @code{mysqld} version as @code{mysql ... --debug} in this case.

If you are using @code{gcc} or @code{egcs}, the recommended @code{configure} line is:

@example
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors \
   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
   --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex
@end example

This will avoid problems with the @code{libstdc++} library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL
with @code{--with-debug=full}, which will install a memory allocation
(@code{SAFEMALLOC}) checker. However, running with @code{SAFEMALLOC} is
quite slow, so if you get performance problems you should start
@code{mysqld} with the @code{--skip-safemalloc} option. This will
disable the memory overrun checks for each call to @code{malloc()} and
@code{free()}.

If @code{mysqld} stops crashing when you compile it with
@code{--with-debug}, you have probably found a compiler bug or a timing
bug within MySQL.  In this case you can try to add @code{-g} to
the @code{CFLAGS} and @code{CXXFLAGS} variables above and not use
@code{--with-debug}. If @code{mysqld} now dies, you can at least attach
to it with @code{gdb} or use @code{gdb} on the core file to find out
what happened.

When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a
lot of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of @code{mysqld}.
If they find something ``unexpected,'' an entry will be written to
@code{stderr}, which @code{safe_mysqld} directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing is to
send mail to a MySQL mailing list and ask for help.
@xref{Mailing-list}.
Please use the
@code{mysqlbug} script for all bug reports or questions regarding the
MySQL version you are using!

In the Windows MySQL distribution, @code{mysqld.exe} is by
default compiled with support for trace files.


@node Making trace files, Using gdb on mysqld, Compiling for debugging, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Creating Trace Files

If the @code{mysqld} server doesn't start or if you can cause it
to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace file to find the problem.

To do this, you must have a @code{mysqld} that has been compiled with
debugging support.
You can check this by executing @code{mysqld -V}.  If the version number
ends with @code{-debug}, it's compiled with support for trace files.

Start the @code{mysqld} server with a trace log in @file{/tmp/mysqld.trace}
on Unix or @file{C:\mysqld.trace} on Windows:

@example
shell> mysqld --debug
@end example

On Windows, you should also use the @code{--standalone} flag to not start
@code{mysqld} as a service.  In a console window, use this command:

@example
C:\> mysqld --debug --standalone
@end example

After this, you can use the @code{mysql.exe} command-line tool in a
second console window to reproduce the problem. You can stop the
@code{mysqld} server with @code{mysqladmin shutdown}.

Note that the trace file will become @strong{very big}!
If you want to generate a smaller trace file, you can use debugging options
something like this:

@code{mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace}

This only prints information with the most interesting tags to the trace file.

If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
@uref{ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/} so that a MySQL
developer can take a look a this.

The trace file is made with the @strong{DBUG} package by Fred Fish.
@xref{The DBUG package}.


@node Using gdb on mysqld, Using stack trace, Making trace files, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Debugging @code{mysqld} under @code{gdb}

@cindex gdb, using

On most systems you can also start @code{mysqld} from @code{gdb} to get
more information if @code{mysqld} crashes.

With some older @code{gdb} versions on Linux you must use @code{run
--one-thread} if you want to be able to debug @code{mysqld} threads.  In
this case you can only have one thread active at a time.  We recommend you
to upgrade to gdb 5.1 ASAP as thread debugging works much better with this
version!

When running @code{mysqld} under gdb, you should disable the stack trace
with @code{--skip-stack-trace} to be able to catch segfaults within gdb.

In MySQL 4.0.14 and above you should use the @code{--gdb} option to
mysqld.  This will install an interrupt handler for @code{SIGINT} (needed
to stop @code{mysqld} with @code{^C} to set breakpoints) and disable stack
tracing and core file handling.

It's very hard to debug MySQL under @code{gdb} if you do a lot of
new connections the whole time as @code{gdb} doesn't free the memory for
old threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting @code{mysqld} with
@code{-O thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1'}.  In most cases just
using @code{-O thread_cache_size=5'} will help a lot!

If you want to get a core dump on Linux if @code{mysqld} dies with a
SIGSEGV signal, you can start @code{mysqld} with the @code{--core-file} option.
This core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you
find out why @code{mysqld} died:

@example
shell> gdb mysqld core
gdb>   backtrace full
gdb>   exit
@end example

@xref{Crashing}.

If you are using gdb 4.17.x or above on Linux, you should install a
@file{.gdb} file, with the following information, in your current
directory:

@example
set print sevenbit off
handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
handle SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
handle SIGWAITING nostop noprint
handle SIGLWP nostop noprint
handle SIGPIPE nostop
handle SIGALRM nostop
handle SIGHUP nostop
handle SIGTERM nostop noprint
@end example

If you have problems debugging threads with gdb, you should download
gdb 5.x and try this instead. The new gdb version has very improved
thread handling!

Here is an example how to debug mysqld:

@example
shell> gdb /usr/local/libexec/mysqld
gdb> run
...
backtrace full # Do this when mysqld crashes
@end example

Include the above output in a mail generated with @code{mysqlbug} and
mail this to the general MySQL mailing list.
@xref{Mailing-list}.

If @code{mysqld} hangs you can try to use some system tools like
@code{strace} or @code{/usr/proc/bin/pstack} to examine where
@code{mysqld} has hung.

@example
strace /tmp/log libexec/mysqld
@end example

@findex DBI->trace
@findex trace DBI method
@tindex DBI_TRACE environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, DBI_TRACE
If you are using the Perl @code{DBI} interface, you can turn on
debugging information by using the @code{trace} method or by
setting the @code{DBI_TRACE} environment variable.


@node Using stack trace, Using log files, Using gdb on mysqld, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Using a Stack Trace

On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace if
@code{mysqld} dies unexpectedly. You can use this to find out where (and
maybe why) @code{mysqld} died. @xref{Error log}.  To get a stack trace,
you must not compile @code{mysqld} with the @code{-fomit-frame-pointer}
option to gcc. @xref{Compiling for debugging}.

If the error file contains something like the following:

@example
mysqld got signal 11;
The manual section 'Debugging a MySQL server' tells you how to use a
stack trace and/or the core file to produce a readable backtrace that may
help in finding out why mysqld died
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died.  If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
stack range sanity check, ok, backtrace follows
0x40077552
0x81281a0
0x8128f47
0x8127be0

0x80ee4bc
0x80c3c91
0x80c6b43
0x80c1fd9
0x80c1686
@end example

you can find where @code{mysqld} died by doing the following:

@enumerate
@item
Copy the preceding numbers to a file, for example @file{mysqld.stack}.

@item
Make a symbol file for the @code{mysqld} server:
@example
nm -n libexec/mysqld > /tmp/mysqld.sym
@end example

Note that most MySQL binary distributions (except for the "debug" packages,
where this information is included inside of the binaries themselves)
already ship with the above file, named @code{mysqld.sym.gz}.
In this case you can simply unpack it by doing:

@example
gunzip < bin/mysqld.sym.gz > /tmp/mysqld.sym
@end example

@item
Execute @code{resolve_stack_dump -s /tmp/mysqld.sym -n mysqld.stack}.

This will print out where @code{mysqld} died. If this doesn't help you
find out why @code{mysqld} died, you should make a bug report and include
the output from the above command with the bug report.

Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a stack
trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to locate the bug
or provide a workaround, we would in most cases need to know the query
that killed @code{mysqld} and preferable a test case so that we can
repeat the problem!  @xref{Bug reports}.
@end enumerate


@node Using log files, Reproduceable test case, Using stack trace, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Using Log Files to Find Cause of Errors in @code{mysqld}

Note that before starting @code{mysqld} with @code{--log} you should
check all your tables with @code{myisamchk}.
@xref{MySQL Database Administration}.

If @code{mysqld} dies or hangs, you should start @code{mysqld} with
@code{--log}.  When @code{mysqld} dies again, you can examine the end of
the log file for the query that killed @code{mysqld}.

If you are using @code{--log} without a file name, the log is stored in
the database directory as 'hostname'.log In most cases it is the last
query in the log file that killed @code{mysqld}, but if possible you
should verify this by restarting @code{mysqld} and executing the found
query from the @code{mysql} command-line tools. If this works, you
should also test all complicated queries that didn't complete.

You can also try the command @code{EXPLAIN} on all @code{SELECT}
statements that takes a long time to ensure that @code{mysqld} is using
indexes properly. @xref{EXPLAIN, , @code{EXPLAIN}}.

You can find the queries that take a long time to execute by starting
@code{mysqld} with @code{--log-slow-queries}. @xref{Slow query log}.

If you find the text @code{mysqld restarted} in the error log file
(normally named @file{hostname.err}) you have probably found a query
that causes @code{mysqld} to fail.  If this happens, you should check all
your tables with @code{myisamchk} (@pxref{MySQL Database Administration}),
and test the queries in the MySQL log files to see if one doesn't
work.  If you find such a query, try first upgrading to the newest
MySQL version.  If this doesn't help and you can't find anything
in the @code{mysql} mail archive, you should report the bug to a MySQL
mailing list.
The mailing lists are described at
@uref{http://lists.mysql.com/}, which also has links to online
list archives.

If you have started @code{mysqld} with @code{myisam-recover},
MySQL will automatically check and try to repair @code{MyISAM}
tables if they are marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If
this happens, MySQL will write an entry in the
@code{hostname.err} file @code{'Warning: Checking table ...'} which is
followed by @code{Warning: Repairing table} if the table needs to be
repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without @code{mysqld} having
died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong and needs to
be investigated further. @xref{Server options}.

It's not a good sign if @code{mysqld} did died unexpectedly,
but in this case one shouldn't investigate the @code{Checking table...}
messages but instead try to find out why @code{mysqld} died.


@node Reproduceable test case,  , Using log files, Debugging server
@appendixsubsec Making a Test Case If You Experience Table Corruption

If you get corrupted tables or if @code{mysqld} always fails after some
update commands, you can test whether this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Take down the MySQL daemon (with @code{mysqladmin shutdown}).
@item
Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely case that
the repair will do something bad).

wrong tables with @code{myisamchk -r database/table.MYI}.
@item
Make a second backup of the tables.
@item
Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
directory if you need more space.

@appendixsec Debugging a MySQL client

@cindex debugging, client
@cindex clients, debugging

To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with @code{--with-debug} or
@code{--with-debug=full}.
@xref{configure options,  , @code{configure} options}.

@tindex MYSQL_DEBUG environment variable
@tindex Environment variable, MYSQL_DEBUG
Before running a client, you should set the @code{MYSQL_DEBUG} environment
variable:

@example
shell> MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
shell> export MYSQL_DEBUG
@end example

This causes clients to generate a trace file in @file{/tmp/client.trace}.

If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running @code{mysql} in debugging mode (assuming that you
have compiled MySQL with debugging on):

@example
shell> mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
@end example

This will provide useful information in case you mail a bug report.
@xref{Bug reports}.

If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your @file{mysql.h} include file matches your MySQL library file.
A very common mistake is to use an old @file{mysql.h} file from an old
MySQL installation with new MySQL library.


@node The DBUG package, Locking methods, Debugging client, Porting
@appendixsec The DBUG Package

@cindex DBUG package

The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled
with the DBUG package originally made by Fred Fish.  When you have configured
MySQL for debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace
file of what the program is debugging. @xref{Making trace files}.

One uses the debug package by invoking the program with the
@code{--debug="..."} or the @code{-#...} option.

Most MySQL programs has a default debug string that will be
used if you don't specify an option to @code{--debug}.  The default
trace file is usually @code{/tmp/programname.trace} on Unix and
@code{\programname.trace} on Windows.

The debug control string is a sequence of colon-separated fields
as follows:

@example
<field_1>:<field_2>:...:<field_N>
@end example

Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by
an optional "," and comma-separated list of modifiers:

@example
flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]
@end example

The currently recognized flag characters are:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .95
@item @strong{Flag} @tab @strong{Description}
@item d @tab Enable output from DBUG_<N> macros for the current state. May be followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies output for all macros.
@item D @tab Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine capabilities. That is, @code{-#D,20} is delay two seconds.
@item f @tab Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of named functions.  Note that a null list will disable all functions.   The appropriate "d" or "t" flags must still be given, this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.
@item F @tab Identify the source file name for each line of debug or trace output.
@item i @tab Identify the process with the PID or thread ID for each line of debug or trace output.
@item g @tab Enable profiling.  Create a file called 'dbugmon.out' containing information that can be used to profile the program.  May be followed by a list of keywords that select profiling only for the functions in that list.  A null list implies that all functions are considered.
@item L @tab Identify the source file line number for each line of debug or trace output.
@item n @tab Print the current function nesting depth for each line of debug or trace output.
@item N @tab Number each line of dbug output.
@item o @tab Redirect the debugger output stream to the specified file.  The default output is stderr.
@item O @tab As @code{o} but the file is really flushed between each write. When needed the file is closed and reopened between each write.
@item p @tab Limit debugger actions to specified processes. A process must be identified with the DBUG_PROCESS macro and match one in the list for debugger actions to occur.
@item P @tab Print the current process name for each line of debug or trace output.
@item r @tab When pushing a new state, do not inherit the previous state's function nesting level. Useful when the output is to start at the left margin.
@item S @tab Do function _sanity(_file_,_line_) at each debugged function until _sanity() returns something that differs from 0. (Mostly used with safemalloc to find memory leaks)
@item t @tab Enable function call/exit trace lines. May be followed by a list (containing only one modifier) giving a numeric maximum trace level, beyond which no output will occur for either debugging or tracing macros.  The default is a compile time option.
@end multitable

Some examples of debug control strings which might appear on a shell
command line (the "-#" is typically used to introduce a control string
to an application program) are:

@example
-#d:t
-#d:f,main,subr1:F:L:t,20
-#d,input,output,files:n
-#d:t:i:O,\\mysqld.trace
@end example

In MySQL, common tags to print (with the @code{d} option) are:
@code{enter},@code{exit},@code{error},@code{warning},@code{info} and
@code{loop}.


@node Locking methods, RTS-threads, The DBUG package, Porting
@appendixsec Locking methods

@cindex locking methods
@cindex methods, locking

Currently MySQL only supports table locking for
@code{ISAM}/@code{MyISAM} and @code{HEAP} tables,
page-level locking for @code{BDB} tables and
row-level locking for @code{InnoDB} tables.
@xref{Internal locking}.
With @code{MyISAM} tables one can freely mix @code{INSERT} and
@code{SELECT} without locks, if the @code{INSERT} statements are non-conflicting
(that is, whenever they append to the end of the table file rather than
filling freespace from deleted rows/data).

Starting in version 3.23.33, you can analyse the table lock contention
on your system by checking @code{Table_locks_waited} and
@code{Table_locks_immediate} environment variables.

To decide if you want to use a table type with row-level locking,
you will want to look at what the application does and what the
select/update pattern of the data is.

Pros for row locking:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fewer lock conflicts when accessing different rows in many threads.
@item
Fewer changes for rollbacks.
@item
Makes it possible to lock a single row a long time.
@end itemize

Cons:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Takes more memory than page level or table locks.
@item
Is slower than page level or table locks when used on a big part of the table,
because you have to do many more locks.
@item
Is definitely much worse than other locks if you often do @code{GROUP
BY} on a large part of the data or if you often have to scan the whole table.
@item
With higher level locks one can also more easily support locks of
different types to tune the application as the lock overhead is less
notable as for row level locks.
@end itemize

Table locks are superior to page level / row level locks in the
following cases:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Mostly reads
@item
Read and updates on strict keys; this is where one updates or deletes
a row that can be fetched with one key read:
@example
UPDATE tbl_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key#
DELETE FROM tbl_name WHERE unique_key=#
@end example
@item
@code{SELECT} combined with @code{INSERT} (and very few @code{UPDATE}
and @code{DELETE} statements).
@item
Many scans / @code{GROUP BY} on the whole table without any writers.
@end itemize

Other options than row / page level locking:

Versioning (like we use in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where
you can have one writer at the same time as many readers.  This means
that the database/table supports different views for the data depending
on when one started to access it. Other names for this are time travel,
copy on write or copy on demand.

Copy on demand is in many case much better than page or row level
locking; the worst case does, however, use much more memory than
when using normal locks.

Instead of using row level locks one can use application level locks
(like get_lock/release_lock in MySQL).  This works
only in well-behaved applications.

In many cases one can do an educated guess which locking type is best
for the application, but generally it's very hard to say that a given
lock type is better than another; everything depends on the application
and different part of the application may require different lock types.

Here are some tips about locking in MySQL:

Most Web applications do lots of selects, very few
deletes, updates mainly on keys, and inserts in some specific tables.
The base MySQL setup is very well tuned for this.

Concurrent users are not a problem if you don't mix updates with selects
that need to examine many rows in the same table.

If you mix inserts and deletes on the same table, then @code{INSERT DELAYED}
may be of great help.

You can also use @code{LOCK TABLES} to speed up things (many updates within
a single lock is much faster than updates without locks).  Splitting
thing to different tables will also help.

If you encounter speed problems with the table locks in MySQL, you
may be able to solve these by converting some of your tables to @code{InnoDB}
or @code{BDB} tables.
@xref{InnoDB}. @xref{BDB}.

The optimization section in the manual covers many different aspects of
how to tune applications. @xref{Tips}.


@node RTS-threads, Thread packages, Locking methods, Porting
@appendixsec Comments about RTS threads

@cindex RTS-threads
@cindex threads, RTS

I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but
stumbled on the following problems:

They use an old version of a lot of POSIX calls and it is very tedious to
make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

Some wrappers are already written. See @file{mysys/my_pthread.c} for more info.

At least the following should be changed:

@code{pthread_get_specific} should use one argument.
@code{sigwait} should take two arguments.
A lot of functions (at least @code{pthread_cond_wait},
@code{pthread_cond_timedwait()})
should return the error code on error. Now they return -1 and set @code{errno}.

Another problem is that user-level threads use the @code{ALRM} signal and this
aborts a lot of functions (@code{read}, @code{write}, @code{open}...).
MySQL should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is
not that easy to verify it.

The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

To get thread-level alarms I changed @file{mysys/thr_alarm.c} to wait between
alarms with @code{pthread_cond_timedwait()}, but this aborts with error
@code{EINTR}.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the
following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
This shouldn't take that long.
@item
Compile all libraries with the @code{-DHAVE_rts_threads}.
@item
Compile @code{thr_alarm}.
@item
If there are some small differences in the implementation, they may be fixed
by changing @file{my_pthread.h} and @file{my_pthread.c}.
@item
Run @code{thr_alarm}. If it runs without any ``warning,'' ``error,'' or aborted
messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful run on
Solaris:
@example
Main thread: 1
Thread 0 (5) started
Thread: 5  Waiting

@node Thread packages,  , RTS-threads, Porting
@appendixsec Differences between different thread packages

@cindex thread packages, differences between

MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when
choosing a good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very
important.

There are at least three types of thread packages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe functions
with locks. Read, write and select operations are usually managed with a
thread-specific select that switches to another thread if the running
threads have to wait for data.  If the user thread packages are
integrated in the standard libs (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread
package requires less overhead than thread packages that have to map all
unsafe calls (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread-safe so the
mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).  Downside: All
mapped calls take a little time and it's quite tricky to be able to
handle all situations. There are usually also some system calls that are
not handled by the thread package (like MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread
scheduling isn't always optimal.
@item
User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between threads.
LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of processes. Thread
creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest are usually left hanging
and you must kill them all before restarting. Thread switching is
somewhat expensive.
@item
Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library or the
kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process, but on some
systems, @code{ps} may show the different threads. If one thread aborts, the
whole process aborts. Most system calls are thread-safe and should
require very little overhead.  Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and OSF/1 have kernel
threads.
@end itemize

In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user
level threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread
switching can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't
really ``thread aware.''

@appendix MySQL Regular Expressions

@cindex regex
@cindex regular expression syntax, described
@cindex syntax, regular expression

A regular expression is a powerful way of specifying a pattern for a complex
search.

MySQL uses Henry Spencer's implementation of regular expressions, which is
aimed at conformance with POSIX 1003.2.
@xref{Credits}.
MySQL uses the extended version to support pattern-matching operations
performed with the @code{REGEXP} operator in SQL statements.
@xref{Pattern matching}.

This appendix is a summary, with examples, of the special characters and
constructs that can be used in MySQL for @code{REGEXP} operations.
It does not contain all the details that can be found in
Henry Spencer's @code{regex(7)} manual page. That manual page is
included in MySQL source distributions, in the @file{regex.7} file under the
@file{regex} directory.

A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest regular
expression is one that has no special characters in it. For example, the
regular expression @code{hello} matches @code{hello} and nothing else.

Non-trivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that
they can match more than one string. For example, the regular expression
@code{hello|word} matches either the string @code{hello} or the string
@code{word}.

As a more complex example, the regular expression @code{B[an]*s} matches any
of the strings @code{Bananas}, @code{Baaaaas}, @code{Bs}, and any other
string starting with a @code{B}, ending with an @code{s}, and containing any
number of @code{a} or @code{n} characters in between.

A regular expression for the @code{REGEXP} operator may use any of the
following special characters and constructs:

@table @code
@item ^
Match the beginning of a string.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'fo\nfo' REGEXP '^fo$';                   -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'fofo' REGEXP '^fo';                      -> 1
@end example
@item $
Match the end of a string.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'fo\no' REGEXP '^fo\no$';                 -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'fo\no' REGEXP '^fo$';                    -> 0
@end example
@item .
Match any character (including carriage return and newline).
@example
mysql> SELECT 'fofo' REGEXP '^f.*$';                    -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'fo\r\nfo' REGEXP '^f.*$';                -> 1
@end example
@item a*
Match any sequence of zero or more @code{a} characters.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'Ban' REGEXP '^Ba*n';                     -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'Baaan' REGEXP '^Ba*n';                   -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'Bn' REGEXP '^Ba*n';                      -> 1
@end example
@item a+
Match any sequence of one or more @code{a} characters.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'Ban' REGEXP '^Ba+n';                     -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'Bn' REGEXP '^Ba+n';                      -> 0
@end example
@item a?
Match either zero or one @code{a} character.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'Bn' REGEXP '^Ba?n';                      -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'Ban' REGEXP '^Ba?n';                     -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'Baan' REGEXP '^Ba?n';                    -> 0
@end example
@item de|abc
Match either of the sequences @code{de} or @code{abc}.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'pi' REGEXP 'pi|apa';                     -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'axe' REGEXP 'pi|apa';                    -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'apa' REGEXP 'pi|apa';                    -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'apa' REGEXP '^(pi|apa)$';                -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'pi' REGEXP '^(pi|apa)$';                 -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'pix' REGEXP '^(pi|apa)$';                -> 0
@end example
@item (abc)*
Match zero or more instances of the sequence @code{abc}.
@example
mysql> SELECT 'pi' REGEXP '^(pi)*$';                    -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'pip' REGEXP '^(pi)*$';                   -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'pipi' REGEXP '^(pi)*$';                  -> 1
@end example
@item @{1@}
@itemx @{2,3@}
@code{@{n@}} or @code{@{m,n@}} notation provides
a more general way of writing regular expressions that match many
occurrences of the previous atom (or ``piece'') of the pattern.
@code{m} and @code{n} are integers.

@table @code
@item a*
Can be written as @code{a@{0,@}}.
@item a+
Can be written as @code{a@{1,@}}.
@item a?
Can be written as @code{a@{0,1@}}.
@end table

To be more precise, @code{a@{n@}} matches exactly @code{n} instances of
@code{a}.
@code{a@{n,@}} matches @code{n} or more instances of @code{a}.
@code{a@{m,n@}} matches @code{m} through @code{n} instances of @code{a},
inclusive.

@code{m} and @code{n} must be in the range from @code{0} to
@code{RE_DUP_MAX} (default 255), inclusive.  If both @code{m} and @code{n}
are given, @code{m} must be less than or equal to @code{n}.

@example
mysql> SELECT 'abcde' REGEXP 'a[bcd]@{2@}e';              -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'abcde' REGEXP 'a[bcd]@{3@}e';              -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'abcde' REGEXP 'a[bcd]@{1,10@}e';           -> 1
@end example

@item [a-dX]
@itemx [^a-dX]
Matches any character that is (or is not, if ^ is used) either @code{a},
@code{b}, @code{c}, @code{d} or @code{X}.  A @code{-} character between two other
characters forms a range that matches all characters from the first
character to the second. For example, @code{[0-9]} matches any decimal
digit.  To include a literal @code{]} character, it must immediately follow
the opening bracket @code{[}.  To include a literal @code{-} character, it
must be written first or last.  Any character that does not have a defined
meaning inside a @code{[]} pair has no special meaning and matches only
itself.

@example
mysql> SELECT 'aXbc' REGEXP '[a-dXYZ]';                 -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'aXbc' REGEXP '^[a-dXYZ]$';               -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'aXbc' REGEXP '^[a-dXYZ]+$';              -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'aXbc' REGEXP '^[^a-dXYZ]+$';             -> 0
mysql> SELECT 'gheis' REGEXP '^[^a-dXYZ]+$';            -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'gheisa' REGEXP '^[^a-dXYZ]+$';           -> 0
@end example

@item [.characters.]
Within a bracket expression (written using @code{[} and @code{]}),
matches the sequence of characters of that collating element. @code{characters}
is either a single character or a character name like @code{newline}.
You can find the full list of character names in @file{regexp/cname.h}.

@example

@item [=character_class=]
Within a bracket expression (written using @code{[} and @code{]}),
@code{[=character_class=]} represents
an equivalence class. It matches all characters with the same collation
value, including itself.
For example, if @code{o} and @code{(+)} are the members of an
equivalence class, then @code{[[=o=]]}, @code{[[=(+)=]]}, and
@code{[o(+)]} are all synonymous.
An equivalence class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

@item [:character_class:]
Within a bracket expression (written using @code{[} and @code{]}),
@code{[:character_class:]} represents a character class that matches all
characters belonging to that class. The standard class names are:

@multitable @columnfractions .10 .90
@item @code{alnum}  @tab Alphanumeric characters
@item @code{alpha}  @tab Alphabetic characters
@item @code{blank}  @tab Whitespace characters
@item @code{cntrl}  @tab Control characters
@item @code{digit}  @tab Digit characters
@item @code{graph}  @tab Graphic characters
@item @code{lower}  @tab Lowercase alphabetic characters
@item @code{print}  @tab Graphic or space characters
@item @code{punct}  @tab Punctuation characters
@item @code{space}  @tab Space, tab, newline, and carriage return
@item @code{upper}  @tab Uppercase alphabetic characters
@item @code{xdigit} @tab Hexadecimal digit characters
@end multitable

These stand for the character classes defined in the @code{ctype(3)} manual
page. A particular locale may provide other class names.
A character class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

@example
mysql> SELECT 'justalnums' REGEXP '[[:alnum:]]+';       -> 1
mysql> SELECT '!!' REGEXP '[[:alnum:]]+';               -> 0
@end example

@item [[:<:]]
@itemx [[:>:]]
These markers stand for word boundaries. They match the beginning and end of
words, respectively.  A word is a sequence of word characters that is not
preceded by or followed by word characters. A word character is an
alphanumeric character in the @code{alnum} class or an underscore
(@code{_}).

@example
mysql> SELECT 'a word a' REGEXP '[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]';   -> 1
mysql> SELECT 'a xword a' REGEXP '[[:<:]]word[[:>:]]';  -> 0
@end example

@end table

To use a literal instance of a special character in a regular expression,
precede it by two backslash (\) characters. The MySQL parser
interprets one of the backslashes, and the regular expression library
interprets the other. For example, to match the string @code{1+2} that
contains the special @code{+} character, only the last of the following
regular expressions is the correct one:

@example
mysql> SELECT '1+2' REGEXP '1+2';                       -> 0
mysql> SELECT '1+2' REGEXP '1\+2';                      -> 0
mysql> SELECT '1+2' REGEXP '1\\+2';                     -> 1

@heading Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

@iftex
@heading NO WARRANTY

@item
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

@item
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY

PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

@heading How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) @var{yyyy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
