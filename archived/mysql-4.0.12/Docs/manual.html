<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>constant</CODE>
<DD>
Constant-width font is used for command names and options; SQL statements;
database, table, and column names; C and Perl code; and environment variables.
Example: ``To see how <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> works, invoke it with the
<CODE>--help</CODE> option.''

<DT><TT>`filename'</TT>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is used for filenames and
pathnames.  Example: ``The distribution is installed under the
<TT>`/usr/local/'</TT> directory.''

<DT><SAMP>`c'</SAMP>
<DD>
Constant-width font with surrounding quotes is also used to indicate
character sequences.  Example: ``To specify a wildcard, use the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
character.''

<DT><EM>italic</EM>
<DD>
Italic font is used for emphasis, <EM>like this</EM>.

<DT><STRONG>boldface</STRONG>
<DD>
Boldface font is used in table headings and to convey
<STRONG>especially strong emphasis</STRONG>.
</DL>

<P>
When commands are shown that are meant to be executed by a particular
program, the program is indicated by a prompt shown before the command.  For
example, <CODE>shell&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from your login
shell, and <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> indicates a command that you execute from the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client program:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; type a shell command here
mysql&#62; type a mysql command here
</PRE>

<P>
Shell commands are shown using Bourne shell syntax.  If you are using a
<CODE>csh</CODE>-style shell, you may need to issue commands slightly differently.
For example, the sequence to set an environment variable and run a command
looks like this in Bourne shell syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; VARNAME=value some_command
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>csh</CODE>, you would execute the sequence like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; setenv VARNAME value
shell&#62; some_command
</PRE>

<P>
Often database, table, and column names must be substituted into commands.  To
indicate that such substitution is necessary, this manual uses
<CODE>db_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> and <CODE>col_name</CODE>.  For example, you might
see a statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM db_name.tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
This means that if you were to enter a similar statement, you would supply
your own database, table, and column names, perhaps like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT author_name FROM biblio_db.author_list;
</PRE>

<P>
SQL keywords are not case-sensitive and may be written in uppercase or
lowercase.  This manual uses uppercase.

</P>
<P>
In syntax descriptions, square brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>) are used
to indicate optional words or clauses.  For example, in the following
statement, <CODE>IF EXISTS</CODE> is optional:

</P>

<PRE>
DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
When a syntax element consists of a number of alternatives, the alternatives
are separated by vertical bars (<SAMP>`|'</SAMP>).  When one member from a set of
choices <STRONG>may</STRONG> be chosen, the alternatives are listed within square
brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
TRIM([[BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [remstr] FROM] str)
</PRE>

<P>
When one member from a set of choices <STRONG>must</STRONG> be chosen, the
alternatives are listed within braces (<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
{DESCRIBE | DESC} tbl_name {col_name | wild}

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MySQL</CODE> is a database management system.
<DD>
A database is a structured collection of data.  It may be anything from a
simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of
information in a corporate network.  To add, access, and process data
stored in a computer database, you need a database management system
such as <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Server.  Since computers are very good at handling large
amounts of data, database management plays a central role in computing,
as stand-alone utilities, or as parts of other applications.

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>

<DT>MySQL is a relational database management system.
<DD>
A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting
all the data in one big storeroom.  This adds speed and flexibility.
The tables are linked by defined relations making it possible to combine
data from several tables on request. The <CODE>SQL</CODE> part of
``<CODE>MySQL</CODE>'' stands for ``<CODE>Structured Query Language</CODE>''@-the
most common standardised language used to access databases.

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<DT>MySQL software is <CODE>Open Source</CODE>.
<DD>
<CODE>Open Source</CODE> means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify.
Anybody can download the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software from the Internet and use it
without paying anything.  Anybody so inclined can study the source code
and change it to fit their needs.  The <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software uses the
<CODE>GPL</CODE> (<CODE>GNU General Public License</CODE>),
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>, to define what you
may and may not do with the software in different situations.
If you feel uncomfortable with the <CODE>GPL</CODE> or need to embed
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> code into a commercial application you can buy a
commercially licensed version from us.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_licenses">1.4.3  MySQL Licenses</A>.

<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>

<DT>Why use the MySQL Database Server?
<DD>
The <CODE>MySQL Database Server</CODE> is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.
If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try.
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> also has a practical set of features developed in
close cooperation with our users.  You can find a performance comparison
of <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> to some other database managers on our benchmark page.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> was originally developed to handle large databases
much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in
highly demanding production environments for several years.  Though
under constant development, <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> today offers a rich and
useful set of functions.  Its connectivity, speed, and security make
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.

<DT>The technical features of MySQL Server
<DD>
For advanced technical information, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Reference">6  MySQL Language Reference</A>.
The <CODE>MySQL Database Software</CODE> is a client/server system that consists
of a multi-threaded <CODE>SQL</CODE> server that supports different backends,
several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools,
and a wide range of programming interfaces (<CODE>API</CODE>s).

We also provide <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> as a multi-threaded library which you
can link into your application to get a smaller, faster, easier-to-manage
product.

<DT>There is a large amount of contributed MySQL software available.
<DD>
It is very likely that you will find that your favorite application or
language already supports the <CODE>MySQL Database Server</CODE>.

The official way to pronounce <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is ``My Ess Que Ell'' (not
``my sequel''), but we don't mind if you pronounce it as ``my sequel''
or in some other localised way.

</P>
<P>
We once started out with the intention of using <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to connect to our
tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some
testing we came to the conclusion that <CODE>mSQL</CODE> was not fast enough nor
flexible enough for our needs.  This resulted in a new SQL interface to our
database but with almost the same API interface as <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.  This API was
chosen to ease porting of third-party code.

</P>
<P>
The derivation of the name <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is not perfectly clear.  Our base
directory and a large number of our libraries and tools have had the prefix
``my'' for well over 10 years.  However, Monty's daughter (some years younger)
is also named My.  Which of the two gave its name to <CODE>MySQL</CODE> is
still a mystery, even for us.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Internals and Portability
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Written in C and C++.  Tested with a broad range of different compilers.
<LI>

Works on many different platforms.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Uses GNU Automake, Autoconf, and Libtool for portability.
<LI>

APIs for C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Tcl.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Clients">8  MySQL APIs</A>.
<LI>

Fully multi-threaded using kernel threads.  This means it can easily
use multiple CPUs if available.
<LI>

Very fast B-tree disk tables with index compression.
<LI>

A very fast thread-based memory allocation system.
<LI>

Very fast joins using an optimised one-sweep multi-join.
<LI>

In-memory hash tables which are used as temporary tables.
<LI>

SQL functions are implemented through a highly optimised class library and
should be as fast as possible!  Usually there isn't any memory allocation
at all after query initialisation.
<LI>

The <CODE>MySQL</CODE> code gets tested with Purify
(a commercial memory leakage detector) as well as with Valgrind,
a GPL tool (<a HREF="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/</a>).
</UL>

<DT>Column Types
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Many column types: signed/unsigned integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 bytes
long, <CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>,
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>YEAR</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, and <CODE>ENUM</CODE> types.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>.
<LI>

Fixed-length and variable-length records.
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
All columns have default values.
You can use <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to insert a subset of a table's columns; those
columns that are not explicitly given values are set to their default
values.
</UL>

<DT>Commands and Functions
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Full operator and function support in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
parts of queries.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
    -&#62; FROM tbl_name
    -&#62; WHERE income/dependents &#62; 10000 AND age &#62; 30;
</PRE>

<LI>

Full support for SQL <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses with
expressions.  Support for group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>,
<CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>, <CODE>AVG()</CODE>, <CODE>STD()</CODE>, <CODE>SUM()</CODE>,
<CODE>MAX()</CODE>, and <CODE>MIN()</CODE>).
<LI>

Support for <CODE>LEFT OUTER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</CODE> with ANSI
SQL and ODBC syntax.
<LI>

Aliases on tables and columns are allowed as in the SQL92 standard.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> return
the number of rows that were changed (affected).  It is possible to return
the number of rows matched instead by setting a flag when connecting to the
server.
<LI>

The <CODE>MySQL</CODE>-specific <CODE>SHOW</CODE> command can be used to retrieve
information about databases, tables, and indexes.  The <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
can be used to determine how the optimiser resolves a query.
<LI>

Function names do not clash with table or column names.  For example,
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is a valid column name.  The only restriction is that for a
function call, no spaces are allowed between the function name and the
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> that follows it.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reserved_words">6.1.7  Is MySQL Picky About Reserved Words?</A>.
<LI>

You can mix tables from different databases in the same query (as of
Version 3.22).
</UL>

<DT>Security
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

A privilege and password system that is very flexible and secure, and
allows host-based verification.  Passwords are secure because all
password traffic is encrypted when you connect to a server.
</UL>

<DT>Scalability and Limits
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Handles large databases.  We are using <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> with some
databases that contain 50 million records and we know of users that
use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> with 60,000 tables and about 5,000,000,000 rows.
<LI>

Up to 32 indexes per table are allowed.  Each index may consist of 1 to 16
columns or parts of columns.  The maximum index width is 500 bytes
(this may be changed when compiling <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>).
An index may use a prefix of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> field.
</UL>

<DT>Connectivity
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Clients may connect to the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server using TCP/IP Sockets,
Unix Sockets (Unix), or Named Pipes (NT).
<LI>

<CODE>ODBC</CODE> (Open-DataBase-Connectivity) support for Win32 (with source).
All ODBC 2.5 functions and many others.  For example, you can use
MS Access to connect to your <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC">8.3  MySQL ODBC Support</A>.
</UL>

<DT>Localisation
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

The server can provide error messages to clients in many languages.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.
<LI>

Full support for several different character sets, including
ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), german, big5, ujis, and more.  For example,
the Scandinavian characters 'å', 'ä' and 'ö' are allowed in table
and column names.
<LI>

All data is saved in the chosen character set.  All comparisons for normal
string columns are case-insensitive.
<LI>

Sorting is done according to the chosen character set (the Swedish
way by default).  It is possible to change this when the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
server is started.  To see an example of very advanced sorting, look
at the Czech sorting code.  <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> supports many different
character sets that can be specified at compile and runtime.
</UL>

<DT>Clients and Tools
<DD>

<UL>
<LI>

Includes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, a very fast utility for table checking,
optimisation, and repair.  All of the functionality of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is also available through the SQL interface as well.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.
<LI>

All <CODE>MySQL</CODE> programs can be invoked with the <CODE>--help</CODE> or <CODE>-?</CODE>
options to obtain online assistance.

<H3><A NAME="Stability" HREF="manual_toc.html#Stability">1.2.3  How Stable Is MySQL?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>

</P>
<P>
This section addresses the questions ``<EM>How stable is MySQL Server?</EM>''
and ``<EM>Can I depend on MySQL Server in this project?</EM>''
We will try to clarify these issues and answer some important
questions that concern many potential users. The information in this
section is based on data gathered from the mailing list, which is
very active in identifying problems as well as reporting types of use.

</P>
<P>
Original code stems back from the early '80s, providing a stable code
base, and the ISAM table format remains backward-compatible.
At TcX, the predecessor of <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>, <CODE>MySQL</CODE> code has worked
in projects since mid-1996, without any problems.
When the <CODE>MySQL Database Software</CODE> was released to a wider public,
we noticed that there were
some pieces of ``untested code'' that were quickly found by the new
users who made different types of queries from us. Each new release
has had fewer portability problems (even though each new release has
had many new features).

</P>
<P>
Each release of the <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> has been usable. There have only
been problems
when users try code from the ``gray zones.''  Naturally, new users
don't know what the gray zones are; this section attempts to indicate
those that are currently known.
The descriptions mostly deal with Version 3.23 of <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>.
All known and reported bugs are fixed in the latest version, with the
exception of those listed in the bugs section, which are things that
are design-related.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.5  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> design is multi-layered with independent modules.
Some of the newer modules are listed here with an indication of how
well-tested each of them is:

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> is being used in large, heavy-load production systems.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>BDB</CODE> tables -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
The <CODE>Berkeley DB</CODE> code is very stable, but we are still improving
the <CODE>BDB</CODE> transactional storage engine interface in
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, so it will take some time before this is as well
tested as the other table types.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> -- Beta</STRONG>
<DD>
Full-text search works but is not yet widely used.
Important enhancements are being implemented for <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>MyODBC 2.50</CODE> (uses ODBC SDK 2.5) -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
Increasingly in wide use. Some issues brought up appear to be
application-related and independent of the ODBC driver or underlying
database server.

<DT><STRONG>Automatic recovery of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
This status only regards the new code in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage
engine that checks if the table was closed properly on open and
executes an automatic check/repair of the table if it wasn't.

<DT><STRONG>Bulk-insert -- Alpha</STRONG>
<DD>
New feature in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0 for faster
insert of many rows.

<DT><STRONG>Locking -- Gamma</STRONG>
<DD>
This is very system-dependent.  On some systems there are big problems
using standard OS locking (<CODE>fcntl()</CODE>).  In these cases, you should
run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> flag.
Problems are known to occur on some Linux systems, and on SunOS when
using NFS-mounted filesystems.

<CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> provides high-quality support for paying customers,

questions. Bugs are usually fixed right away with a patch; for serious
bugs, there is almost always a new release.

<H3><A NAME="Table_size" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_size">1.2.4  How Big Can MySQL Tables Be?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>

<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.22 has a 4G limit on table size. With the new
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.23, the maximum table
size is pushed up to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes).

</P>
<P>
Note, however, that operating systems have their own file-size
limits. Here are some examples:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Operating System</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>File-Size Limit</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Intel 32 bit </TD><TD> 2G, 4G or more, depends on Linux version
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Linux-Alpha </TD><TD> 8T (?)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.5.1 </TD><TD> 2G (possible 4G with patch)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.6 </TD><TD> 4G (can be changed with flag)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.7 Intel </TD><TD> 4G
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Solaris 2.7 UltraSPARC </TD><TD> 512G
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
On Linux 2.2 you can get bigger tables than 2G by using the LFS patch for
the ext2 filesystem.  On Linux 2.4 patches also exist for ReiserFS
to get support for big files.

</P>
<P>
This means that the table size for <CODE>MySQL</CODE> databases is normally
limited by the operating system.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>MySQL</CODE> tables have a maximum size of about 4G.  You can
check the maximum table size for a table with the <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE>
command or with the <CODE>myisamchk -dv table_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.6  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you need bigger tables than 4G (and your operating system supports
this), you should set the <CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> and <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE>
parameter when you create your table.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
also set these later with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your big table is going to be read-only, you could use
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to merge and compress many tables to one.
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> usually compresses a table by at least 50%, so you can
have, in effect, much bigger tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can go around the operating system file limit for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> data
files by using the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another solution can be the included <CODE>MERGE</CODE> library, which allows
you to handle a collection of identical tables as one.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Year_2000_compliance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.2.5  Year 2000 Compliance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> itself has no problems with Year 2000 (Y2K)
compliance:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> uses Unix time functions and has no problems with dates
until <CODE>2069</CODE>; all 2-digit years are regarded to be in the range
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE>, which means that if you store <CODE>01</CODE> in a
<CODE>year</CODE> column, <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE> treats it as <CODE>2001</CODE>.

<LI>

All <CODE>MySQL</CODE> date functions are stored in one file, <TT>`sql/time.cc'</TT>,
and are coded very carefully to be year 2000-safe.

<LI>

In <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Version 3.22 and later, the new <CODE>YEAR</CODE> column type
can store years <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE> in 1 byte and
display them using 2 or 4 digits.
</UL>

<P>
You may run into problems with applications that use <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>
in a way that is not Y2K-safe.  For example, many old applications store
or manipulate years using 2-digit values (which are ambiguous) rather than
4-digit values.  This problem may be compounded by applications that use
values such as <CODE>00</CODE> or <CODE>99</CODE> as ``missing'' value indicators.

</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, these problems may be difficult to fix because different
applications may be written by different programmers, each of whom may
use a different set of conventions and date-handling functions.

</P>
<P>
Here is a simple demonstration illustrating that <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>
doesn't have any problems with dates until the year 2030:

</P>

Technical support from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> means individualised answers
to your unique problems direct from the software engineers who code
the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database engine.

</P>
<P>
We try to take a broad and inclusive view of technical support. Almost
any problem involving <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software is important to us if it's
important to you.
Typically customers seek help on how to get different commands and
utilities to work, remove performance bottlenecks, restore crashed
systems, understand operating system or networking impacts on <CODE>MySQL</CODE>,
set up best practices for backup and recovery, utilise <CODE>API</CODE>s, etc.
Our support covers only the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server and our own utilities,
not third-party products that access the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server, though we
try to help with these where we can.

</P>
<P>
Detailed information about our various support options is given at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/support/">http://www.mysql.com/support/</a>, where support contracts can also be
ordered online. If you have restricted access to the Internet, contact
our sales staff at <a HREF="mailto:sales@mysql.com">sales@mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
Technical support is like life insurance. You can live happily
without it for years, but when your hour arrives it becomes
critically important, yet it's too late to buy it!
If you use <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Server for important applications and encounter
sudden troubles,  it might take too long to figure out all the answers
yourself. You may need immediate access to the most experienced
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> troubleshooters available, those employed by <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>.

<P>
The <CODE>GPL</CODE> license is contagious in the sense that when a program
is linked to a <CODE>GPL</CODE> program all the source code for all the parts
of the resulting product must also be released under the <CODE>GPL</CODE>.
Otherwise you break the license terms and forfeit your right to use the
<CODE>GPL</CODE> program altogether and also risk damages.

</P>
<P>
You need a commercial license:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When you link a program with any <CODE>GPL</CODE> code from the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
software and don't want the resulting product to be <CODE>GPL</CODE>, maybe
because you want to build a commercial product or keep the added
non-<CODE>GPL</CODE> code closed source for other reasons. When purchasing
commercial licenses, you are not using the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software under
<CODE>GPL</CODE> even though it's the same code.

<LI>

When you distribute a non-<CODE>GPL</CODE> application that <STRONG>only</STRONG> works with the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software and ship it with the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software. This type
of solution is actually considered to be linking even if it's done over
a network.

<LI>

When you distribute copies of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software without providing
the source code as required under the <CODE>GPL</CODE> license.

<LI>

When you want to support the further development of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
database even if you don't formally need a commercial license.
Purchasing support directly from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> is another good way
of contributing to the development of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software, with
immediate advantages for you.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.
</UL>

<P>
If you require a license, you will need one for each installation of the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software. This covers any number of CPUs on a machine, and there
is no artificial limit on the number of clients that connect to the server
in any way.

see the generic FAQ from the Free Software Foundation at

Some common cases:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When you distribute both your own application as well as the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
source code under the <CODE>GPL</CODE> with your product.

<LI>

When you distribute the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> source code bundled with other
programs that are not linked to or dependent on the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> system
for their functionality even if you sell the distribution commercially.
This is called mere aggregation in the <CODE>GPL</CODE> license.

<LI>

If you are not distributing <STRONG>any</STRONG> part of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
system, you can use it for free.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
When you are an Internet Service Provider (ISP), offering web hosting
with <CODE>MySQL</CODE> servers for your customers.
However, we do encourage people to use ISPs that have MySQL support,
as this will give them the confidence that if they have some problem
with the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> installation, their ISP will in fact have the
resources to solve the problem for them.
Note that even if an ISP does not have a commercial license for
<CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, they should at least give their customers read
access to the source of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> installation so that the
customers can verify that it is patched correctly.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
When you use the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> Database Software in conjunction with a
web server, you do not need a commercial license (so long as it is not
a product you distribute). This is true even if you run a commercial
web server that uses <CODE>MySQL Server</CODE>, because you are not
distributing any part of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> system. However, in this
case we would like you to purchase <CODE>MySQL</CODE> support because the
<CODE>MySQL</CODE> software is helping your enterprise.
</UL>

<P>
If your use of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database software does not require a commercial
license, we encourage you to purchase support from <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> anyway.
This way you contribute toward <CODE>MySQL</CODE> development and also gain
immediate advantages for yourself. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database software in a commercial context
such that you profit by its use, we ask that you further the development
of the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> software by purchasing some level of support.  We feel
that if the <CODE>MySQL</CODE> database helps your business, it is reasonable to
ask that you help <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE>.
(Otherwise, if you ask us support questions, you are not only using
for free something into which we've put a lot a work, you're asking
us to provide free support, too.)

embed MySQL Server into various applications and electronics devices, where

the scenes in Internet appliances, public kiosks, turnkey
hardware/software combination units, high performance Internet

The <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> storage engine is now offered as a feature of the
standard MySQL server, including full support for <CODE>transactions</CODE>
and <CODE>row-level locking</CODE>.

<LI>

Our German, Austrian, and Swiss users will note that we have a new character
set, <CODE>latin1_de</CODE>, which corrects the <EM>German sorting order</EM>,
placing German umlauts in the same order as German telephone books.

<LI>

Features to simplify migration from other database systems to MySQL
Server include <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> (like in Oracle) and <CODE>IDENTITY</CODE> as a
synonym for automatically incremented keys (like in Sybase). Many users will
also be happy to learn that MySQL Server now supports the <CODE>UNION</CODE> statement,
a long-awaited standard SQL feature.

<LI>

In the process of building features for new users, we have not forgotten
requests by the community of loyal users.
We have multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.
By adding support for <CODE>symbolic linking</CODE> to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> on the table
level (and not just the database level as before), as well as by enabling symlink
handling by default on Windows, we hope to show that we take enhancement
requests seriously.
Functions like <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE> make it
possible to know how many rows a query would have returned without a
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause.

<H3><A NAME="Nutshell_Future_features" HREF="manual_toc.html#Nutshell_Future_features">1.5.5  Future MySQL 4.x Features</A></H3>

<P>
For the upcoming MySQL Server 4.x releases,
expect the following features now still under development:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mission-critical, heavy-load users of MySQL Server will appreciate
the additions to our replication system and our online hot backup.
Later versions of 4.x will include <CODE>fail-safe replication</CODE>;
already existing in 4.0, the <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> command
will soon automate slave setup. The <CODE>online backup</CODE> will make
it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down
the master, and have a very low performance penalty on
update-heavy systems.

<LI>

A convenience feature for Database Administrators is that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> parameters (startup options) can soon be set without
taking down the servers.

<LI>

The new <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> search properties of MySQL Server 4.0 enable the
use of <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexing of large text masses with both binary and
natural-language searching logic. Users can customise minimal word
length and define their own stop word lists in any human language,
enabling a new set of applications to be built on MySQL Server.

<LI>

Many read-heavy applications will benefit from
further increased speed through the rewritten <CODE>key cache</CODE>.

<LI>

Many developers will also be happy to see the <CODE>MySQL command help</CODE>
in the client.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Nutshell_4.1_development_release" HREF="manual_toc.html#Nutshell_4.1_development_release">1.5.6  MySQL 4.1, The Following Development Release</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL Server 4.0 lays the foundation for the new features of
MySQL Server 4.1 and onward, such as <CODE>nested subqueries</CODE> (4.1),
<CODE>stored procedures</CODE> (5.0), and
<CODE>foreign key integrity rules</CODE> for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (5.0),
which form the top of the wish list for many of our customers. 

</P>
<P>
After those additions, critics of the MySQL Database Server have
to be more imaginative
than ever in pointing out deficiencies in the MySQL Database
Management System. For long already known for its stability,
speed, and ease of use, MySQL Server will then match the requirement
checklist of very demanding buyers.

Before posting a bug report or question, please do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start by searching the MySQL online manual at:
<BR>
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/">http://www.mysql.com/doc/</a>
<BR>
We try to keep the manual up to date by updating it frequently with
solutions to newly found problems! The change history appendix
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/News.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/News.html</a>) can be particularly
useful since it is quite possible that a newer version already
contains a solution to your problem.

<LI>

Search in the bugs database at <a HREF="http://bugs.mysql.com">http://bugs.mysql.com</a> if the
bug has already been reported/solved.

<LI>

Search the MySQL mailing list archives:
<BR>
<a HREF="http://lists.mysql.com/">http://lists.mysql.com/</a>
<BR>
<LI>

You can also use <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/search/">http://www.mysql.com/search/</a> to search all the
web pages (including the manual) that are located at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>.
</UL>

<P>
If you can't find an answer in the manual or the archives, check with your
local MySQL expert.  If you still can't find an answer to your
question, go ahead and read the next section about how to send mail to
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.

Writing a good bug report takes patience, but doing it right the first
time saves time for us and for you.  A good bug report containing a full
test case for the bug will make it very likely that we will fix it in
the next release.  This section will help you write your report correctly
so that you don't waste your time doing things that may not help us much
or at all.

</P>
<P>
We encourage everyone to use the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script to generate a bug
report (or a report about any problem), if possible.  <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> can be
found in the <TT>`scripts'</TT> directory in the source distribution, or for a
binary distribution, in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under your MySQL
installation directory.  If you are unable to use <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>, you should
still include all the necessary information listed in this section.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script helps you generate a report by determining much
of the following information automatically, but if something important is
missing, please include it with your message!  Please read this section
carefully and make sure that all the information described here is included
in your report.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
The normal place to report bugs and problems is
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.  If you can make a test case that clearly
demonstrates the bug, you should post it to the <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>
list.  Note that on this list you should only post a full, repeatable bug
report using the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script.  If you are running on Windows,
you should include a description of the operating system and the
MySQL version.  Preferably, you should test the problem using
the latest stable or development version of MySQL Server before
posting!  Anyone should be able to repeat the bug by just using
``<CODE>mysql test &#60; script</CODE>'' on the included test case or run the
shell or Perl script that is included in the bug report.  All bugs
posted on the <CODE>bugs</CODE> list will be corrected or documented in the next
MySQL release!  If only small code changes are needed
to correct this problem, we will also post a patch that fixes the
problem.

</P>
<P>
If you have found a sensitive security bug in MySQL, you should send an
e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:security@mysql.com">security@mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
Remember that it is possible to respond to a message containing too much
information, but not to one containing too little.  Often people omit facts
because they think they know the cause of a problem and assume that some
details don't matter.  A good principle is: if you are in doubt about stating
something, state it!  It is a thousand times faster and less troublesome to
write a couple of lines more in your report than to be forced to ask again
and wait for the answer because you didn't include enough information the
first time.

</P>
<P>
The most common errors are that people don't indicate the version number of
the MySQL distribution they are using, or don't indicate what
platform they have the MySQL server installed on (including the platform
version number).  This is highly relevant information, and in 99 cases out of
100 the bug report is useless without it!  Very often we get questions like,
``Why doesn't this work for me?'' Then we find that the feature
requested wasn't implemented in that MySQL version, or that a bug
described in a report has been fixed already in newer MySQL
versions.  Sometimes the error is platform-dependent; in such cases, it is
next to impossible to fix anything without knowing the operating system and
the version number of the platform.

</P>
<P>
Remember also to provide information about your compiler, if it is related to
the problem.  Often people find bugs in compilers and think the problem is
MySQL-related.  Most compilers are under development all the time and
become better version by version.  To determine whether your
problem depends on your compiler, we need to know what compiler is used.
Note that every compiling problem should be regarded as a bug report and
reported accordingly.

</P>
<P>
It is most helpful when a good description of the problem is included in the
bug report.  That is, a good example of all the things you did that led to
the problem and the problem itself exactly described.  The best reports are
those that include a full example showing how to reproduce the bug or
problem.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case When You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a program produces an error message, it is very important to include the
message in your report!  If we try to search for something from the archives
using programs, it is better that the error message reported exactly matches
the one that the program produces.  (Even the case should be observed!)
You should never try to remember what the error message was; instead, copy
and paste the entire message into your report!

</P>
<P>
If you have a problem with MyODBC, you should try to generate a MyODBC
trace file.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyODBC_bug_report">8.3.7  Reporting Problems with MyODBC</A>.

</P>
<P>
Please remember that many of the people who will read your report will
do so using an 80-column display.  When generating reports or examples
using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool, you should therefore use
the <CODE>--vertical</CODE> option (or the <CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator)
for output that would exceed the available width for such a display
(for example, with the <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> statement; see the
example later in this section).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
Please include the following information in your report:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The version number of the MySQL distribution you are using (for
example, MySQL Version 3.22.22). You can find out which version you
are running by executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can be
found in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

The manufacturer and model of the machine you are working on.

<LI>

The operating system name and version.  For most operating systems, you can
get this information by executing the Unix command <CODE>uname -a</CODE>.

<LI>

Sometimes the amount of memory (real and virtual) is relevant. If in doubt,
include these values.

<LI>

If you are using a source distribution of the MySQL software, the name and
version number of the compiler used is needed.  If you have a binary
distribution, the distribution name is needed.

<LI>

If the problem occurs during compilation, include the exact error
message(s) and also a few lines of context around the offending code in the
file where the error occurred.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should also report the query that crashed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  You can usually find this out by running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
logging enabled.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_log_files">E.1.5  Using Log Files to Find Cause of Errors in mysqld</A>.

<LI>

If any database table is related to the problem, include the output from
<CODE>mysqldump --no-data db_name tbl_name1 tbl_name2 ...</CODE>.  This is very easy
to do and is a powerful way to get information about any table in a database
that will help us create a situation matching the one you have.

<LI>

For speed-related bugs or problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, you
should always include the output of <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE>, and at
least the number of rows that the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement produces.  You
should also include the output from <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name</CODE>
for each involved table. The more information you give about your
situation, the more likely it is that someone can help you!  For
example, the following is an example of a very good bug report (it
should of course be posted with the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script):

Example run using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool (note the use of the
<CODE>\G</CODE> statement terminator for statements whose output width would
otherwise exceed that of an 80-column display device):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW VARIABLES;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...\G
       &#60;output from SHOW COLUMNS&#62;
mysql&#62; EXPLAIN SELECT ...\G
       &#60;output from EXPLAIN&#62;
mysql&#62; FLUSH STATUS;
mysql&#62; SELECT ...;
       &#60;A short version of the output from SELECT,
       including the time taken to run the query&#62;
mysql&#62; SHOW STATUS;
       &#60;output from SHOW STATUS&#62;
</PRE>

<LI>

If a bug or problem occurs while running <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, try to provide an
input script that will reproduce the anomaly.  This script should include any
necessary source files.  The more closely the script can reproduce your
situation, the better.  If you can make a reproduceable test case, you should
post this to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> for a high-priority treatment!

If you can't provide a script, you should at least include the output
from <CODE>mysqladmin variables extended-status processlist</CODE> in your mail to
provide some information of how your system is performing!

<LI>

If you can't produce a test case in a few rows, or if the test table
is too big to be mailed to the mailing list (more than 10 rows), you should
dump your tables using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and create a <TT>`README'</TT> file
that describes your problem.

Create a compressed archive of your files using
<CODE>tar</CODE> and <CODE>gzip</CODE> or <CODE>zip</CODE>, and use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer the
archive to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  Then send a
short description of the problem to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>.

<LI>

If you think that the MySQL server produces a strange result from a query,
include not only the result, but also your opinion of what the result
should be, and an account describing the basis for your opinion.

<LI>

When giving an example of the problem, it's better to use the variable names,
table names, etc., that exist in your actual situation than to come up with
new names.  The problem could be related to the name of a variable or table!
These cases are rare, perhaps, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
After all, it should be easier for you to provide an example that uses your
actual situation, and it is by all means better for us.  In case you have data
you don't want to show to others, you can use <CODE>ftp</CODE> to transfer it to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  If the data is really top
secret and you don't want to show it even to us, then go ahead and provide
an example using other names, but please regard this as the last choice.

<LI>

Include all the options given to the relevant programs, if possible.  For
example, indicate the options that you use when you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
daemon and that you use to run any MySQL client programs.  The
options to programs like <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>mysql</CODE>, and to the
<CODE>configure</CODE> script, are often keys to answers and are very relevant!
It is never a bad idea to include them anyway!  If you use any modules, such
as Perl or PHP, please include the version number(s) of those as well.

<LI>

If your question is related to the privilege system, please include the
output of <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>, the output of <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>, and all
the error messages you get when trying to connect!  When you test your
privileges, you should first run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.  After this, execute
<CODE>mysqladmin reload version</CODE> and try to connect with the program that
gives you trouble.  <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`bin'</TT>
directory under your MySQL installation directory.

<LI>

If you have a patch for a bug, that is good. But don't assume the patch is
all we need, or that we will use it, if you don't provide some necessary
information such as test cases showing the bug that your patch fixes.  We
might find problems with your patch or we might not understand it at all; if
so, we can't use it.

If we can't verify exactly what the patch is meant for, we won't use it.
Test cases will help us here.  Show that the patch will handle all the
situations that may occur.  If we find a borderline case (even a rare one)
where the patch won't work, it may be useless.

<LI>

Guesses about what the bug is, why it occurs, or what it depends on
are usually wrong.  Even the MySQL team can't guess such things
without first using a debugger to determine the real cause of a bug.

<LI>

Indicate in your mail message that you have checked the reference manual
and mail archive so that others know you have tried to solve the
problem yourself.

<LI>

If you get a <CODE>parse error</CODE>, please check your syntax closely!  If
you can't find something wrong with it, it's extremely likely that your
current version of MySQL Server doesn't support the query you are
using.  If you are using the current version and the manual at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/">http://www.mysql.com/doc/</a> doesn't cover the
syntax you are using, MySQL Server doesn't support your query.  In this
case, your only options are to implement the syntax yourself or e-mail
<a HREF="mailto:licensing@mysql.com">licensing@mysql.com</a> and ask for an offer to implement it!

If the manual covers the syntax you are using, but you have an older version
of MySQL Server, you should check the MySQL change history to see
when the syntax was implemented.  In this case, you have the option of
upgrading to a newer version of MySQL Server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.

<LI>

If you have a problem such that your data appears corrupt or you get
errors when you access some particular table, you should first check and then
try repairing your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

If you often get corrupted tables you should try to find out when and why this
happens.  In this case, the <TT>`mysql-data-directory/'hostname'.err'</TT> file
may contain some information about what happened.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.  Please
include any relevant information from this file in your bug report.  Normally
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> should <STRONG>never</STRONG> crash a table if nothing killed it in the
middle of an update!  If you can find the cause of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dying,
it's much easier for us to provide you with a fix for the problem.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A>.

<LI>

If possible, download and install the most recent version of MySQL Server
and check whether it solves your problem.  All versions of
the MySQL software are thoroughly tested and should work without problems.
We believe in making everything as backward-compatible as possible,
and you  should be able to switch MySQL versions without any hassle.

This section describes how MySQL relates to the ANSI SQL standards.
MySQL Server has many extensions to the ANSI SQL standards, and here you
will find out what they are and how to use them.  You will also find
information about functionality missing from MySQL Server, and how to work
around some differences.

</P>
<P>
Our goal is to not, without a very good reason, restrict MySQL Server usability
for any usage.  Even if we don't have the resources to do development
for every possible use, we are always willing to help and offer
suggestions to people who are trying to use MySQL Server in new territories.

</P>
<P>
One of our main goals with the product is to continue to work toward
ANSI 99 compliancy, but without sacrificing speed or reliability.
We are not afraid to add extensions to SQL or support for non-SQL
features if this greatly increases the usability of MySQL Server for a big
part of our users.  (The new <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> interface in MySQL Server 4.0
is an example of this strategy. See section <A HREF="manual.html#HANDLER">6.4.2  <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> Syntax</A>.)

</P>
<P>
We will continue to support transactional and non-transactional
databases to satisfy both heavy web/logging usage and mission-critical
24/7 usage.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Server was designed from the start to work with medium size databases
(10-100 million rows, or about 100 MB per table) on small computer
systems.  We will continue to extend MySQL Server to work even better
with terabyte-size databases, as well as to make it possible
to compile a reduced MySQL version that is more suitable for hand-held
devices and embedded usage.  The compact design of the MySQL server makes both
of these directions possible without any conflicts in the source tree.

</P>
<P>
We are currently not targeting realtime support or clustered databases
(even if you can already do a lot of things with our replication
services).

</P>
<P>
We don't believe that one should have native XML support in the
database, but will instead add the XML support our users request from
us on the client side.  We think it's better to keep the main server
code as ``lean and clean'' as possible and instead develop libraries to
deal with the complexity on the client side.  This is part of the strategy
mentioned previously of not sacrificing speed or reliability in the
server.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Standards" HREF="manual_toc.html#Standards">1.7.1  What Standards Does MySQL Follow?</A></H3>

If you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--ansi</CODE> option, the following
behaviour of MySQL Server changes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>||</CODE> is string concatenation instead of <CODE>OR</CODE>.

<LI>

You can have any number of spaces between a function name and the <SAMP>`('</SAMP>.
This forces all function names to be treated as reserved words.

<LI>

<SAMP>`"'</SAMP> will be an identifier quote character (like the MySQL Server
<SAMP>``'</SAMP> quote character) and not a string quote character.

<LI>

<CODE>REAL</CODE> will be a synonym for <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> instead of a synonym for
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.

<LI>

The default transaction isolation level is <CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.3  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can use a field/expression in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> that is not in the
field list.
</UL>

<P>
This is the same as using
<CODE>--sql-mode=REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,
IGNORE_SPACE,SERIALIZE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</CODE>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Extensions_to_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.7.3  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
MySQL Server includes some extensions that you probably will not find in
other SQL databases.  Be warned that if you use them, your code will not be
portable to other SQL servers.  In some cases, you can write code that
includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using comments
of the form <CODE>/*! ... */</CODE>.  In this case, MySQL Server will parse and
execute the code within the comment as it would any other MySQL
statement, but other SQL servers will ignore the extensions.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col_name FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you add a version number after the <CODE>'!'</CODE>, the syntax will be
executed only if the MySQL version is equal to or newer than the used
version number:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE /*!32302 TEMPORARY */ TABLE t (a int);
</PRE>

<P>
This means that if you have Version 3.23.02 or newer, MySQL
Server will use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword.

</P>
<P>
The following is a list of MySQL extensions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The field types <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, <CODE>SET</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, and the
different <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types.

<LI>

The field attributes <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, and <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>.

<LI>

All string comparisons are case-insensitive by default, with sort
ordering determined by the current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by
default).  If you don't like this, you should declare your columns with
the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute or use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast, which causes
comparisons to be done according to the ASCII order used on the
MySQL server host.

<LI>

MySQL Server maps each database to a directory under the MySQL
data directory, and tables within a database to filenames in the database
directory.

This has a few implications:

<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>


<UL>

<LI>

Database names and table names are case-sensitive in MySQL Server on
operating systems that have case-sensitive filenames (like most Unix
systems). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI>

Database, table, index, column, or alias names may begin with a digit
(but may not consist solely of digits).

<LI>

You can use standard system commands to back up, rename, move, delete, and copy
tables.  For example, to rename a table, rename the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>, <TT>`.MYI'</TT>,
and <TT>`.frm'</TT> files to which the table corresponds.
</UL>

<LI>

In SQL statements, you can access tables from different databases
with the <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> syntax.  Some SQL servers provide
the same functionality but call this <CODE>User space</CODE>.
MySQL Server doesn't support tablespaces as in:
<CODE>create table ralph.my_table...IN my_tablespace</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric columns.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE> option in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

<CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> to get a description on how tables are joined.

<LI>

Use of index names, indexes on a prefix of a field, and use of
<CODE>INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>KEY</CODE> in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> or <CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT list)</CODE> where <CODE>list</CODE> is more than one element.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>CHANGE col_name</CODE>, <CODE>DROP col_name</CODE>, or <CODE>DROP
INDEX</CODE>, <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> or <CODE>RENAME</CODE> in an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#RENAME_TABLE">6.5.5  <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use of multiple <CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>, or <CODE>CHANGE</CODE>
clauses in an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> with the keywords <CODE>IF EXISTS</CODE>.

<LI>

You can drop multiple tables with a single <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

The <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause of the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

The <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> clause of the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>
statements.

<LI>

The <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> clause of the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<LI>

Use of <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. In many cases, this syntax is compatible with
Oracle's <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, and
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> statements.

<LI>

The <CODE>SHOW</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.6  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Strings may be enclosed by either <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`''</SAMP>, not just by <SAMP>`''</SAMP>.

<LI>

Use of the escape <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.

<LI>

The <CODE>SET</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You don't need to name all selected columns in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part.
This gives better performance for some very specific, but quite normal
queries.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Group_by_functions">6.3.7  Functions for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

One can specify <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

<LI>

To make it easier for users who come from other SQL environments,
MySQL Server supports aliases for many functions. For example, all
string functions support both ANSI SQL syntax and ODBC syntax.

<LI>

MySQL Server understands the <CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> operators to mean
logical OR and AND, as in the C programming language.  In MySQL Server,
<CODE>||</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> are synonyms, as are <CODE>&#38;&</CODE> and <CODE>AND</CODE>.
Because of this nice syntax, MySQL Server doesn't support
the ANSI SQL <CODE>||</CODE> operator for string concatenation; use
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> instead. Because <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> takes any number
of arguments, it's easy to convert use of the <CODE>||</CODE> operator to
MySQL Server.

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_DATABASE">6.5.1  <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<LI>

The <CODE>%</CODE> operator is a synonym for <CODE>MOD()</CODE>.  That is,
<CODE>N % M</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>MOD(N,M)</CODE>.  <CODE>%</CODE> is supported
for C programmers and for compatibility with PostgreSQL.

<LI>

The <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE> ,<CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>,<CODE>&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>AND</CODE>, <CODE>OR</CODE>, or <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
operators may be used in column comparisons to the left of the
<CODE>FROM</CODE> in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col1=1 AND col2=2 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> extended regular expression
operators.

<LI>

<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> or <CODE>CHAR()</CODE> with one argument or more than two
arguments.  (In MySQL Server, these functions can take any number of
arguments.)

<LI>The <CODE>BIT_COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>ELT()</CODE>,

<CODE>FROM_DAYS()</CODE>, <CODE>FORMAT()</CODE>, <CODE>IF()</CODE>, <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>,
<CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE>, <CODE>MD5()</CODE>, <CODE>ENCODE()</CODE>, <CODE>DECODE()</CODE>,
<CODE>PERIOD_ADD()</CODE>, <CODE>PERIOD_DIFF()</CODE>, <CODE>TO_DAYS()</CODE>, or
<CODE>WEEKDAY()</CODE> functions.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>TRIM()</CODE> to trim substrings. ANSI SQL only supports removal
of single characters.

<LI>

The <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> functions <CODE>STD()</CODE>, <CODE>BIT_OR()</CODE>, and
<CODE>BIT_AND()</CODE>.

<LI>

Use of <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> instead of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> + <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPLACE">6.4.8  <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>FLUSH</CODE>, <CODE>RESET</CODE> and <CODE>DO</CODE> statements.

<LI>

The ability to set variables in a statement with <CODE>:=</CODE>:

<PRE>
SELECT @a:=SUM(total),@b=COUNT(*),@a/@b AS avg FROM test_table;
SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;
</PRE>

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Differences_from_ANSI" HREF="manual_toc.html#Differences_from_ANSI">1.7.4  MySQL Differences Compared to ANSI SQL92</A></H3>

<P>
We try to make MySQL Server follow the ANSI SQL standard and the
ODBC SQL standard, but in some cases MySQL Server does things
differently:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, trailing spaces are removed when the value is
stored. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bugs">1.7.5  Known Errors and Design Deficiencies in MySQL</A>.

<LI>

In some cases, <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns are silently changed to <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
columns. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

<LI>

Privileges for a table are not automatically revoked when you delete a
table. You must explicitly issue a <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> to revoke privileges for
a table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>NULL AND FALSE</CODE> will evaluate to <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not to <CODE>FALSE</CODE>.
This is because we don't think it's good to have to evaluate a lot of
extra conditions in this case.
</UL>

<P>
For a prioritised list indicating when new extensions will be added to
MySQL Server, you should consult the online MySQL TODO list at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/TODO.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/TODO.html</a>.
That is the latest version of the TODO list in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TODO">1.8  MySQL and The Future (The TODO)</A>.

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_Sub-selects" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_Sub-selects">1.7.4.1  Sub<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL Server until version 4.0 only supports nested queries of the form
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
You can, however, use the function <CODE>IN()</CODE> in other contexts.
Subqueries have been implemented in the 4.1 development tree.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, you can often rewrite the query without a subquery:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
</PRE>

<P>
This can be rewritten as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id=table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
The queries:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM table2
                                       WHERE table1.id=table2.id);
</PRE>

<P>
Can be rewritten as:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT table1.* FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
                                       WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
For more complicated subqueries you can often create temporary tables
to hold the subquery.  In some cases, however, this option will not
work. The most frequently encountered of these cases arises with
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements, for which standard SQL does not support joins
(except in subqueries).  For this situation there are two options
available until subqueries are supported by MySQL Server.

</P>
<P>
The first option is to use a procedural programming language (such as
Perl or PHP) to submit a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query to obtain the primary keys
for the records to be deleted, and then use these values to construct
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (<CODE>DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... IN (key1,
key2, ...)</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
The second option is to use interactive SQL to construct a set of
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements automatically, using the MySQL
extension <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> (in lieu of the standard <CODE>||</CODE> operator).
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CONCAT('DELETE FROM tab1 WHERE pkid = ', "'", tab1.pkid, "'", ';')
  FROM tab1, tab2
 WHERE tab1.col1 = tab2.col2;
</PRE>

<P>
You can place this query in a script file and redirect input from it to
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line interpreter, piping its output back to a
second instance of the interpreter:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --skip-column-names mydb &#60; myscript.sql | mysql mydb
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL Server 4.0 supports multi-table deletes that can be used to
efficiently delete rows based on information from one table or even

MySQL Server supports transactions with the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE>
<CODE>Transactional table handlers</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> provides <CODE>ACID</CODE> compliancy.

</P>
<P>
However, the non-transactional table types in MySQL Server such as
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> follow another paradigm for data integrity called
``<CODE>Atomic Operations</CODE>.'' Atomic operations often offer equal or
even better integrity with much better performance.
With MySQL Server supporting both paradigms, the user is able to decide if
he needs the speed of atomic operations or if he need to use
transactional features in his applications. This choice can be made
on a per-table basis.

</P>
<P>
How does one use the features of MySQL Server to maintain rigorous integrity
and how do these features compare with the transactional paradigm?

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

In the transactional paradigm, if your applications are written in a
way that is dependent on the calling of <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> instead of
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> in critical situations, transactions are more
convenient. Transactions also ensure that unfinished updates or
corrupting activities are not committed to the database; the server is
given the opportunity to do an automatic rollback and your database is
saved.

MySQL Server, in almost all cases, allows you to resolve potential problems
by including simple checks before updates and by running simple scripts
that check the databases for inconsistencies and automatically repair
or warn if such an inconsistency occurs. Note that just by using the
MySQL log or even adding one extra log, one can normally fix tables
perfectly with no data integrity loss.

<LI>

More often than not, fatal transactional updates can be rewritten to be
atomic. Generally speaking, all integrity problems that transactions
solve can be done with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or atomic updates, ensuring
that you never will get an automatic abort from the database, which is
a common problem with transactional databases.

<LI>

Even a transactional system can lose data if the server goes down.
The difference between different systems lies in just how small the
time-lap is where they could lose data. No system is 100% secure, only
``secure enough.'' Even Oracle, reputed to be the safest of
transactional databases, is reported to sometimes lose data in such
situations.

To be safe with MySQL Server, whether using transactional tables or not, you
only need to have backups and have the update logging turned on. With
this you can recover from any situation that you could with any
other transactional database.  It is, of course, always good to have
backups, independent of which database you use.
</OL>

<P>
The transactional paradigm has its benefits and its drawbacks. Many
users and application developers depend on the ease with which they
can code around problems where an abort appears to be, or is necessary.
However, even if you are new to the atomic operations paradigm, or more
familiar with transactions, do consider the speed benefit that
non-transactional tables can offer on the order of three to five times
the speed of the fastest and most optimally tuned transactional tables.

</P>
<P>
In situations where integrity is of highest importance, MySQL Server offers
transaction-level or better reliability and integrity even for
non-transactional tables.
If you lock tables with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, all updates will stall
until any integrity checks are made. If you only obtain a read lock
(as opposed to a write lock), reads and inserts are still allowed
to happen. The new inserted records will not be seen by any of the
clients that have a read lock until they release their read
locks. With <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> you can queue inserts into a local
queue, until the locks are released, without having the client wait
for the insert to complete. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.4  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
``Atomic,'' in the sense that we mean it, is nothing magical. It only
means that you can be sure that while each specific update is running,
no other user can interfere with it, and there will never be an
automatic rollback (which can happen with transactional tables if you
are not very careful).  MySQL Server also guarantees that there will not be
any dirty reads.

</P>
<P>
Following are some techniques for working with non-transactional tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Loops that need transactions normally can be coded with the help of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, and you don't need cursors when you can update
records on the fly.

<LI>

To avoid using <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, you can use the following strategy:


<OL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOCK TABLES ...</CODE> to lock all the tables you want to access.
<LI>

Test conditions.
<LI>

Update if everything is okay.
<LI>

Use <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> to release your locks.
</OL>

This is usually a much faster method than using transactions with
possible <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>s, although not always. The only situation
this solution doesn't handle is when someone kills the threads in the
middle of an update. In this case, all locks will be released but some
of the updates may not have been executed.

<LI>

You can also use functions to update records in a single operation.
You can get a very efficient application by using the following
techniques:


<UL>
<LI>Modify fields relative to their current value.

<LI>Update only those fields that actually have changed.

</UL>

For example, when we are doing updates to some customer information, we
update only the customer data that has changed and test only that none of
the changed data, or data that depends on the changed data, has changed
compared to the original row. The test for changed data is done with the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement. If the record wasn't
updated, we give the client a message: "Some of the data you have changed
has been changed by another user." Then we show the old row versus the new
row in a window, so the user can decide which version of the customer record
he should use.

This gives us something that is similar to column locking but is actually
even better because we only update some of the columns, using values that
are relative to their current values.  This means that typical <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements look something like these:


<PRE>
UPDATE tablename SET pay_back=pay_back+'relative change';

UPDATE customer
  SET
    customer_date='current_date',
    address='new address',
    phone='new phone',
    money_he_owes_us=money_he_owes_us+'new_money'
  WHERE
    customer_id=id AND address='old address' AND phone='old phone';
</PRE>

As you can see, this is very efficient and works even if another client
has changed the values in the <CODE>pay_back</CODE> or <CODE>money_he_owes_us</CODE>
columns.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
In many cases, users have wanted <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> and/or <CODE>LOCK
TABLES</CODE> for the purpose of managing unique identifiers for some tables.
This can be handled much more efficiently by using an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column and either the SQL function
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> or the C API function <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
You can generally code around row-level locking. Some situations really
need it, but they are very few. <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support row-level
locking. With MyISAM, you can use a flag column in the table and do
something like the following:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID;
</PRE>

MySQL returns 1 for the number of affected rows if the row was
found and <CODE>row_flag</CODE> wasn't already 1 in the original row.

You can think of it as though MySQL Server changed the preceding query to:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET row_flag=1 WHERE id=ID AND row_flag &#60;&#62; 1;
</PRE>

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_Triggers" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_Triggers">1.7.4.4  Stored Procedures and Triggers</A></H4>

<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>

</P>
<P>
A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored
in the server. Once this has been done, clients don't need to keep re-issuing
the entire query but can refer to the stored procedure. This provides better
performance because the query has to be parsed only once, and less information
needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also raise the
conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server.

</P>
<P>
A trigger is a stored procedure that is invoked when a particular event
occurs.  For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered
each time a record is deleted from a transaction table and that automatically
deletes the corresponding customer from a customer table when all his
transactions are deleted.

</P>
<P>
The planned update language will be able to handle stored procedures.
Our aim is to have stored procedures implemented in MySQL Server around
version 5.0. We are also looking at triggers.

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys">1.7.4.5  Foreign Keys</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>

</P>
<P>
Note that foreign keys in SQL are not used to join tables, but are used
mostly for checking referential integrity (foreign key constraints).  If
you want to get results from multiple tables from a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, you do this by joining tables:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM table1,table2 WHERE table1.id = table2.id;
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#example-Foreign_keys">3.5.6  Using Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Server 3.23.44 and up, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>. For other table types, MySQL Server
does parse the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
commands, but without further action being taken.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax without <CODE>ON DELETE ...</CODE> is mostly
used for documentation purposes. Some ODBC applications may use this
to produce automatic <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses, but this is usually easy to
override. <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> is sometimes used as a constraint check,
but this check is unnecessary in practice if rows are inserted into the
tables in the right order.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Server, you can work around the problem of <CODE>ON DELETE ...</CODE> not
being implemented by adding the appropriate <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement to
an application when you delete records from a table that has a foreign
key. In practice this is as quick (in some cases quicker) and much more
portable than using foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Server 4.0 you can use multi-table delete to delete rows from many
tables with one command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DELETE">6.4.6  <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the near future we will extend the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> implementation
so that the information will be saved in the table specification file
and may be retrieved by <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and ODBC. At a later stage we
will implement the foreign key constraints for applications that can't
easily be coded to avoid them.

</P>
<P>
Do keep in mind that foreign keys are often misused, which can cause
severe problems. Even when used properly, it is not a magic solution for
the referential integrity problem, although it does make things easier
in some cases.

</P>
<P>
Some advantages of foreign key enforcement:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Assuming proper design of the relations, foreign key constraints will
make it more difficult for a programmer to introduce an inconsistency
into the database.

<LI>

Using cascading updates and deletes can simplify the client code.

<LI>

Properly designed foreign key rules aid in documenting relations
between tables.
</UL>

<P>
Disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mistakes, which are easy to make in designing key relations, can cause
severe problems@-for example, circular rules, or the wrong combination
of cascading deletes.

<LI>

A properly written application will make sure internally that it is
not violating referential integrity constraints before proceding with
a query. Thus, additional checks on the database level will only slow
down performance for such an application.

<LI>

It is not uncommon for a DBA to make such a complex topology of
relations that it becomes very difficult, and in some cases impossible,
to back up or restore individual tables.

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_Views" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_Views">1.7.4.6  Views</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>

</P>
<P>
It is planned to implement views in MySQL Server around version 5.0.

</P>
<P>
Views are mostly useful for letting users access a set of relations as one
table (in read-only mode).  Many SQL databases don't allow one to update
any rows in a view, but you have to do the updates in the separate tables.

</P>
<P>
As MySQL Server is mostly used in applications and on web systems where
the application writer has full control on the database usage, most of
our users haven't regarded views to be very important.
(At least no one has been interested enough in this to be prepared to
finance the implementation of views.)

</P>
<P>
One doesn't need views in MySQL Server to restrict access to columns,
as MySQL Server has a very sophisticated privilege system.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

<H4><A NAME="ANSI_diff_comments" HREF="manual_toc.html#ANSI_diff_comments">1.7.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>

</P>
<P>
Some other SQL databases use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> to start comments.
MySQL Server has <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the start comment character. You can also use
the C comment style <CODE>/* this is a comment */</CODE> with MySQL Server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Comments">6.1.6  Comment Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Server Version 3.23.3 and above support the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> comment style,
provided the comment is followed by a space.  This is because this
comment style has caused many problems with automatically generated
SQL queries that have used something like the following code, where
we automatically insert the value of the payment for
<CODE>!payment!</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET credit=credit-!payment!
</PRE>

<P>
Think about what happens if the value of <CODE>payment</CODE> is negative.
Because <CODE>1--1</CODE> is legal in SQL, the consequences of allowing
comments to start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> are terrible.

</P>
<P>
Using our implementation of this method of commenting in MySQL Server
Version 3.23.3 and up, <CODE>1-- This is a comment</CODE> is actually safe.

</P>
<P>
Another safe feature is that the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client
removes all lines that start with <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>.

</P>

<P>
The following information is relevant only if you are running a
MySQL version earlier than 3.23.3:

</P>
<P>
If you have a SQL program in a text file that contains <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments you should use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql \
         | mysql database
</PRE>

<P>
instead of the usual:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; text-file-with-funny-comments.sql

<P>
You can also edit the command file ``in place'' to change the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP>
comments to <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> comments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; replace " --" " #" -- text-file-with-funny-comments.sql

The following known errors/bugs are not fixed in MySQL 3.23 because fixing
them would involves changing a lot of code which could introduce other
even worse bugs. The bugs are also classified as 'not fatal' or
'bearable'.

<UL>
<LI>

One can get a deadlock when doing <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> on multiple tables
and then in the same connection doing a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on one of
them while another thread is trying to lock the table.  One can however
do a <CODE>KILL</CODE> on any of the involved threads to resolve this.
Fixed in 4.0.12.

<CODE>SELECT MAX(key_column) FROM t1,t2,t3...</CODE> where one of the tables are
empty doesn't return <CODE>NULL</CODE> but instead the maximum value for the

<P>
The following problems are known and have a high priority to get fixed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> on a BDB table may in some case make the table
unusable until one has restarted <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  When this happens you will
see errors like the following in the MySQL error file:


<PRE>
001207 22:07:56  bdb:  log_flush: LSN past current end-of-log
</PRE>

<LI>

Don't execute <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table on which you are
running multi-statement transactions until all those transactions complete.
(The transaction will probably be ignored.)

<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, and <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> may
cause problems on tables for which you are using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.

<LI>

Doing a <CODE>LOCK TABLE ...</CODE> and <CODE>FLUSH TABLES ...</CODE> doesn't
guarantee that there isn't a half-finished transaction in progress on the
table.

<LI>

BDB tables are a bit slow to open. If you have many BDB tables in a
database, it will take a long time to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client on the
database if you are not using the <CODE>-A</CODE> option or if you are using
<CODE>rehash</CODE>. This is especially notable when you have a big table
cache.

</UL>

<P>
The following problems are known and will be fixed in due time:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

When using <CODE>RPAD</CODE> function, or any other string function that ends
up adding blanks to the right, in a query that has to use temporary
table to be resolved, then all resulting strings will be RTRIM'ed. This
is an example of the query:

<CODE>SELECT    RPAD(t1.field1, 50, ' ') AS f2,    RPAD(t2.field2, 50, '
') AS f1  FROM    table1 as t1     LEFT JOIN table2 AS t2 ON
t1.record=t2.joinID ORDER BY t2.record;</CODE> 

Final result of this bug is that use will not be able to get blanks on
the right side of the resulting field. 

The above behaviour exists in all versions of MySQL. 

The reason for this is due to the fact that HEAP tables, which are used
first for temporary tables, are not capable of handling VARCHAR columns.

This behaviour will be fixed in one of 4.1 releases.

<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE>, one can't use translated
characters in database, table, and column names.

<LI>

One can't use <CODE>_</CODE> or <CODE>%</CODE> with <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> in <CODE>LIKE
... ESCAPE</CODE>.

<LI>

If you have a <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> column with a  number stored in different
formats (+01.00, 1.00, 01.00), <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> may regard each value
as a different value.

<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables.

<LI>

You cannot build the server in another directory when using
MIT-pthreads. Because this requires changes to MIT-pthreads, we are not
likely to fix this. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> values can't ``reliably'' be used in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>. Only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE>
bytes (default 1024) are used when comparing <CODE>BLOB</CODE>s in these cases.
This can be changed with the <CODE>-O max_sort_length</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. A workaround for most cases is to use a substring:
<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(blob,2048) FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<LI>

Calculation is done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> (both are
normally 64 bits long). It depends on the function which precision one
gets. The general rule is that bit functions are done with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>
precision, <CODE>IF</CODE>, and <CODE>ELT()</CODE> with <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
precision and the rest with <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> precision.  One should try to
avoid using unsigned long long values if they resolve to be bigger than
63 bits (9223372036854775807) for anything else than bit fields!
MySQL Server 4.0 has better <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> handling than 3.23.

<LI>

All string columns, except <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, automatically
have all trailing spaces removed when retrieved. For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> types this
is okay, and may be regarded as a feature according to ANSI SQL92. The bug is
that in MySQL Server, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are treated the same way.

<LI>

You can only have up to 255 <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns in one table.

<LI>

In <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.

<LI>

<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> redirects all messages from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> log.  One problem with this is that if you execute
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> to close and reopen the log,
<CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE> are still redirected to the old log.
If you use <CODE>--log</CODE> extensively, you should edit <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to
log to <TT>`'hostname'.err'</TT> instead of <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT> so you can
easily reclaim the space for the old log by deleting the old one and
executing <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

<LI>

In the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, columns are updated from left to right.  If
you refer to an updated column, you will get the updated value instead of the
original value. For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1,KEY=KEY+1;
</PRE>

This will update <CODE>KEY</CODE> with <CODE>2</CODE> instead of with <CODE>1</CODE>.

<LI>

You can't use temporary tables more than once in the same query.
For example, the following doesn't work:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM temporary_table, temporary_table AS t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>RENAME</CODE> doesn't work with <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> tables or tables used in a
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

<LI>

The optimiser may handle <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> differently if you are using
'hidden' columns in a join or not.  In a join, hidden columns are
counted as part of the result (even if they are not shown) while in
normal queries hidden columns don't participate in the <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
comparison.  We will probably change this in the future to never compare
the hidden columns when executing <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>.

An example of this is:


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT mp3id FROM band_downloads
       WHERE userid = 9 ORDER BY id DESC;
</PRE>

and


<PRE>
SELECT DISTINCT band_downloads.mp3id
       FROM band_downloads,band_mp3
       WHERE band_downloads.userid = 9
       AND band_mp3.id = band_downloads.mp3id
       ORDER BY band_downloads.id DESC;
</PRE>

In the second case you may in MySQL Server 3.23.x get two identical rows
in the result set (because the hidden <CODE>id</CODE> column may differ).

Note that this happens only for queries where you don't have the
ORDER BY columns in the result, something that you are not allowed
to do in ANSI SQL.

<LI>

Because MySQL Server allows you to work with table types that don't
support transactions, and thus can't <CODE>rollback</CODE> data, some things
behave a little differently in MySQL Server than in other SQL servers.
This is just to ensure that MySQL Server never needs to do a rollback
for a SQL command.  This may be a little awkward at times as column
values must be checked in the application, but this will actually give
you a nice speed increase as it allows MySQL Server to do some
optimisations that otherwise would be very hard to do.

If you set a column to an incorrect value, MySQL Server will, instead of
doing a rollback, store the <CODE>best possible value</CODE> in the column:


<UL>
<LI>

If you try to store a value outside the range in a numerical column,
MySQL Server will instead store the smallest or biggest possible value in
the column.

<LI>

If you try to store a string that doesn't start with a number into a
numerical column, MySQL Server will store 0 into it.

<LI>

If you try to store <CODE>NULL</CODE> into a column that doesn't take
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, MySQL Server will store 0 or <CODE>''</CODE> (empty
string) in it instead. (This behaviour can, however, be changed with the
-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS compile option.)

<LI>

MySQL allows you to store some wrong date values into <CODE>DATE</CODE> and
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns (like 2000-02-31 or 2000-02-00).  The idea is
that it's not the SQL server job to validate date.  If MySQL can store a
date and retrieve exactly the same date, then MySQL will store the
date. If the date is totally wrong (outside the server's ability to store
it), then the special date value 0000-00-00 will be stored in the column.

<LI>

If you set an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column to an unsupported value, it will be set to
the error value <CODE>empty string</CODE>, with numeric value 0.

<LI>

If you set a <CODE>SET</CODE> column to an unsupported value, the value will
be ignored.

</UL>

<LI>

If you execute a <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> on a query that returns an empty set,
in some cases the <CODE>PROCEDURE</CODE> will not transform the columns.

<LI>

Creation of a table of type <CODE>MERGE</CODE> doesn't check if the underlying
tables are of compatible types.

<LI>

MySQL Server can't yet handle <CODE>NaN</CODE>, <CODE>-Inf</CODE>, and <CODE>Inf</CODE>
values in double. Using these will cause problems when trying to export
and import data. We should as an intermediate solution change <CODE>NaN</CODE> to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (if possible) and <CODE>-Inf</CODE> and <CODE>Inf</CODE> to the
minimum respective maximum possible <CODE>double</CODE> value.

<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> on negative numbers are treated as big positive numbers.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to first add a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index to a
table used in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and then use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
add a normal index on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old key that was not unique in the
table. This is because <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> puts <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys before
normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
</UL>

<P>
The following are known bugs in earlier versions of MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can get a hung thread if you do a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is
one among many tables that is locked with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

In the following case you can get a core dump:


<UL>
<LI>

Delayed insert handler has pending inserts to a table.

<LI>

<CODE>LOCK table</CODE> with <CODE>WRITE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

Before MySQL Server Version 3.23.2 an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that updated a key with
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> on the same key may have failed because the key was used to
search for records and the same row may have been found multiple times:


<PRE>
UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY &#62; 100;
</PRE>

A workaround is to use:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name SET KEY=KEY+1 WHERE KEY+0 &#62; 100;
</PRE>

This will work because MySQL Server will not use an index on expressions in
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Before MySQL Server Version 3.23, all numeric types where treated as
fixed-point fields. That means you had to specify how many decimals
a floating-point field shall have. All results were returned with the
correct number of decimals.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>

</P>

<P>
This section lists the features that we plan to implement in MySQL Server.

</P>
<P>
Everything in this list is approximately in the order it will be done.  If you
want to affect the priority order, please register a license or support us and
tell us what you want to have done more quickly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Licensing_and_Support">1.4  MySQL Support and Licensing</A>.

</P>
<P>
The plan is that we in the future will support the full ANSI SQL99
standard, but with a lot of useful extensions. The challenge is to do
this without sacrificing the speed or compromising the code.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_4.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_4.0">1.8.1  Things That Should be in 4.0</A></H3>

<P>
All done. We now only do bug fixes for MySQL 4.0. See section <A HREF="manual.html#News-4.0.x">D.3  Changes in release 4.0.x (Gamma)</A>.
Development has shifted to 4.1 &#38; 5.0

</P>


<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_4.1" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_4.1">1.8.2  Things That Should be in 4.1</A></H3>

<P>
The following features are planned for inclusion into MySQL 4.1.
For a list what is already done in MySQL 4.1, see See section <A HREF="manual.html#News-4.1.x">D.2  Changes in release 4.1.x (Alpha)</A>.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stable OpenSSL support (MySQL 4.0 supports rudimentary, not 100% tested,
support for OpenSSL).
<LI>

Character set casts and syntax for handling multiple character sets.
<LI>

Help for all commands from the client.
<LI>

More testing of prepared statements and multiple characters sets for one
table.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_MySQL_5.0" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_MySQL_5.0">1.8.3  Things That Should be in 5.0</A></H3>

<P>
The following features are planned for inclusion into MySQL 5.0.
Note that because we have many developers that are working on different

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stored procedures.
<LI>

Foreign keys support for all table types.
<LI>

New text based table definition file format (<TT>`.frm'</TT> files) and a
table cache for table definitions.  This will enable us to do faster
queries of table structures and do more efficient foreign key support.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name</CODE> (used by <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to allow
expansions of column names) should not open the table, only the
definition file. This will require less memory and be much faster.
<LI>

Fail-safe replication.
<LI>

Online backup with very low performance penalty.  The online backup will
make it easy to add a new replication slave without taking down the
master.
<LI>

<CODE>ROLLUP</CODE> and <CODE>CUBE</CODE> OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) grouping
options for data warehousing applications.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>DELETE</CODE> on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables to use the record cache.
To do this, we need to update the threads record cache when we update
the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file.
<LI>

When using <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> we should translate the whole query
at once and not only strings. This will enable users to use the translated
characters in database, table, and column names.
<LI>

Resolving the issue of <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> on a table used in an active
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table possibly corrupting the table.
<LI>

Add options to the client/server protocol to get progress notes
for long running commands.
<LI>

Implement <CODE>RENAME DATABASE</CODE>. To make this safe for all storage engines,
it should work as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

Create the new database.
<LI>

For every table do a rename of the table to another database, as
we do with the <CODE>RENAME</CODE> command.
<LI>

Drop the old database.
</UL>

<LI>

Add true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> support (there is already support for this in
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).
<LI>

Optimise <CODE>BIT</CODE> type to take 1 bit (now <CODE>BIT</CODE> takes 1 char).
<LI>

New internal file interface change.  This will make all file handling much
more general and make it easier to add extensions like RAID.
(the current implementation is a hack.)
<LI>

Better in-memory (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>) tables:

<UL>
<LI>

Dynamic size rows.
<LI>

Faster row handling (less copying)
</UL>

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_future" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_future">1.8.4  Things That Must be Done in the Near Future</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Don't allow more than a defined number of threads to run MyISAM recover
at the same time.
<LI>

Change <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> to optionally use concurrent inserts.
<LI>

Return the original field types() when doing <CODE>SELECT MIN(column)
... GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Multiple result sets.
<LI>

Make it possible to specify <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> with a granularity
in microseconds.
<LI>

Link the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> code into the server.
<LI>

Port of the MySQL code to QNX.
<LI>

Port of the MySQL code to BeOS.
<LI>

Port of the MySQL clients to LynxOS.
<LI>

Add a temporary key buffer cache during <CODE>INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE</CODE> so that we
can gracefully recover if the index file gets full.
<LI>

If you perform an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a table that is symlinked to another
disk, create temporary tables on this disk.
<LI>

Implement a <CODE>DATE/DATETIME</CODE> type that handles time zone information
properly so that dealing with dates in different time zones is easier.
<LI>

FreeBSD and MIT-pthreads; do sleeping threads take CPU time?
<LI>

Check if locked threads take any CPU time.
<LI>

Fix configure so that one can compile all libraries (like <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>)
without threads.
<LI>

Add an option to periodically flush key pages for tables with delayed keys
if they haven't been used in a while.
<LI>

Allow join on key parts (optimisation issue).
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT SQL_CONCURRENT</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld --concurrent-insert</CODE> to do
a concurrent insert at the end of the file if the file is read-locked.
<LI>

Server-side cursors.
<LI>

Check if <CODE>lockd</CODE> works with modern Linux kernels; if not, we have
to fix <CODE>lockd</CODE>!  To test this, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--enable-locking</CODE> and run the different fork* test suits. They shouldn't
give any errors if <CODE>lockd</CODE> works.
<LI>

Allow SQL variables in <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, like in <CODE>LIMIT @a,@b</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow update of variables in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements. For example:
<CODE>UPDATE TABLE foo SET @a=a+b,a=@a, b=@a+c</CODE>.
<LI>

Change when user variables are updated so that one can use them with
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, as in the following example:
<CODE>SELECT id, @a:=COUNT(*), SUM(sum_col)/@a FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>.
<LI>

Don't add automatic <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values to columns.  Give an error when using
an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> that doesn't contain a column that doesn't have a
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix <TT>`libmysql.c'</TT> to allow two <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> commands in a row
without reading results or give a nice error message when one does this.
<LI>

Check why MIT-pthreads <CODE>ctime()</CODE> doesn't work on some FreeBSD systems.
<LI>

Add an <CODE>IMAGE</CODE> option to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to not update
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> and <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> fields.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LOAD DATE INFILE ... UPDATE</CODE> syntax.

<UL>
<LI>

For tables with primary keys, if the data contains the primary key,
entries matching that primary key are updated from the remainder of the
columns. However, columns <STRONG>missing</STRONG> from the incoming data feed are not
touched.
<LI>

For tables with primary keys that are missing some part of the key
in the incoming data stream, or that have no primary key, the feed is
treated as a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ... REPLACE INTO</CODE> now.
</UL>

<LI>

Make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> understand syntax like:

<PRE>
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
     TEXT_FIELDS (text_field1, text_field2, text_field3)
     SET table_field1=CONCAT(text_field1, text_field2),
         table_field3=23
     IGNORE text_field3
</PRE>

This can be used to skip over extra columns in the text file,
or update columns based on expressions of the read data.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' INTO TABLE 'table_name' ERRORS TO err_table_name</CODE>.
This would cause any errors and warnings to be logged into the
<CODE>err_table_name</CODE> table. That table would have a structure like:


<PRE>
line_number    - line number in datafile
error_message  - the error/warning message
and maybe
data_line      - the line from the datafile
</PRE>

<LI>

Automatic output from <CODE>mysql</CODE> to Netscape.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK DATABASES</CODE> (with various options.)
<LI>

Functions:
ADD_TO_SET(value,set) and REMOVE_FROM_SET(value,set).
<LI>

Add use of <CODE>t1 JOIN t2 ON ...</CODE> and <CODE>t1 JOIN t2 USING ...</CODE>
Currently, you can only use this syntax with <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.
<LI>

Many more variables for <CODE>show status</CODE>.  Records reads and
updates.  Selects on 1 table and selects with joins.  Mean number of
tables in select. Number of <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries.
<LI>

If you abort <CODE>mysql</CODE> in the middle of a query, you should open
another connection and kill the old running query.
Alternatively, an attempt should be made to detect this in the server.
<LI>

Add a storage engine interface for table information so that you can use it as a system
table. This would be a bit slow if you requested information about all tables,
but very flexible.  <CODE>SHOW INFO FROM tbl_name</CODE> for basic table information
should be implemented.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>SELECT a FROM crash_me LEFT JOIN crash_me2 USING (a)</CODE>; in this
case <CODE>a</CODE> is assumed to come from the <CODE>crash_me</CODE> table.
<LI>

<LI>

Oracle-like <CODE>CONNECT BY PRIOR ...</CODE> to search hierarchy structures.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin copy database new-database</CODE>; requires <CODE>COPY</CODE>
command to be added to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Processlist should show number of queries/threads.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW HOSTS</CODE> for printing information about the hostname cache.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> options to the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
(this will delete rows when one gets a duplicate key error while updating).
<LI>

Change the format of <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> to store fractions of seconds.
<LI>

Add all missing ANSI92 and ODBC 3.0 types.
<LI>

Change table names from empty strings to <CODE>NULL</CODE> for calculated columns.
<LI>

Don't use <CODE>Item_copy_string</CODE> on numerical values to avoid
number-&#62;string-&#62;number conversion in case of:
<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)*(id+0) FROM table_name GROUP BY id</CODE>
<LI>

Make it possible to use the new GNU regexp library instead of the current
one (the GNU library should be much faster than the old one).
<LI>

Change so that <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> doesn't abort clients
that execute <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix so that when columns are referenced in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> clause,
they contain the old values from before the update started.
<LI>

Add simulation of <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE> on Windows to enable
concurrent inserts.
<LI>

A logfile analyser that could parse out information about which tables
are hit most often, how often multi-table joins are executed, etc.  It
should help users identify areas or table design that could be optimised
to execute much more efficient queries.
<LI>

Add <CODE>SUM(DISTINCT)</CODE>.
<LI>

Add <CODE>ANY()</CODE>, <CODE>EVERY()</CODE>, and <CODE>SOME()</CODE> group functions. In
ANSI SQL these work only on boolean columns, but we can extend these to
work on any columns/expressions by applying: value == 0 -&#62; FALSE and
value &#60;&#62; 0 -&#62; TRUE.
<LI>

Fix that the type for <CODE>MAX(column)</CODE> is the same as the column type:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t1 (a DATE);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NOW());
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE t2 SELECT MAX(a) FROM t1;
mysql&#62; SHOW COLUMNS FROM t2;
</PRE>

<LI>

Come up with a nice syntax for a statement that will <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> the row
if it exists and <CODE>INSERT</CODE> a new row if the row didn't exist
(like <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> works with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> / <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="TODO_sometime" HREF="manual_toc.html#TODO_sometime">1.8.5  Things That Have to be Done Sometime</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Implement function: <CODE>get_changed_tables(timeout,table1,table2,...)</CODE>.
<LI>

Change reading through tables to use memmap when possible. Now only
compressed tables use memmap.
<LI>

Make the automatic timestamp code nicer.  Add timestamps to the update
log with <CODE>SET TIMESTAMP=#;</CODE>.
<LI>

Use read/write mutex in some places to get more speed.
<LI>

Full foreign key support in for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, probably after
the implementation of stored procedures with triggers.
<LI>

Simple views (first on one table, later on any expression).
<LI>

Automatically close some tables if a table, temporary table, or temporary files
gets error 23 (not enough open files).
<LI>

When one finds a field=#, change all occurrences of field to #.  Now this
is only done for some simple cases.
<LI>

Change all const expressions with calculated expressions if possible.
<LI>

Optimise key = expression. At the moment only key = field or key =
constant are optimised.
<LI>

Join some of the copy functions for nicer code.
<LI>

Change <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to an inline parser to reduce its size and get
better error messages (5 days).
<LI>

Change the parser to use only one rule per different number of arguments
in function.
<LI>

Use of full calculation names in the order part (for ACCESS97).
<LI>

<CODE>MINUS</CODE>, <CODE>INTERSECT</CODE>, and <CODE>FULL OUTER JOIN</CODE>.
(Currently <CODE>UNION</CODE> [in 4.0] and <CODE>LEFT OUTER JOIN</CODE> are supported.)
<LI>

<CODE>SQL_OPTION MAX_SELECT_TIME=#</CODE> to put a time limit on a query.
<LI>

Make the update log write to a database.
<LI>

Add to <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to allow retrieval of data from the end of a result set.
<LI>

Alarm around client connect/read/write functions.
<LI>

Please note the changes to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>: according to FSSTND (which
Debian tries to follow) PID files should go into <TT>`/var/run/&#60;progname&#62;.pid'</TT>
and log files into <TT>`/var/log'</TT>. It would be nice if you could put the
"DATADIR" in the first declaration of "pidfile" and "log", so the
placement of these files can be changed with a single statement.
<LI>

Allow a client to request logging.
<LI>

Add use of <CODE>zlib()</CODE> for <CODE>gzip</CODE>-ed files to <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fix sorting and grouping of <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns (partly solved now).
<LI>

Stored procedures. Triggers are also being looked at.
<LI>

A simple (atomic) update language that
can be used to write loops and such in the MySQL server.
<LI>

Change to use semaphores when counting threads.  One should first implement
a semaphore library to MIT-pthreads.
<LI>

Don't assign a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value when one sets a column to 0.
Use <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Add full support for <CODE>JOIN</CODE> with parentheses.
<LI>

As an alternative for one thread/connection manage a pool of threads
to handle the queries.
<LI>

Allow one to get more than one lock with <CODE>GET_LOCK</CODE>.  When doing this,
one must also handle the possible deadlocks this change will introduce.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Performance</STRONG>
<DD>
For a true comparison of speed, consult the growing MySQL benchmark
suite. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

Because there is no thread creation overhead, a small parser, few
features, and simple security, <CODE>mSQL</CODE> should be quicker at:


<UL>
<LI>

Tests that perform repeated connects and disconnects, running a very
simple query during each connection.

<LI>

<CODE>INSERT</CODE> operations into very simple tables with few columns and keys.

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> on something that isn't an index. (A table scan is very
easy.)
</UL>

Because these operations are so simple, it is hard to be better at
them when you have a higher startup overhead. After the connection
is established, MySQL Server should perform much better.

On the other hand, MySQL Server is much faster than <CODE>mSQL</CODE> (and
most other SQL implementations) on the following:


<UL>
<LI>

Complex <CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations.

<LI>

Retrieving large results (MySQL Server has a better, faster, and safer
protocol).

<LI>

Tables with variable-length strings because MySQL Server has more efficient
handling and can have indexes on <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.

<LI>

Handling tables with many columns.

<LI>

Handling tables with large record lengths.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> with many expressions.

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> on large tables.

<LI>

Handling many connections at the same time. MySQL Server is fully
multi-threaded. Each connection has its own thread, which means that
no thread has to wait for another (unless a thread is modifying
a table another thread wants to access). In <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, once one
connection is established, all others must wait until the first has
finished, regardless of whether the connection is running a query
that is short or long. When the first connection terminates, the
next can be served, while all the others wait again, etc.

<LI>

Joins.
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> can become pathologically slow if you change the order of
tables in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>. In the benchmark suite, a time more than
15,000 times slower than MySQL Server was seen.  This is due to <CODE>mSQL</CODE>'s
lack of a join optimiser to order tables in the optimal order.
However, if you put the tables in exactly the right order in
<CODE>mSQL</CODE>2 and the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is simple and uses index columns,
the join will be relatively fast!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>.

<LI>

Using <CODE>TEXT</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns.
</UL>

<DT><STRONG>SQL Features</STRONG>
<DD>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> and <CODE>HAVING</CODE>.

<CODE>mSQL</CODE> does not support <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> at all.
MySQL Server supports a full <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with both <CODE>HAVING</CODE> and
the following functions: <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>AVG()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>,
<CODE>MAX()</CODE>, <CODE>SUM()</CODE>, and <CODE>STD()</CODE>.  <CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is
optimised to return very quickly if the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves from
one table, no other columns are retrieved, and there is no
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> may take string
arguments.

<LI><CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> with calculations.

MySQL Server can do calculations in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE SET x=x*10+y WHERE x&#60;20;
</PRE>

<LI>Aliasing.

MySQL Server has column aliasing.

<LI>Qualifying column names.

In MySQL Server, if a column name is unique among the tables used in a
query, you do not have to use the full qualifier.

<LI><CODE>SELECT</CODE> with functions.

MySQL Server has many functions (too many to list here; see section <A HREF="manual.html#Functions">6.3  Functions for Use in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>).

That is, how small can you make your tables?

MySQL Server has very precise types, so you can create tables that take
very little space. An example of a useful MySQL datatype is the
<CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE> that is 3 bytes long. If you have 100 million
records, saving even 1 byte per record is very important.

<CODE>mSQL2</CODE> has a more limited set of column types, so it is
more difficult to get small tables.

<DT><STRONG>Stability</STRONG>
<DD>
This is harder to judge objectively. For a discussion of MySQL Server
stability, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Stability">1.2.3  How Stable Is MySQL?</A>.

We have no experience with <CODE>mSQL</CODE> stability, so we cannot say
anything about that.

<DT><STRONG>Price</STRONG>
<DD>
Another important issue is the license. MySQL Server has a
more flexible license than <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, and is also less expensive
than <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.  Whichever product you choose to use, remember to
at least consider paying for a license or e-mail support.

<DT><STRONG>Perl Interfaces</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL Server has basically the same interfaces to Perl as <CODE>mSQL</CODE> with
some added features.

<DT><STRONG>JDBC (Java)</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL Server currently has a lot of different JDBC drivers:


<UL>
<LI>

MySQL Connector/J is a native Java driver.
Version 3.x is released under dual licensing (GPL and commercial).

<LI>

The Resin driver: this is a commercial JDBC driver released under open
source.  <a HREF="http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp">http://www.caucho.com/projects/jdbc-mysql/index.xtp</a>

<LI>

The gwe driver: a Java interface by GWE technologies (not supported anymore).

<LI>

The jms driver: an improved gwe driver by Xiaokun Kelvin ZHU
<a HREF="mailto:X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk">X.Zhu@brad.ac.uk</a> (not supported anymore).

<LI>

The twz driver: a type 4 JDBC driver by Terrence W. Zellers
<a HREF="mailto:zellert@voicenet.com">zellert@voicenet.com</a>.  This is commercial but is free for private
and educational use (not supported anymore).
</UL>

The recommended driver is the mm driver. The Resin driver may also be
good (at least the benchmarks look good), but we haven't received that
much information about this yet.

We know that <CODE>mSQL</CODE> has a JDBC driver, but we have too little
experience with it to compare.

<DT><STRONG>Rate of Development</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL Server has a small core team of developers, but we are quite
used to coding C and C++ very rapidly. Because threads, functions,
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, and so on are still not implemented in <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, it
has a lot of catching up to do. To get some perspective on this, you
can view the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> <TT>`HISTORY'</TT> file for the last year and
compare it with the News section of the MySQL Reference Manual
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>). It should be pretty obvious which one has developed
most rapidly.

<DT><STRONG>Utility Programs</STRONG>
<DD>
Both <CODE>mSQL</CODE> and MySQL Server have many interesting third-party
tools. Because it is very easy to port upward (from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
MySQL Server), almost all the interesting applications that are available for
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> are also available for MySQL Server.

MySQL Server comes with a simple <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE> program that fixes
differences in spelling between <CODE>mSQL</CODE> and MySQL Server for the
most-used C API functions.
For example, it changes instances of <CODE>msqlConnect()</CODE> to
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>. Converting a client program from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
MySQL Server usually requires only minor effort.

</P>
<P>
According to our experience, it doesn't take long to convert tools
such as <CODE>msql-tcl</CODE> and <CODE>msqljava</CODE> that use the
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> C API so that they work with the MySQL C API.

</P>
<P>
The conversion procedure is:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Run the shell script <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE> on the source. This requires
the <CODE>replace</CODE> program, which is distributed with MySQL Server.

<LI>

Compile.

<LI>

Fix all compiler errors.
</OL>

<P>
Differences between the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> C API and the MySQL C API are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL Server uses a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a connection type (<CODE>mSQL</CODE>
uses an <CODE>int</CODE>).

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> takes a pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a
parameter.  It is easy to define one globally or to use <CODE>malloc()</CODE>
to get one.  <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> also takes two parameters for
specifying the user and password.  You may set these to
<CODE>NULL, NULL</CODE> for default use.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> takes the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure as a parameter.
Just add the parameter to your old <CODE>msql_error()</CODE> code if you are
porting old code.

<LI>

MySQL Server returns an error number and a text error message for all
errors. <CODE>mSQL</CODE> returns only a text error message.

<LI>

Some incompatibilities exist as a result of MySQL Server supporting
multiple connections to the server from the same process.

There are enough differences that it is impossible

</P>
<P>
The most significant ways in which the MySQL protocol differs
from the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> protocol are listed here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A message buffer may contain many result rows.

<LI>

The message buffers are dynamically enlarged if the query or the
result is bigger than the current buffer, up to a configurable server
and client limit.

<LI>

All packets are numbered to catch duplicated or missing packets.

<LI>

All column values are sent in ASCII. The lengths of columns and rows
are sent in packed binary coding (1, 2, or 3 bytes).

<LI>

MySQL can read in the result unbuffered (without having to store the
full set in the client).

<LI>

If a single read/write takes more than 30 seconds, the server closes
the connection.

<LI>

If a connection is idle for 8 hours, the server closes the connection.

</P>
<P>
When reading the following, please note that both products are continually
evolving.  We at MySQL AB and the PostgreSQL developers are both working
on making our respective databases as good as possible, so we are both a
serious alternative to any commercial database.

</P>
<P>
The following comparison is made by us at MySQL AB.  We have tried to be
as accurate and fair as possible, but although we know MySQL Server thoroughly,
we don't have a full knowledge of all PostgreSQL features, so we may have
got some things wrong.  We will, however, correct these when they come to our
attention.

</P>
<P>
We would first like to note that PostgreSQL and MySQL Server are both widely used
products, but with different design goals, even if we are both striving
toward ANSI SQL compliancy.  This means that for some applications MySQL Server
is more suited, while for others PostgreSQL is more suited.  When choosing
which database to use, you should first check if the database's feature set
satisfies your application.  If you need raw speed, MySQL Server is probably your
best choice.  If you need some of the extra features that only PostgreSQL
can offer, you should use <CODE>PostgreSQL</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="MySQL-PostgreSQL_goals" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL-PostgreSQL_goals">1.9.2.1  MySQL and PostgreSQL development strategies</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
When adding things to MySQL Server we take pride to do an optimal, definite
solution.  The code should be so good that we shouldn't have any need to
change it in the foreseeable future.  We also do not like to sacrifice
speed for features but instead will do our utmost to find a solution
that will give maximal throughput.  This means that development will take
a little longer, but the end result will be well worth this.  This kind
of development is only possible because all server code are checked by
one of a few (currently two) persons before it's included in the
MySQL server.

</P>
<P>
We at MySQL AB believe in frequent releases to be able to push out new
features quickly to our users.  Because of this we do a new small release
about every three weeks, and a major branch every year.  All releases are
thoroughly tested with our testing tools on a lot of different platforms.

</P>
<P>
PostgreSQL is based on a kernel with lots of contributors. In this setup
it makes sense to prioritise adding a lot of new features, instead of
implementing them optimally, because one can always optimise things
later if there arises a need for this.

</P>
<P>
Another big difference between MySQL Server and PostgreSQL is that
nearly all of the code in the MySQL server is coded by developers that
are employed by MySQL AB and are still working on the server code. The
exceptions are the transaction engines and the regexp library.

</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast to the PostgreSQL code, the majority of
which is coded by a big group of people with different backgrounds.
It was only recently that the PostgreSQL developers announced that their
current developer group had finally had time to take a look at all
the code in the current PostgreSQL release.

</P>
<P>
Both of the aforementioned development methods have their own merits and drawbacks.
We here at MySQL AB think, of course, that our model is better because our
model gives better code consistency, more optimal and reusable code, and
in our opinion, fewer bugs.  Because we are the authors of the MySQL server
code, we are better able to coordinate new features and releases.

<P>
MySQL Server offers the following advantages over PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>MySQL</CODE> Server is generally much faster than PostgreSQL.  MySQL
4.0.1 also has a query cache that can boost up the query speed for
mostly-read-only sites many times.

<LI>

MySQL has a much larger user base than PostgreSQL. Therefore, the code is
tested more and has historically proven more stable than PostgreSQL.
MySQL Server is used more in production environments than PostgreSQL,
mostly thanks to the fact that MySQL AB, formerly TCX DataKonsult AB, has
provided top-quality commercial support for MySQL Server from the day it
was released, whereas until recently PostgreSQL was unsupported.

<LI>

MySQL Server works better on Windows than PostgreSQL does.  MySQL Server
runs as a native Windows application (a service on NT/2000/XP),
while PostgreSQL is run under the <CODE>Cygwin</CODE> emulation.  We have
heard that PostgreSQL is not yet that stable on Windows but we haven't
been able to verify this ourselves.

<LI>

MySQL has more APIs to other languages and is supported by more
existing programs than PostgreSQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Contrib">B  Contributed Programs</A>.

<LI>

MySQL Server works on 24/7 heavy-duty systems.  In most circumstances
you never have to run any cleanups on MySQL Server.  PostgreSQL doesn't
yet support 24/7 systems because you have to run <CODE>VACUUM</CODE>
once in a while to reclaim space from <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
commands and to perform statistics analyses that are critical to get
good performance with PostgreSQL.  <CODE>VACUUM</CODE> is also needed after
adding a lot of new rows to a table.  On a busy system with lots of changes,
<CODE>VACUUM</CODE> must be run very frequently, in the worst cases even
many times a day.  During the <CODE>VACUUM</CODE> run, which may take hours
if the database is big, the database is, from a production standpoint,
practically dead. Please note: in PostgreSQL version 7.2, basic vacuuming
no longer locks tables, thus allowing normal user access during the vacuum.
A new <CODE>VACUUM FULL</CODE> command does old-style vacuum by locking the table
and shrinking the on-disk copy of the table.

<LI>

MySQL replication has been thoroughly tested, and is used by sites like:

<UL>
<LI>Yahoo Finance (<a HREF="http://finance.yahoo.com/">http://finance.yahoo.com/</a>)

<LI>Mobile.de (<a HREF="http://www.mobile.de/">http://www.mobile.de/</a>)

<LI>Slashdot (<a HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">http://www.slashdot.org/</a>)

</UL>

<LI>

Included in the MySQL distribution are two different testing suites,
<TT>`mysql-test-run'</TT> and <CODE>crash-me</CODE>
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php">http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php</a>), as well
as a benchmark suite.  The test system is actively updated with code to
test each new feature and almost all reproduceable bugs that have come to
our attention.  We test MySQL Server with these on a lot of platforms before
every release.  These tests are more sophisticated than anything we have
seen from PostgreSQL, and they ensure that the MySQL Server is kept to a high
standard.

<LI>

There are far more books in print about MySQL Server than about PostgreSQL.
O'Reilly, SAMS, Que, and New Riders are all major publishers with books
about MySQL.  All MySQL features are also documented in the MySQL online
manual because when a new feature is implemented, the MySQL developers
are required to document it before it's included in the source.

<LI>

MySQL Server supports more of the standard ODBC functions than <CODE>PostgreSQL</CODE>.

<LI>

MySQL Server has a much more sophisticated <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

MySQL Server has support for tables without transactions for applications that
need all the speed they can get. The tables may be memory-based, <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
tables or disk based <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

MySQL Server has support for two different storage engines that support
transactions, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, and <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE>.  Because every
transaction engine performs differently under different conditions, this
gives the application writer more options to find an optimal solution for
his or her setup, if need be per individual table.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables gives you a unique way to instantly make a view over
a set of identical tables and use these as one.  This is perfect for
systems where you have log files that you order, for example, by month.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

<LI>

The option to compress read-only tables, but still have direct access to
the rows in the table, gives you better performance by minimising disk
reads.  This is very useful when you are archiving things.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

<LI>

MySQL Server has internal support for full-text search. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.

<LI>

You can access many databases from the same connection (depending, of course,
on your privileges).

<LI>

MySQL Server is coded from the start to be multi-threaded, while
PostgreSQL uses processes.  Context switching and access to common
storage areas is much faster between threads than between separate
processes. This gives MySQL Server a big speed advantage in multi-user
applications and also makes it easier for MySQL Server to take full
advantage of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) systems.

<LI>

MySQL Server has a much more sophisticated privilege system than
PostgreSQL.  While PostgreSQL only supports <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE/DELETE</CODE> grants per user on a database or
a table, MySQL Server allows you to define a full set of different
privileges on the database, table, and column level.  MySQL Server also
allows you to specify the privilege on host and user combinations.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

MySQL Server supports a compressed client/server protocol which improves
performance over slow links.

<LI>

MySQL Server employs a ``storage engine'' concept, and is the only relational
database we know of built around this concept.  This allows different
low-level table types to be called from the SQL engine, and each table
type can be optimised for different performance characteristics.

<LI>

All MySQL table types (except <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>) are implemented as files
(one table per file), which makes it really easy to back up, move, delete,
and even symlink databases and tables, even when the server is down.

<LI>

Tools to repair and optimise <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (the most common
MySQL table type).  A repair tool is only needed when a physical corruption
of a datafile happens, usually from a hardware failure.  It allows a
majority of the data to be recovered.

<LI>

Upgrading MySQL Server is painless.  When you are upgrading MySQL
Server, you don't need to dump/restore your data, as you have to do with
most PostgreSQL upgrades.
</UL>

<P>
Drawbacks with MySQL Server compared to PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The transaction support in MySQL Server is not yet as well tested as
PostgreSQL's system.

<LI>

Because MySQL Server uses threads, which are not yet flawless on many OSes, one
must either use binaries from <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>, or
carefully follow our instructions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A> to get an optimal
binary that works in all cases.

<LI>

Table locking, as used by the non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, is
in many cases faster than page locks, row locks, or versioning.  The
drawback, however, is that if one doesn't take into account how table
locks work, a single long-running query can block a table for updates
for a long time. This can usually be avoided when designing the
application.  If not, one can always switch the trouble table to use one
of the transactional table types. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A>.

<LI>

With UDF (user-defined functions) one can extend MySQL Server with both normal
SQL functions and aggregates, but this is not yet as easy or as flexible
as in PostgreSQL.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_functions">9.2  Adding New Functions to MySQL</A>.

<LI>

Updates that run over multiple tables used to be harder to do in MySQL
Server. However, this has been fixed in MySQL Server 4.0.2 with
multi-table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and in MySQL Server 4.1 with subqueries.
In MySQL Server 4.0 one can use multi-table deletes to delete from many
tables at the same time. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DELETE">6.4.6  <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Other reasons someone may consider using PostgreSQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Standard usage in PostgreSQL is closer to ANSI SQL in some cases.

<LI>

One can speed up PostgreSQL by coding things as stored procedures.

<LI>

For geographical data, R-trees make PostgreSQL better than MySQL Server.
(note: MySQL version 4.1 has R-trees for MyISAM tables).

<LI>

The PostgreSQL optimiser can do some optimisation that the current MySQL
optimiser can't do.  Most notable is doing joins when you don't have the
proper keys in place and doing a join where you are using different keys
combined with OR.  The MySQL benchmark suite at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a> shows you what
kind of constructs you should watch out for when using different
databases.

<LI>

PostgreSQL has a bigger team of developers that contribute to the server.
</UL>

<P>
Drawbacks with PostgreSQL compared to MySQL Server:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>VACUUM</CODE> makes PostgreSQL hard to use in a 24/7 environment.

<LI>

Only transactional tables.

<LI>

Much slower <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

<H4><A NAME="MySQL-PostgreSQL_benchmarks" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL-PostgreSQL_benchmarks">1.9.2.3  Benchmarking MySQL and PostgreSQL</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>

</P>
<P>
The only <CODE>Open Source</CODE> benchmark that we know of that can be used to
benchmark MySQL Server and PostgreSQL (and other databases) is our own. It can
be found at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
We have many times asked the PostgreSQL developers and some PostgreSQL
users to help us extend this benchmark to make it the definitive benchmark
for databases, but unfortunately we haven't gotten any feedback for this.

</P>
<P>
We, the MySQL developers, have, because of this, spent a lot of hours to get
maximum performance from PostgreSQL for the benchmarks, but because we
don't know PostgreSQL intimately, we are sure that there are things that
we have missed.  We have on the benchmark page documented exactly how we
did run the benchmark so that it should be easy for anyone to repeat and
verify our results.

</P>
<P>
The benchmarks are usually run with and without the <CODE>--fast</CODE> option.
When run with <CODE>--fast</CODE> we are trying to use every trick the server can
do to get the code to execute as fast as possible.  The idea is that the
normal run should show how the server would work in a default setup and
the <CODE>--fast</CODE> run shows how the server would do if the application
developer would use extensions in the server to make his application run
faster.

</P>
<P>
When running with PostgreSQL and <CODE>--fast</CODE> we do a <CODE>VACUUM</CODE>
after every major table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> to make the
database in perfect shape for the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s.  The time for
<CODE>VACUUM</CODE> is measured separately.

</P>
<P>
When running with PostgreSQL 7.1.1 we could, however, not run with
<CODE>--fast</CODE> because during the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> test, the postmaster (the
PostgreSQL daemon) died and the database was so corrupted that it was
impossible to restart postmaster.   After this happened twice, we decided
to postpone the <CODE>--fast</CODE> test until the next PostgreSQL release.  The
details about the machine we run the benchmark on can be found on the
benchmark page.

</P>
<P>
Before going to the other benchmarks we know of, we would like to give
some background on benchmarks.

</P>
<P>
It's very easy to write a test that shows <STRONG>any</STRONG> database to be the best
database in the world, by just restricting the test to something the
database is very good at and not testing anything that the database is
not good at.  If one, after doing this, summarises the result as
a single figure, things are even easier.

</P>
<P>
This would be like us measuring the speed of MySQL Server compared to PostgreSQL
by looking at the summary time of the MySQL benchmarks on our web page.
Based on this MySQL Server would be more than 40 times faster than PostgreSQL,
something that is, of course, not true.  We could make things even worse
by just taking the test where PostgreSQL performs worst and claim that
MySQL Server is more than 2000 times faster than PostgreSQL.

</P>
<P>
The case is that MySQL does a lot of optimisations that PostgreSQL
doesn't do. This is, of course, also true the other way around.  An SQL
optimiser is a very complex thing, and a company could spend years
just making the optimiser faster and faster.

</P>
<P>
When looking at the benchmark results you should look for things that
you do in your application and just use these results to decide which
database would be best suited for your application.  The benchmark
results also show things a particular database is not good at and should
give you a notion about things to avoid and what you may have to do in
other ways.

</P>
<P>
We know of two benchmark tests that claim that PostgreSQL performs better
than MySQL Server.  These both where multi-user tests, a test that we here at
MySQL AB haven't had time to write and include in the benchmark suite,
mainly because it's a big task to do this in a manner that is fair to
all databases.

</P>
<P>
One is the benchmark paid for by Great Bridge, the company that for 16 months
attempted to build a business based on PostgreSQL but now has ceased
operations. This is probably the worst benchmark we have ever seen anyone
conduct.  This was not only tuned to only test what PostgreSQL is absolutely
best at, but it was also totally unfair to every other database involved in
the test.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>:  We know that even some of the main PostgreSQL
developers did not like the way Great Bridge conducted the benchmark, so we
don't blame the PostgreSQL team for the way the benchmark was done.

</P>
<P>
This benchmark has been condemned in a lot of postings and newsgroups, so
here we will just briefly repeat some things that were wrong with it.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The tests were run with an expensive commercial tool that makes it
impossible for an <CODE>Open Source</CODE> company like us to verify the benchmarks,
or even check how the benchmarks were really done.  The tool is not even
a true benchmark tool, but an application/setup testing tool.  To refer
to this as a ``standard'' benchmark tool is to stretch the truth a long way.

<LI>

Great Bridge admitted that they had optimised the PostgreSQL database
(with <CODE>VACUUM</CODE> before the test) and tuned the startup for the tests,
something they hadn't done for any of the other databases involved.  They
say ``This process optimises indexes and frees up disk space a bit.  The
optimised indexes boost performance by some margin.''  Our benchmarks
clearly indicate that the difference in running a lot of selects on a
database with and without <CODE>VACUUM</CODE> can easily differ by a factor
of 10.

<LI>

The test results were also strange.  The AS3AP test documentation
mentions that the test does ``selections, simple joins, projections,
aggregates, one-tuple updates, and bulk updates.''

PostgreSQL is good at doing <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s and <CODE>JOIN</CODE>s (especially
after a <CODE>VACUUM</CODE>), but doesn't perform as well on <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s or
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>s.  The benchmarks seem to indicate that only <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s
were done (or very few updates).  This could easily explain the good results
for PostgreSQL in this test.  The bad results for MySQL will be obvious a
bit down in this document.

<LI>

They did run the so-called benchmark from a Windows machine against a
Linux machine over ODBC, a setup that no normal database user would ever
do when running a heavy multi-user application.  This tested more the
ODBC driver and the Windows protocol used between the clients than the
database itself.

<LI>

When running the database against Oracle and MS-SQL (Great Bridge has
indirectly indicated the databases they used in the test), they
didn't use the native protocol but instead ODBC.  Anyone that has ever
used Oracle knows that all real applications use the native interface
instead of ODBC.  Doing a test through ODBC and claiming that the results
had anything to do with using the database in a real-world situation can't
be regarded as fair.  They should have done two tests with and without ODBC
to provide the right facts (after having gotten experts to tune all involved
databases, of course).

<LI>

They refer to the TPC-C tests, but they don't mention anywhere that the
test they did was not a true TPC-C test and they were not even allowed to
call it a TPC-C test.  A TPC-C test can only be conducted by the rules
approved by the TPC Council (<a HREF="http://www.tpc.org/">http://www.tpc.org/</a>). Great Bridge
didn't do that.  By doing this they have both violated the TPC trademark
and miscredited their own benchmarks.  The rules set by the TPC Council
are very strict to ensure that no one can produce false results or make
unprovable statements.  Apparently Great Bridge wasn't interested in
doing this.

<LI>

After the first test, we contacted Great Bridge and mentioned to them
some of the obvious mistakes they had done with MySQL Server:


<UL>
<LI>

Running with a debug version of our ODBC driver

<LI>

Running on a Linux system that wasn't optimised for threads

<LI>

Using an old MySQL version when there was a recommended newer one available

<LI>

Not starting MySQL Server with the right options for heavy multi-user use (the
default installation of MySQL Server is tuned for minimal resource use)
</UL>

Great Bridge did run a new test, with our optimised ODBC driver and with
better startup options for MySQL Server, but refused to either use our updated
glibc library or our standard binary (used by 80% of our users), which was
statically linked with a fixed glibc library.

According to what we know, Great Bridge did nothing to ensure that the
other databases were set up correctly to run well in their test
environment.  We are sure, however, that they didn't contact Oracle or
Microsoft to ask for their advice in this matter. ;)

<LI>

The benchmark was paid for by Great Bridge, and they decided to publish
only partial, chosen results (instead of publishing it all).
</UL>

<P>
Tim Perdue, a long-time PostgreSQL fan and a reluctant MySQL user,
published a comparison on PHPbuilder
(<a HREF="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20001112.php3">http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/tim20001112.php3</a>).

</P>
<P>
When we became aware of the comparison, we phoned Tim Perdue about this
because there were a lot of strange things in his results.  For example,
he claimed that MySQL Server had a problem with five users in his tests, when we
know that there are users with similar machines as his that are using
MySQL Server with 2000 simultaneous connections doing 400 queries per second.
(In this case the limit was the web bandwidth, not the database.)

</P>
<P>
It sounded like he was using a Linux kernel that either had some
problems with many threads, such as kernels before 2.4, which had a problem
with many threads on multi-CPU machines. We have documented in this manual
how to fix this and Tim should be aware of this problem.

</P>
<P>
The other possible problem could have been an old glibc library and
that Tim didn't use a MySQL binary from our site, which is linked with
a corrected glibc library, but had compiled a version of his own.
In any of these cases, the symptom would have been exactly what Tim
had measured.

</P>
<P>
We asked Tim if we could get access to his data so that we could repeat
the benchmark and if he could check the MySQL version on the machine to
find out what was wrong and he promised to come back to us about this.
He has not done that yet.

</P>
<P>
Because of this we can't put any trust in this benchmark either. :(

</P>
<P>
Over time things also change and the preceding benchmarks are not that
relevant anymore.  MySQL Server now has a couple of different storage engines
with different speed/concurrency tradeoffs.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>. It
would be interesting to see how the above tests would run with the
different transactional table types in MySQL Server.  PostgreSQL
has, of course,
also got new features since the test was made.  As these tests are
not publicly available there is no way for us to know how the
database would perform in the same tests today.

</P>

<P>
Conclusion:

</P>
<P>
The only benchmarks that exist today that anyone can download and run
against MySQL Server and PostgreSQL are the MySQL benchmarks.
We here at MySQL AB
believe that <CODE>Open Source</CODE> databases should be tested with <CODE>Open Source</CODE> tools!
This is the only way to ensure that no one does tests that nobody can
reproduce and use this to claim that one database is better than another.
Without knowing all the facts it's impossible to answer the claims of the
tester.

</P>
<P>
The thing we find strange is that every test we have seen about
PostgreSQL, that is impossible to reproduce, claims that PostgreSQL is
better in most cases while our tests, which anyone can reproduce,
clearly show otherwise.  With this we don't want to say that PostgreSQL
isn't good at many things (it is!) or that it isn't faster than MySQL Server
under certain conditions.  We would just like to see a fair test where
PostgreSQL performs very well, so that we could get some friendly
competition going!

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
We are working on an even better benchmark suite, including multi-user
tests, and a better documentation of what the individual tests really
do and how to add more tests to the suite.

<UL>
<LI>

For a list of sites from which you can obtain MySQL, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

<LI>

To see which platforms are supported, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>. Please note that
not all supported systems are equally good for running MySQL on them.
On some it is much more robust and efficient than others@-see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>
for details.

<LI>

Several versions of MySQL are available in both binary and
source distributions.  We also provide public access to our current
source tree for those who want to see our most recent developments and
help us test new code.  To determine which version and type of
distribution you should use, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_version">2.2.6  Which MySQL Version to Use</A>. When in doubt,
use the binary distribution.

<LI>

Installation instructions for binary and source distributions are described
in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.10  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>, and section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.  Each set of
instructions includes a section on system-specific problems you may run
into.

<LI>

For post-installation procedures, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>.  These

The recommended way to install MySQL on Linux is by using the RPM
packages. The MySQL RPMs are currently being built on a SuSE Linux 7.3
system but should work on most versions of Linux that support <CODE>rpm</CODE>
and use <CODE>glibc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with an RPM file, for example, if you receive the error
``<CODE>Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up</CODE>''@-see

The RPM files you may want to use are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The MySQL server.  You will need this unless you only want to
connect to a MySQL server running on another machine. Please note
that this package was called <CODE>MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE> before
MySQL 4.0.10.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to
install this package.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-bench-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

Tests and benchmarks. Requires Perl and msql-mysql-modules RPMs.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-devel-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

Libraries and include files needed if you want to compile other
MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-shared-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

This package contains the shared libraries (<CODE>libmysqlclient.so*</CODE>)
which certain languages and applications need to dynamically load and
use MySQL.

<LI><CODE>MySQL-embedded-VERSION.i386.rpm</CODE>

The embedded MySQL server library (MySQL 4.x and onwards only).

<LI><CODE>MySQL-VERSION.src.rpm</CODE>

This contains the source code for all of the previous packages. It can also
be used to rebuild the RPMs on other architectures (for example, Alpha or SPARC).
</UL>

<P>
To see all files in an RPM package, run:

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -qpl MySQL-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To perform a standard minimal installation, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-server-VERSION.i386.rpm MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
To install just the client package, run:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm -i MySQL-client-VERSION.i386.rpm
</PRE>

<P>
The RPM places data in <TT>`/var/lib/mysql'</TT>. The RPM also creates the
appropriate entries in <TT>`/etc/init.d/'</TT> to start the server automatically
at boot time. (This means that if you have performed a previous
installation, you may want to make a copy of your previously installed
MySQL startup file if you made any changes to it, so you don't lose
your changes.)

</P>
<P>
If you want to install the MySQL RPM on older Linux distributions that do
not support init scripts in <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> (directly or via a symlink),
you should create a symbolic link pointing to the old location before
installing the RPM:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /etc ; ln -s rc.d/init.d .
</PRE>

<P>
However, all current major Linux distributions should already support this
new directory layout as it is required for LSB (Linux Standard Base)
compliance.

</P>
<P>
After installing the RPM file(s), the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon should be up and
running and you should now be able to start using MySQL.

as a service. See section <A HREF="manual.html#NT_start">2.6.2.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000 or XP</A>.

If you want to use tables bigger than 4G, you should install MySQL
on an NTFS or newer filesystem. Don't forget to use <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> and
<CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> when you create the table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

TCP/IP protocol support.

feature to avoid corruption of files during the download process.
<LI>

A <CODE>ZIP</CODE> program to unpack the distribution file.
<LI>

Enough space on the hard drive to unpack, install, and create the

directory is typically something like <TT>`C:\WINDOWS'</TT> or <TT>`C:\WINNT'</TT>.
You can determine its exact location from the value of the <CODE>windir</CODE>
environment variable.)  MySQL looks first for the <CODE>my.ini</CODE> file,
then for the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
If your PC uses a boot loader where the C drive isn't the boot drive,
your only option is to use the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file.  Also note that
if you use the <CODE>WinMySQLAdmin</CODE> tool, it uses only the <TT>`my.ini'</TT>
file.  The <TT>`\mysql\bin'</TT> directory contains a help file with
instructions for using this tool.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>notepad.exe</CODE>, create the option file and edit the
<CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section to specify values for the <CODE>basedir</CODE> and
<CODE>datadir</CODE> parameters:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
# set basedir to installation path, e.g., c:/mysql
basedir=the_install_path
# set datadir to location of data directory,
# e.g., c:/mysql/data or d:/mydata/data
datadir=the_data_path
</PRE>

<P>
Note that Windows pathnames should be specified in option files using
forward slashes rather than backslashes.  If you do use backslashes, you
must double them.

</P>
<P>
If you would like to use a data directory different from the default of
<TT>`c:\mysql\data'</TT>, you must copy the entire contents of the
<TT>`c:\mysql\data'</TT> directory to the new location.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> transactional tables, you
need to manually create two new directories to hold the InnoDB
data and log files@-e.g., <TT>`c:\ibdata'</TT> and <TT>`c:\iblogs'</TT>.
You will also need to add some extra lines to the option
file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.2  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, add the
<CODE>skip-innodb</CODE> option to the option file.

</P>
<P>
Now you are ready to test starting the server.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Windows_server_first_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows_server_first_start">2.1.2.3  Starting the Server for the First Time</A></H4>

<P>
Testing from a DOS command prompt is the best thing to do because
the server displays status messages that appear in the DOS window.
If something is wrong with your configuration, these messages will
make it easier for you to identify and fix any problems.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you are in the directory where the server is located, then
enter this command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqld-max --standalone

<P>
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.11, you can install MySQL on Mac OS X 10.2
("Jaguar") using a Mac OS X <CODE>PKG</CODE> binary package instead of the
binary tarball distribution. Please note that older versions of Mac OS X
(e.g. 10.1.x) are not supported by this package!

</P>
<P>
The package is located inside a disk image (<CODE>.dmg</CODE>) file, that you
first need to mount by double-clicking its icon in the Finder. It should
then mount the image and display its contents.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure
that no other MySQL server is running!

</P>
<P>
Please shut down all running MySQL instances before continuing by either
using the MySQL Manager Application (on Mac OS X Server) or via
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> on the command line.

</P>
<P>
To actually install the MySQL PKG, double click on the package icon. This
will launch the Mac OS Package Installer, which will guide you through
the installation of MySQL.

</P>
<P>
The Mac OS X PKG of MySQL will install itself into
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql-&#60;version&#62;'</TT> and will also install a symbolic link
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>, pointing to the new location. If a directory named
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> already exists, it will be renamed to
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql.bak'</TT> first. Additionally, it will install the mysql
grant tables by executing <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> after the installation.

</P>
<P>
The installation layout is similar to the one of the binary distribution,
all MySQL binaries are located in directory <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/bin'</TT>.
The MySQL socket will be put into <TT>`/etc/mysql.sock'</TT> by default.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installation_layouts">2.2.7  Installation Layouts</A>.

</P>
<P>
It requires a user account named <CODE>mysql</CODE> (which should exist by default
on Mac OS X 10.2 and up).

</P>
<P>
If you are running Mac OS X Server, you already have a version of MySQL
installed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mac OS X Server 10.2-10.2.2 come with MySQL 3.23.51 installed
<LI>

Mac OS X Server 10.2.3 and 10.2.4 ship with MySQL 3.23.53
</UL>

<P>
This manual section covers the installation of the official MySQL Mac OS X
PKG only.  Make sure to read Apple's help about installing MySQL (Run the
"Help View" application, select "Mac OS X Server" help, and do a search for
"MySQL" and read the item entitled "Installing MySQL").

</P>
<P>
Especially note, that the pre-installed version of MySQL on Mac OS X Server
is being started with the command <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> instead of
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>!

</P>
<P>
If you previously used Marc Liyanage's MySQL packages for Mac OS X from
<a HREF="http://www.entropy.ch">http://www.entropy.ch</a>, you can simply follow the update instructions
for packages using the binary installation layout as given on his pages.

</P>
<P>
If you are upgrading from Marc's version or from the Mac OS X Server version
of MySQL to the official MySQL PKG, you also need to convert the existing
MySQL privilege tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.23">2.5.2  Upgrading From Version 3.23 to Version 4.0</A>.

</P>
<P>
After the installation, you can start up MySQL by running the following
commands in a terminal window. Please note that you need to have
administrator privileges to perform this task!

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
(Enter your password)
(Press CTRL+Z)
shell&#62; bg
(Press CTRL+D to exit the shell)
</PRE>

<P>
You should now be able to connect to the MySQL server, e.g. by running
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
To enable the automatic startup of MySQL on bootup, you can download
Marc Liyanage's MySQL StartupItem from the following location:

</P>
<P>
<a HREF="http://www2.entropy.ch/download/mysql-startupitem.pkg.tar.gz">http://www2.entropy.ch/download/mysql-startupitem.pkg.tar.gz</a>

</P>
<P>
We plan to add a StartupItem to the official MySQL PKG in the near future.

</P>
<P>
Please note that installing a new MySQL PKG does not remove the directory
of an older installation - unfortunately the Mac OS X Installer does not yet
offer the functionality required to properly upgrade previously installed
packages. After you have copied over the MySQL database files from the
previous version and have successfully started the new version, you should
consider removing the old installation files to save up disk space.
Additionally, you should also remove older versions of the Package Receipt
directories located in <TT>`/Library/Receipts/mysql-&#60;version&#62;.pkg'</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="Verifying_Package_Integrity" HREF="manual_toc.html#Verifying_Package_Integrity">2.2.2  Verifying Package Integrity Using <CODE>MD5 Checksums</CODE> or <CODE>GnuPG</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
After you have downloaded the MySQL package that suits your needs and before
you attempt to install it, you should make sure it is intact and has not
been tampered with.

</P>
<P>
MySQL AB offers two means of integrity checking: <CODE>MD5 checksums</CODE> and
cryptographic signatures using <CODE>GnuPG</CODE>, the <CODE>GNU Privacy Guard</CODE>.

</P>

<H3>2.2.3  Verifying the <CODE>MD5 Checksum</CODE></H3>

<P>
After you have downloaded the package, you should check, if the MD5 checksum
matches the one provided on the MySQL download pages. Each package has an
individual checksum, that you can verify with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; md5sum &#60;package&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Note, that not all operating systems support the <CODE>md5sum</CODE> command - on
some it is simply called <CODE>md5</CODE>, others do not ship it at all. On Linux,
it is part of the <CODE>GNU Text Utilities</CODE> package, which is available for
a wide range of platforms. You can download the source code from
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/">http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/</a> as well. If you have
<CODE>OpenSSL</CODE> installed, you can also use the command <CODE>openssl md5
&#60;package&#62;</CODE> instead. A DOS/Windows implementation of the <CODE>md5</CODE> command
is available from <a HREF="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/</a>.

</P>
<P>
Example:

<PRE>
shell&#62; md5sum mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
155836a7ed8c93aee6728a827a6aa153
                mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
You should check, if the resulting checksum matches the one printed on
the download page right below the respective package.

</P>
<P>
Most mirror sites also offer a file named <TT>`MD5SUMS'</TT>, which also includes
the MD5 checksums for all files included in the <TT>`Downloads'</TT> directory.
Please note however that it's very easy to modify this file and it's not a
very reliable method! If in doubt, you should consult different mirror sites
and compare the results.

</P>

<H3>2.2.4  Signature Checking Using <CODE>GnuPG</CODE></H3>

<P>
A more reliable method of verifying the integrity of a package is using
cryptographic signatures. MySQL AB uses the <CODE>GNU Privacy Guard</CODE>
(<CODE>GnuPG</CODE>), an <CODE>Open Source</CODE> alternative to the very well-known
<CODE>Pretty Good Privacy</CODE> (<CODE>PGP</CODE>) by Phil Zimmermann.
See <a HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/">http://www.gnupg.org/</a> and <a HREF="http://www.openpgp.org/">http://www.openpgp.org/</a>
for more information about <CODE>OpenPGP</CODE>/<CODE>GnuPG</CODE> and how to obtain
and install <CODE>GnuPG</CODE> on your system. Most Linux distributions already
ship with <CODE>GnuPG</CODE> installed by default.

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 (February 2003), MySQL AB has started signing
their downloadable packages with <CODE>GnuPG</CODE>. Cryptographic signatures are
a much more reliable method of verifying the integrity and authenticity of
a file.

</P>
<P>
To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to obtain a
copy of MySQL AB's public GPG build key <a HREF="mailto:build@mysql.com">build@mysql.com</a>. You can
either cut and paste it directly from here, or obtain it from
<a HREF="http://www.keyserver.net/">http://www.keyserver.net/</a>.

<P>
You can import this key into your public <CODE>GPG</CODE> keyring by using
<CODE>gpg --import</CODE>. See the <CODE>GPG</CODE> documentation for more info
on how to work with public keys.

</P>
<P>
After you have downloaded and imported the public build key,
now download your desired MySQL package and the corresponding
signature, which is also available from the download page.
The signature has the file name extension <TT>`.asc'</TT>. For example,
the signature for <TT>`mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz'</TT>
would be <TT>`mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc'</TT>.
Make sure that both files are stored in the same directory and then run
the following command to verify the signature for this file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gpg --verify &#60;package&#62;.asc

Example:

shell&#62; gpg --verify mysql-standard-4.0.10-gamma-pc-linux-i686.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!

<P>
The "Good signature" message indicates that everything is all right.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>RPM</CODE> packages, there is no separate signature - <CODE>RPM</CODE> packages
actually have a built-in <CODE>GPG</CODE> signature and <CODE>MD5 checksum</CODE>. You can
verify them by running the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm --checksig &#60;package&#62;.rpm

Example:

shell&#62; rpm --checksig MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm
MySQL-server-4.0.10-0.i386.rpm: md5 gpg OK

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If you are using RPM 4.1 and it complains about <CODE>(GPG)
NOT OK (MISSING KEYS: GPG#5072e1f5)</CODE> (even though you have imported it into
your GPG public keyring), you need to import the key into the RPM keyring
first. RPM 4.1 does not use your GPG keyring (and GPG itself) anymore, but
rather maintains its own keyring (because it's a system wide application and
the GPG public keyring is user-specific file). To import the MySQL public
key into the RPM keyring, please use the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rpm --import &#60;pubkey&#62;

Example:

<P>
In case you notice that the <CODE>MD5 checksum</CODE> or <CODE>GPG</CODE> signatures
do not match, first try to download the respective package one more time,

Note that not all platforms are suited equally well for running
MySQL. How well a certain platform is suited for a high-load
mission-critical MySQL server is determined by the following
factors:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

General stability of the thread library. A platform may have excellent
reputation otherwise, but if the thread library is unstable in the code
that is called by MySQL, even if everything else is perfect, MySQL will
be only as stable as the thread library.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or thread library to take advantage of
<STRONG>SMP</STRONG> on multi-processor systems. In other words, when a process
creates a thread, it should be possible for that thread to run on a different
CPU than the original process.

<LI>

The ability of the kernel and/or the thread library to run many threads which
acquire/release a mutex over a short critical region frequently without
excessive context switches. In other words, if the implementation of
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> is too anxious to yield CPU time, this will hurt
MySQL tremendously. If this issue is not taken care of, adding extra CPUs
will actually make MySQL slower.

<LI>

General filesystem stability/performance.

<LI>

Ability of the filesystem to deal with large files at all and deal with them
efficiently, if your tables are big.

<LI>

Our level of expertise here at MySQL AB with the platform. If we know
a platform well, we introduce platform-specific optimisations/fixes enabled at
compile time. We can also provide advice on configuring your system optimally
for MySQL.

<LI>

The amount of testing of similar configurations we have done internally.

<LI>

The number of users that have successfully run MySQL on that
platform in similar configurations. If this number is high, the chances of
hitting some platform-specific surprises are much smaller.
</UL>

<P>
Based on the preceding criteria, the best platforms for running
MySQL at this point are x86 with SuSE Linux 7.1, 2.4 kernel, and
ReiserFS (or any similar Linux distribution) and SPARC with Solaris 2.7
or 2.8. FreeBSD comes third, but we really hope it will join the top
club once the thread library is improved. We also hope that at some
point we will be able to include all other platforms on which
MySQL compiles, runs okay, but not quite with the same level of
stability and performance, into the top category. This will require some
effort on our part in cooperation with the developers of the OS/library
components MySQL depends upon. If you are interested in making
one of those components better, are in a position to influence their
development, and need more detailed instructions on what MySQL
needs to run better, send an e-mail to
<a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>.

</P>
<P>
Please note that the preceding comparison is not to say that one OS is better or
worse than the other in general. We are talking about choosing a particular OS
for a dedicated purpose@-running MySQL, and compare platforms in that
regard only. With this in mind, the result of this comparison
would be different if we included more issues into it. And in some cases,
the reason one OS is better than the other could simply be that we have put
forth more effort into testing on and optimising for that particular platform.
We are just stating our observations to help you decide on which
platform to use MySQL on in your setup.

The first decision to make is whether you want to use the latest development
release or the last stable release:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Normally, if you are beginning to use MySQL for the first time or trying
to port it to some system for which there is no binary distribution, we
recommend going with the stable release (currently version 3.23).  Note
that all MySQL releases are checked with the MySQL benchmarks and an
extensive test suite before each release (even the development
releases).

<LI>

Otherwise, if you are running an old system and want to upgrade, but
don't want to take chances with a non-seamless upgrade, you should
upgrade to the latest in the same branch you are using (where only the
last version number is newer than yours).  We have tried to fix only
fatal bugs and make small, relatively safe changes to that version.
</UL>

<P>
The second decision to make is whether you want to use a source
distribution or a binary distribution.  In most cases you should probably
use a binary distribution, if one exists for your platform, as this
generally will be easier to install than a source distribution.

</P>
<P>
In the following cases you probably will be better off with a source
installation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to install MySQL at some explicit location.  (The standard
binary distributions are ``ready to run'' at any place, but you may want
to get even more flexibility).

<LI>

To be able to satisfy different user requirements, we are providing two
different binary versions: one compiled with the non-transactional storage
engines (a small, fast binary), and one configured with the most
important extended options like transaction-safe tables.  Both versions
are compiled from the same source distribution.  All native <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
clients can connect to both MySQL versions.

The extended MySQL binary distribution is marked with the
<CODE>-max</CODE> suffix and is configured with the same options as
<CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

If you want to use the MySQL-Max RPM, you must first
install the standard MySQL RPM.

<LI>

If you want to configure <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with some extra features that are
not in the standard binary distributions.  Here is a list of the most
common extra options that you may want to use:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>--with-innodb</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-berkeley-db</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-raid</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-libwrap</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-named-z-lib  (This is done for some of the binaries)</CODE>

<LI><CODE>--with-debug[=full]</CODE>

</UL>

<LI>

The default binary distribution is normally compiled with support
for all character sets and should work on a variety of processors from
the same processor family.

If you want a faster MySQL server you may want to recompile it
with support for only the character sets you need, use a better compiler
(like <CODE>pgcc</CODE>), or use compiler options that are better optimised for your
processor.

<LI>

If you have found a bug and reported it to the MySQL
development team you will probably receive a patch that you need to apply to
the source distribution to get the bug fixed.

<LI>

If you want to read (and/or modify) the C and C++ code that makes up
MySQL, you should get a source distribution.  The source code is
always the ultimate manual.  Source distributions also contain more
tests and examples than binary distributions.
</UL>

<P>
The MySQL naming scheme uses release numbers that consist of three
numbers and a suffix.  For example, a release name like
<CODE>mysql-3.21.17-beta</CODE> is interpreted like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first number (<CODE>3</CODE>) describes the file format.  All Version 3
releases have the same file format.

<LI>

The second number (<CODE>21</CODE>) is the release level.  Normally there are two to
choose from. One is the release/stable branch (currently <CODE>23</CODE>) and the
other is the development branch (currently <CODE>4.0</CODE>).  Normally both are
stable, but the development version may have quirks, may be missing documentation on
new features, or may fail to compile on some systems.

<LI>

The third number (<CODE>17</CODE>) is the version number within the
release level.  This is incremented for each new distribution.  Usually you
want the latest version for the release level you have chosen.

<LI>

The suffix (<CODE>beta</CODE>) indicates the stability level of the release.
The possible suffixes are:


<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>alpha</CODE> indicates that the release contains some large section of
new code that hasn't been 100% tested.  Known bugs (usually there are none)
should be documented in the News section.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.  There are also new
commands and extensions in most alpha releases.  Active development that
may involve major code changes can occur on an alpha release, but everything
will be tested before doing a release.  There should be no known bugs in any
MySQL release.

<LI>

<CODE>beta</CODE> means that all new code has been tested.  No major new
features that could cause corruption on old code are added.  There should
be no known bugs.  A version changes from alpha to beta when there
haven't been any reported fatal bugs within an alpha version for at least
a month and we don't plan to add any features that could make any old command
more unreliable.

<LI>

<CODE>gamma</CODE> is a beta that has been around a while and seems to work fine.
Only minor fixes are added.  This is what many other companies call a release.

<LI>

If there is no suffix, it means that the version has been run for a
while at many different sites with no reports of bugs other than
platform-specific bugs.  Only critical bug fixes are applied to the
release. This is what we call a stable release.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
All versions of MySQL are run through our standard tests and
benchmarks to ensure that they are relatively safe to use.  Because the
standard tests are extended over time to check for all previously found bugs,
the test suite keeps getting better.

This section describes the default layout of the directories created by
installing binary and source distributions.

</P>
<P>
A binary distribution is installed by unpacking it at the installation
location you choose (typically <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>) and creates the
following directories in that location:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Directory</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Contents of directory</STRONG>

A source distribution is installed after you configure and compile it.  By
default, the installation step installs files under <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>, in the

</TABLE>

<P>
Within an installation directory, the layout of a source installation differs
from that of a binary installation in the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is installed in the <TT>`libexec'</TT>
directory rather than in the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory.

<LI>

The data directory is <TT>`var'</TT> rather than <TT>`data'</TT>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is installed in the <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT> directory
rather than in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/scripts'</TT>.

<LI>

The header file and library directories are <TT>`include/mysql'</TT> and
<TT>`lib/mysql'</TT> rather than <TT>`include'</TT> and <TT>`lib'</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
You can create your own binary installation from a compiled source
distribution by executing the script <TT>`scripts/make_binary_distribution'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL is evolving quite rapidly here at MySQL AB and we
want to share this with other MySQL users.  We try to make a release
when we have very useful features that others seem to have a need for.

</P>
<P>
We also try to help out users who request features that are easy to
implement.  We take note of what our licensed users want to have, and
we especially take note of what our extended e-mail supported customers
want and try to help them out.

</P>
<P>
No one has to download a new release.  The News section will tell you if
the new release has something you really want.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#News">D  MySQL Change History</A>.

</P>
<P>
We use the following policy when updating MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For each minor update, the last number in the version string is incremented.
When there are major new features or minor incompatibilities with previous
versions, the second number in the version string is incremented.  When the
file format changes, the first number is increased.

<LI>

Stable-tested releases are meant to appear about 1-2 times a year, but
if small bugs are found, a release with only bug fixes will be released.

<LI>

Working releases/bug fixes to old releases are meant to appear about
every 1-8 weeks.

<LI>

Binary distributions for some platforms will be made by us for major releases.
Other people may make binary distributions for other systems but probably
less frequently.

<LI>

We usually make patches available as soon as we have located and fixed
small bugs. They are posted to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> and will
be added to the next release.

<LI>

For non-critical but annoying bugs, we will add them the MySQL source
repository and they will be fixed in the next release.

<LI>

If there is, by any chance, a fatal bug in a release we will make a new
release as soon as possible.  We would like other companies to do this,
too.
</UL>

<P>
The current stable release is Version 3.23; we have already moved active
development to Version 4.0.  Bugs will still be fixed in the stable version.
We don't believe in a complete freeze, as this also leaves out bug fixes
and things that ``must be done.''  ``Somewhat frozen'' means that we may
add small things that ``almost surely will not affect anything that's
already working.''

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses a slightly different naming scheme from most other products.
In general it's relatively safe to use any version that has been out for
a couple of weeks without being replaced with a new version.

</P>
<P>
To install a binary distribution, follow these steps, then proceed
to section <A HREF="manual.html#Post-installation">2.4  Post-installation Setup and Testing</A>, for post-installation setup and testing:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the distribution, and move
into it.  In the following example, we unpack the distribution under
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT> and create a directory <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> into which
MySQL is installed.  (The following instructions, therefore, assume
you have permission to create files in <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.  If that directory
is protected, you will need to perform the installation as <CODE>root</CODE>.)

<LI>

Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_MySQL">2.2.1  How to Get MySQL</A>.

MySQL binary distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE>
archives and have names like <TT>`mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz'</TT>, where
<CODE>VERSION</CODE> is a number (for example, <CODE>3.21.15</CODE>), and <CODE>OS</CODE>
indicates the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
(for example, <CODE>pc-linux-gnu-i586</CODE>).

<LI>

If you see a binary distribution marked with the <CODE>-max</CODE> suffix, this
means that the binary has support for transaction-safe tables and other
features. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.  Note that all binaries
are built from the same MySQL source distribution.

<LI>

Add a user and group for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; groupadd mysql
shell&#62; useradd -g mysql mysql
</PRE>

These commands add the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user.  The
syntax for <CODE>useradd</CODE> and <CODE>groupadd</CODE> may differ slightly on different
versions of Unix.  They may also be called <CODE>adduser</CODE> and <CODE>addgroup</CODE>.
You may wish to call the user and group something else instead of <CODE>mysql</CODE>.

<LI>

Change into the intended installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /usr/local
</PRE>

<LI>

Unpack the distribution and create the installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
shell&#62; ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql
</PRE>

The first command creates a directory named <TT>`mysql-VERSION-OS'</TT>.  The
second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This lets you refer
more easily to the installation directory as <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the installation directory:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql
</PRE>

You will find several files and subdirectories in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> directory.
The most important for installation purposes are the <TT>`bin'</TT> and
<TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectories.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`bin'</TT>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
This directory contains client programs and the server
You should add the full pathname of this directory to your
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL
programs properly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

<DT><TT>`scripts'</TT>
<DD>
This directory contains the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script used to initialise
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database containing the grant tables that store the server
access permissions.
</DL>

<LI>

If you would like to use <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> and have the MySQL
distribution in some non-standard place, you must change the location where
<CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> expects to find the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  Edit the
<TT>`bin/mysqlaccess'</TT> script at approximately line 18.  Search for a line
that looks like this:


<PRE>
$MYSQL     = '/usr/local/bin/mysql';    # path to mysql executable
</PRE>

Change the path to reflect the location where <CODE>mysql</CODE> actually is
stored on your system.  If you do not do this, you will get a <CODE>Broken
pipe</CODE> error when you run <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.

<LI>

Create the MySQL grant tables (necessary only if you haven't
installed MySQL before):

<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Note that MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10 started the
MySQL server when you run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  This is no
longer true!

<LI>

Change ownership of binaries to <CODE>root</CODE> and ownership of the data
directory to the user that you will run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as:


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R root  /usr/local/mysql/.
shell&#62; chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/data
shell&#62; chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/.
</PRE>

The first command changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the files to the
<CODE>root</CODE> user, the second one changes the <CODE>owner</CODE> attribute of the
data directory to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> user, and the third one changes the
<CODE>group</CODE> attribute to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> group.

<LI>

If you want to install support for the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_support">2.7  Perl Installation Comments</A>.

<LI>

If you would like MySQL to start automatically when you boot your
machine, you can copy <CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> to the location where
your system has its startup files.  More information can be found in the
<CODE>support-files/mysql.server</CODE> script itself and in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

You need the following tools to build and install MySQL from source:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>gunzip</CODE> to uncompress the distribution.

<LI>

A reasonable <CODE>tar</CODE> to unpack the distribution.  GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> is
known to work.  Sun <CODE>tar</CODE> is known to have problems.

<LI>

A working ANSI C++ compiler.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2, <CODE>egcs</CODE> &#62;= 1.0.2
or <CODE>egcs 2.91.66</CODE>, SGI C++, and SunPro C++ are some of the
compilers that are known to work.  <CODE>libg++</CODE> is not needed when
using <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x has a bug that makes it impossible
to compile some perfectly legal C++ files, such as
<TT>`sql/sql_base.cc'</TT>.  If you only have <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.7.x, you must
upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> to be able to compile MySQL. <CODE>gcc</CODE>
2.8.1 is also known to have problems on some platforms, so it should be
avoided if a new compiler exists for the platform.

<CODE>gcc</CODE> &#62;= 2.95.2 is recommended when compiling MySQL
Version 3.23.x.

<LI>

A good <CODE>make</CODE> program.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> is always recommended and is
sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> 3.75 or newer.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using a recent version of <CODE>gcc</CODE>, recent enough to understand the
<CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> option, it is <STRONG>very important</STRONG> that you use
it. Otherwise, you may compile a binary that crashes randomly. We also
recommend that you use <CODE>-felide-constructors</CODE> and <CODE>-fno-rtti</CODE> along
with <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE>. When in doubt, do the following:

</P>

<PRE>

CFLAGS="-O3" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
       -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
       --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static

<LI>

To compile just the MySQL client libraries and client programs and
not the server, use the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --without-server
</PRE>

If you don't have a C++ compiler, <CODE>mysql</CODE> will not compile (it is the
one client program that requires C++).  In this case,
you can remove the code in <CODE>configure</CODE> that tests for the C++ compiler
and then run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--without-server</CODE> option. The
compile step will still try to build <CODE>mysql</CODE>, but you can ignore any
warnings about <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT>.  (If <CODE>make</CODE> stops, try <CODE>make -k</CODE>
to tell it to continue with the rest of the build even if errors occur.)

<LI>

If you want to get an embedded MySQL library (<CODE>libmysqld.a</CODE>) you should
use the <CODE>--with-embedded-server</CODE> option.

<LI>

If you don't want your log files and database directories located under
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>, use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command, something like one
of these:

shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
           --localstatedir=/usr/local/mysql/data
</PRE>

The first command changes the installation prefix so that everything is
installed under <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> rather than the default of
<TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.  The second command preserves the default installation
prefix, but overrides the default location for database directories
(normally <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>) and changes it to
<CODE>/usr/local/mysql/data</CODE>.  After you have compiled MySQL, you can
change these options with option files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

If you are using Unix and you want the MySQL socket located somewhere

<TT>`/var/run'</TT>) use a <CODE>configure</CODE> command like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-unix-socket-path=/usr/local/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock
</PRE>

Note that the given file must be an absolute pathname!
You can also later change the location <TT>`mysql.sock'</TT> by using the MySQL
option files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

If you want to compile statically linked programs (for example, to make a
binary distribution, to get more speed, or to work around problems with some
RedHat Linux distributions), run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:


<PRE>

If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and don't have <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
installed, you can tell <CODE>configure</CODE> to use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++
compiler:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure
</PRE>

When you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as your C++ compiler, it will not attempt to link in
<CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  This may be a good idea to do even if you
have the above libraries installed, as some versions of these libraries have
caused strange problems for MySQL users in the past.

Here are some common environment variables to set depending on
the compiler you are using:

<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

In most cases you can get a reasonably optimal MySQL binary by
using the options from the preceding table and adding the following options to the
configure line:


<PRE>
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

The full configure line would, in other words, be something like the
following for all recent gcc versions:


<PRE>
CFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mpentiumpro \
-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler \
--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

The binaries we provide on the MySQL web site at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a> are all compiled with full optimisation and
should be perfect for most users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.9  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>.  There are some
things you can tweak to make an even faster binary, but this is only for
advanced users.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compile_and_link_options">5.5.3  How Compiling and Linking Affects the Speed of MySQL</A>.

If the build fails and produces errors about your compiler or linker not
being able to create the shared library <TT>`libmysqlclient.so.#'</TT> (<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
is a version number), you can work around this problem by giving the
<CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>configure</CODE> will not build a shared <TT>`libmysqlclient.so.#'</TT> library.

<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<LI>

You can configure MySQL not to use <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> column values for
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> columns (that is, columns that are not allowed to be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>).  This causes <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to generate an error
unless you explicitly specify values for all columns that require a
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  To suppress use of default values, run
<CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXXFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS ./configure

By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set. To
change the default set, use the <CODE>--with-charset</CODE> option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-charset=CHARSET
</PRE>

<CODE>CHARSET</CODE> may be one of <CODE>big5</CODE>, <CODE>cp1251</CODE>, <CODE>cp1257</CODE>,
<CODE>czech</CODE>, <CODE>danish</CODE>, <CODE>dec8</CODE>, <CODE>dos</CODE>, <CODE>euc_kr</CODE>,

<CODE>usa7</CODE>, or <CODE>win1251ukr</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

If you want to convert characters between the server and the client,
you should take a look at the <CODE>SET CHARACTER SET</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: If you change character sets after having created any
tables, you will have to run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q --set-character-set=charset</CODE>
on every table. Your
indexes may be sorted incorrectly otherwise.  (This can happen if you
install MySQL, create some tables, then reconfigure
MySQL to use a different character set and reinstall it.)

With the option <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=LIST</CODE> you can define
which additional character sets should be compiled into the server.

Here <CODE>LIST</CODE> is either a list of character
sets separated with spaces,
<CODE>complex</CODE> to include all characters that can't be dynamically loaded,
or <CODE>all</CODE> to include all character sets into the binaries.

<LI>

To configure MySQL with debugging code, use the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>
option:

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-debug
</PRE>

This causes a safe memory allocator to be included that can find some errors
and that provides output about what is happening.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

If your client programs are using threads, you need to also compile a
thread-safe version of the MySQL client library with the
<CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> configure options. This will create a
<CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE> library with which you should link your threaded
applications.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.8  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.

<STRONG>Caution</STRONG>: You should read this section only if you are interested
in helping us test our new code. If you just want to get MySQL up
and running on your system, you should use a standard release distribution
(either a source or binary distribution will do).

</P>
<P>
To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these instructions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Download <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> from
<a HREF="http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi">http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi</a>.  You will need
<CODE>Bitkeeper</CODE> 3.0 or newer to access our repository.

<LI>

Follow the instructions to install it.

<LI>

After <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> is installed, first go to the directory you
want to work from, and then use one of the following commands to clone
the MySQL version branch of your choice:

To clone the 3.23 branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-3.23 mysql-3.23
</PRE>

To clone the 4.0 branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.0 mysql-4.0
</PRE>

To clone the 4.1 branch, use this command:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone bk://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
</PRE>

In the preceding examples the source tree will be set up in the
<TT>`mysql-3.23/'</TT>, <TT>`mysql-4.0/'</TT>, or <TT>`mysql-4.1/'</TT>
subdirectory of your current directory.

If you are behind a firewall and can only initiate HTTP connections,
you can also use <CODE>BitKeeper</CODE> via HTTP.

If you are required to use a proxy server, simply set the environment
variable <CODE>http_proxy</CODE> to point to your proxy:


<PRE>
shell&#62; export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/"
</PRE>

Now, simply replace the <CODE>bk://</CODE> with <CODE>http://</CODE> when doing
a clone. Example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; bk clone http://mysql.bkbits.net/mysql-4.1 mysql-4.1
</PRE>

The initial download of the source tree may take a while, depending on the
speed of your connection - please be patient.

<LI>

You will need GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, <CODE>autoconf 2.53 (or newer)</CODE>,
<CODE>automake 1.5</CODE>, <CODE>libtool 1.4</CODE>, and <CODE>m4</CODE> to run the next
set of commands.  Note that <CODE>automake 1.7 or newer</CODE> doesn't yet work.

If you are using trying to configure MySQL 4.1 you will also need
<CODE>bison 1.75</CODE>.  Older versions of <CODE>bison</CODE> may report this error:
<CODE>sql_yacc.yy:#####: fatal error: maximum table size (32767)
exceeded</CODE>. Note: the maximum table size is not actually exceeded,
the error is caused by bugs in these earlier <CODE>bison</CODE> versions.

The typical command to do in a shell is:


<PRE>
cd mysql-4.0
bk -r get -Sq
aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake
(cd innobase ; aclocal; autoheader; autoconf; automake) # for InnoDB
(cd bdb/dist ; sh s_all ) # for Berkeley DB
./configure  # Add your favorite options here
make
</PRE>

If you get some strange error during this stage, check that you really
have <CODE>libtool</CODE> installed!

A collection of our standard configure scripts is located in the
<TT>`BUILD/'</TT> subdirectory.  If you are lazy, you can use
<TT>`BUILD/compile-pentium-debug'</TT>. To compile on a different architecture,
modify the script by removing flags that are Pentium-specific.

<LI>

When the build is done, run <CODE>make install</CODE>.  Be careful with this
on a production machine; the command may overwrite your live release
installation.  If you have another installation of MySQL, we
recommand that you run <CODE>./configure</CODE> with different values for the
<CODE>prefix</CODE>, <CODE>with-tcp-port</CODE>, and <CODE>unix-socket-path</CODE> options than
those used for your production server.

<LI>

Play hard with your new installation and try to make the new features
crash.  Start by running <CODE>make test</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">9.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.

<LI>

If you have gotten to the <CODE>make</CODE> stage and the distribution does
not compile, please report it to <a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>.  If you
have installed the latest versions of the required GNU tools, and they
crash trying to process our configuration files, please report that also.
However, if you execute <CODE>aclocal</CODE> and get a <CODE>command not found</CODE>
error or a similar problem, do not report it.  Instead, make sure all
the necessary tools are installed and that your <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable is
set correctly so that your shell can find them.

<LI>

After the initial <CODE>bk clone</CODE> operation to get the source tree, you
should run <CODE>bk pull</CODE> periodically to get the updates.

<LI>

You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs by using
<CODE>bk sccstool</CODE>.  If you see some funny diffs or code that you have a

If <CODE>configure</CODE> is run after it already has been run, it may use
information that was gathered during its previous invocation.  This

up, it looks for that file and reads its contents if it exists, on the
assumption that the information is still correct.  That assumption is invalid
when you reconfigure.

<LI>

Each time you run <CODE>configure</CODE>, you must run <CODE>make</CODE> again
to recompile.  However, you may want to remove old object files from previous
builds first because they were compiled using different configuration options.

If you get errors when compiling <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, such as the ones shown
here, you have probably run out of memory or swap space:


<PRE>
Internal compiler error: program cc1plus got fatal signal 11
  or
Out of virtual memory
  or
Virtual memory exhausted
</PRE>

The problem is that <CODE>gcc</CODE> requires huge amounts of memory to compile
<TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with inline functions.  Try running <CODE>configure</CODE> with
the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --with-low-memory
</PRE>

This option causes <CODE>-fno-inline</CODE> to be added to the compile line if you
are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> and <CODE>-O0</CODE> if you are using something else.  You
should try the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option even if you have so much
memory and swap space that you think you can't possibly have run out.  This
problem has been observed to occur even on systems with generous hardware
configurations, and the <CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> option usually fixes it.

<LI>

By default, <CODE>configure</CODE> picks <CODE>c++</CODE> as the compiler name and
GNU <CODE>c++</CODE> links with <CODE>-lg++</CODE>.  If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
that behaviour can cause problems during configuration such as this:

<A NAME="IDX261"></A>

<PRE>
configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C++ compiler cannot create executables.
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
You might also observe problems during compilation related to
<CODE>g++</CODE>, <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.

One cause of these problems is that you may not have <CODE>g++</CODE>, or you may
have <CODE>g++</CODE> but not <CODE>libg++</CODE>, or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  Take a look at
the <TT>`config.log'</TT> file.  It should contain the exact reason why your c++
compiler didn't work!  To work around these problems, you can use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
as your C++ compiler.  Try setting the environment variable <CODE>CXX</CODE> to
<CODE>"gcc -O3"</CODE>.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX264"></A>
<A NAME="IDX265"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXX="gcc -O3" ./configure
</PRE>

This works because <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiles C++ sources as well as <CODE>g++</CODE>
does, but does not link in <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> by default.

Another way to fix these problems, of course, is to install <CODE>g++</CODE>,
<CODE>libg++</CODE>, and <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>.  We would however like to recommend
you to not use <CODE>libg++</CODE> or <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> with MySQL as this will
only increase the binary size of mysqld without giving you any benefits.
Some versions of these libraries have also caused strange problems for
MySQL users in the past.

<LI>

If your compile fails with errors, such as any of the following,
you must upgrade your version of <CODE>make</CODE> to GNU <CODE>make</CODE>:

If you want to define flags to be used by your C or C++ compilers, do so by
adding the flags to the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> environment
variables.  You can also specify the compiler names this way using <CODE>CC</CODE>
and <CODE>CXX</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CC=gcc
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; CXX=gcc
shell&#62; CXXFLAGS=-O3
shell&#62; export CC CFLAGS CXX CXXFLAGS
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_binaries">2.2.9  MySQL Binaries Compiled by MySQL AB</A>, for a list of flag definitions that have been found
to be useful on various systems.

<LI>

If you get an error message like this,
you need to upgrade your <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler:


<PRE>
client/libmysql.c:273: parse error before `__attribute__'
</PRE>

<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 is known to work, but we recommend using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 or
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.0.3a instead.

<LI>

If you get errors such as those shown here when compiling <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't correctly detect the type of the last argument to
<CODE>accept()</CODE>, <CODE>getsockname()</CODE>, or <CODE>getpeername()</CODE>:


<PRE>
cxx: Error: mysqld.cc, line 645: In this statement, the referenced
     type of the pointer value "&#38;length" is "unsigned long", which
     is not compatible with "int".
new_sock = accept(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&#38;cAddr, &#38;length);
</PRE>

To fix this, edit the <TT>`config.h'</TT> file (which is generated by
<CODE>configure</CODE>).  Look for these lines:


<PRE>
/* Define as the base type of the last arg to accept */
#define SOCKET_SIZE_TYPE XXX
</PRE>

Change <CODE>XXX</CODE> to <CODE>size_t</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>, depending on your
operating system.  (Note that you will have to do this each time you run
<CODE>configure</CODE> because <CODE>configure</CODE> regenerates <TT>`config.h'</TT>.)

<LI>

The <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> file is generated from <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>.  Normally
the build process doesn't need to create <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>, because
MySQL comes with an already generated copy.  However, if you do need
to re-create it, you might encounter this error:


<PRE>
"sql_yacc.yy", line xxx fatal: default action causes potential...
</PRE>

This is a sign that your version of <CODE>yacc</CODE> is deficient.
You probably need to install <CODE>bison</CODE> (the GNU version of <CODE>yacc</CODE>)
and use that instead.

<LI>

If you need to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or a MySQL client, run
<CODE>configure</CODE> with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option, then recompile and
link your clients with the new client library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_client">E.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A>.

Building in a non-source directory is not supported when using
MIT-pthreads because we want to minimise our changes to this code.

<LI>

The checks that determine whether to use MIT-pthreads occur only
during the part of the configuration process that deals with the server
code.  If you have configured the distribution using <CODE>--without-server</CODE>
to build only the client code, clients will not know whether
MIT-pthreads is being used and will use Unix socket connections by default.
Because Unix sockets do not work under MIT-pthreads on some platforms, this
means you will need to use <CODE>-h</CODE> or <CODE>--host</CODE> when you run client
programs.

<LI>

When MySQL is compiled using MIT-pthreads, system locking is
disabled by default for performance reasons.  You can tell the server to use
system locking with the <CODE>--external-locking</CODE> option.  This is only
needed if you want to be able to run two MySQL servers against the same
data files (not recommended).

<LI>

Sometimes the pthread <CODE>bind()</CODE> command fails to bind to a socket without
any error message (at least on Solaris).  The result is that all connections
to the server fail.  For example:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
mysqladmin: connect to server at '' failed;
error: 'Can't connect to mysql server on localhost (146)'
</PRE>

The solution to this is to kill the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and restart it.
This has only happened to us when we have forced the server down and done
a restart immediately.

<LI>

With MIT-pthreads, the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> system call isn't interruptible with
<CODE>SIGINT</CODE> (break).  This is only noticeable when you run
<CODE>mysqladmin --sleep</CODE>.  You must wait for the <CODE>sleep()</CODE> call to
terminate before the interrupt is served and the process stops.

<LI>

When linking, you may receive warning messages like these (at least on
Solaris); they can be ignored:


<PRE>
ld: warning: symbol `_iob' has differing sizes:
    (file /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) value=0x4;

file /usr/lib/libc.so value=0x140);
    /my/local/pthreads/lib/libpthread.a(findfp.o) definition taken
</PRE>

<LI>

Some other warnings also can be ignored:


<PRE>
implicit declaration of function `int strtoll(...)'
implicit declaration of function `int strtoul(...)'
</PRE>

<LI>

We haven't gotten <CODE>readline</CODE> to work with MIT-pthreads.  (This isn't
needed, but may be interesting for someone.)

Once you've installed MySQL (from either a binary or source
distribution), you need to initialise the grant tables, start the server,
and make sure that the server works okay.  You may also wish to arrange
for the server to be started and stopped automatically when your system
starts up and shuts down.

</P>
<P>
Normally you install the grant tables and start the server like this
for installation from a source distribution:
<A NAME="IDX283"></A>
<A NAME="IDX284"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
For a binary distribution (not RPM or pkg packages), do this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; ./scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;
or
shell&#62; ./bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &#38;
if you are running MySQL 4.x.
</PRE>

<P>
This creates the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database which will hold all database
privileges, the <CODE>test</CODE> database which you can use to test
MySQL, and also privilege entries for the user that run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and a <CODE>root</CODE> user (without any passwords).
This also starts the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> will not overwrite any old privilege tables, so
it should be safe to run in any circumstances.  If you don't want to
have the <CODE>test</CODE> database you can remove it with <CODE>mysqladmin -u
root drop test</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Testing is most easily done from the top-level directory of the MySQL
distribution.  For a binary distribution, this is your installation directory
(typically something like <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT>).  For a source
distribution, this is the main directory of your MySQL source tree.
<A NAME="IDX285"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the commands shown in this section and in the following
subsections, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is the path to the location in which programs
like <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> are installed.  For a
binary distribution, this is the <TT>`bin'</TT> directory within the
distribution.  For a source distribution, <CODE>BINDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>, unless you specified an installation directory
other than <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> when you ran <CODE>configure</CODE>.
<CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is the location in which the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is
installed.  For a binary distribution, this is the same as
<CODE>BINDIR</CODE>.  For a source distribution, <CODE>EXECDIR</CODE> is probably
<TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT>.

If necessary, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and set up the initial
MySQL grant tables containing the privileges that determine how
users are allowed to connect to the server.  This is normally done with the
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
</PRE>

Typically, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> needs to be run only the first time you
install MySQL.  Therefore, if you are upgrading an existing
installation, you can skip this step.  (However, <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> is
quite safe to use and will not update any tables that already exist, so if
you are unsure of what to do, you can always run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.)

<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> creates six tables (<CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>, and <CODE>func</CODE>) in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  A description of the initial privileges is given in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.  Briefly, these privileges allow the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user to do anything, and allow anybody to create or use databases
with a name of <CODE>test</CODE> or starting with <CODE>test_</CODE>.

If you don't set up the grant tables, the following error will appear in the
log file when you start the server:

<A NAME="IDX287"></A>

<PRE>
mysqld: Can't find file: 'host.frm'
</PRE>

This may also happen with a binary MySQL distribution if you
don't start MySQL by executing exactly <CODE>./bin/safe_mysqld</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

You might need to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE>.  However,
if you prefer, you can run the MySQL server as an unprivileged
(non-<CODE>root</CODE>) user, provided that the user can read and write files in
the database directory.  Instructions for running MySQL as an
unprivileged user are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

If you have problems with <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_install_db">2.4.1  Problems Running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE></A>.

There are some alternatives to running the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
script as it is provided in the MySQL distribution:


<UL>
<LI>

You may want to edit <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before running it, to change
the initial privileges that are installed into the grant tables.  This is
useful if you want to install MySQL on a lot of machines with the
same privileges.  In this case you probably should need only to add a few
extra <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
tables!

<LI>

If you want to change things in the grant tables after installing them, you
can run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>, then use <CODE>mysql -u root mysql</CODE> to
connect to the grant tables as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user and issue
SQL statements to modify the grant tables directly.

<LI>

It is possible to re-create the grant tables completely after they have
already been created.  You might want to do this if you've already installed
the tables but then want to re-create them after editing
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.
</UL>

For more information about these alternatives, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A>.

<LI>

Start the MySQL server like this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

If you have problems starting the server, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> to verify that the server is running.  The following
commands provide a simple test to check that the server is up and responding
to connections:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin version
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

The output from <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE> varies slightly depending on your
platform and version of MySQL, but should be similar to that shown here:


<PRE>

Verify that you can shut down the server:
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<LI>

Verify that you can restart the server.  Do this using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or
by invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.  For example:

<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/safe_mysqld --log &#38;
</PRE>

If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> fails, try running it from the MySQL
installation directory (if you are not already there).  If that doesn't work,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

There is also a benchmark suite in the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory (under the
MySQL installation directory) that you can use to compare how
MySQL performs on different platforms.  The <TT>`sql-bench/Results'</TT>
directory contains the results from many runs against different databases and
platforms.  To run all tests, execute these commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; cd sql-bench
shell&#62; run-all-tests
</PRE>

If you don't have the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory, you are probably using an
RPM for a binary distribution.  (Source distribution RPMs include the
benchmark directory.)  In this case, you must first install the benchmark
suite before you can use it.  Beginning with MySQL Version 3.22,
there are benchmark RPM files named <TT>`mysql-bench-VERSION-i386.rpm'</TT> that
contain benchmark code and data.

If you have a source distribution, you can also run the tests in the
<TT>`tests'</TT> subdirectory. For example, to run <TT>`auto_increment.tst'</TT>, do
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; BINDIR/mysql -vvf test &#60; ./tests/auto_increment.tst
</PRE>

The expected results are shown in the <TT>`./tests/auto_increment.res'</TT> file.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> doesn't install the grant tables</STRONG>
<DD>
You may find that <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> fails to install the grant
tables and terminates after displaying the following messages:


<PRE>
starting mysqld daemon with databases from XXXXXX
mysql daemon ended
</PRE>

In this case, you should examine the log file very carefully!  The log
should be located in the directory <TT>`XXXXXX'</TT> named by the error message,
and should indicate why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> didn't start.  If you don't understand
what happened, include the log when you post a bug report using
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<DT><STRONG>There is already a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon running</STRONG>
<DD>
In this case, you probably don't have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> at
all.  You have to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> only once, when you install
MySQL the first time.

<DT><STRONG>Installing a second <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon doesn't work when one daemon is running</STRONG>
<DD>
This can happen when you already have an existing MySQL
installation, but want to put a new installation in a different place (for
example, for testing, or perhaps you simply want to run two installations at
the same time).  Generally the problem that occurs when you try to run the
second server is that it tries to use the same socket and port as the old one.
In this case you will get the error message: <CODE>Can't start server: Bind on
TCP/IP port: Address already in use</CODE> or <CODE>Can't start server: Bind on
unix socket...</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_many_servers">4.1.3  Installing Many Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>

If you don't have write access to create a socket file at the default place
(in <TT>`/tmp'</TT>) or permission to create temporary files in <TT>`/tmp,'</TT>
you will get an error when running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> or when
starting or using <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

You can specify a different socket and temporary directory as follows:

<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>

<PRE>
shell&#62; TMPDIR=/some_tmp_dir/
shell&#62; MYSQL_UNIX_PORT=/some_tmp_dir/mysqld.sock
shell&#62; export TMPDIR MYSQL_UNIX_PORT
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.

<TT>`some_tmp_dir'</TT> should be the path to some directory for which you
have write permission. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

After this you should be able to run <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> and start
the server with these commands:


<PRE>
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; BINDIR/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes immediately</STRONG>
<DD>
If you are running RedHat Version 5.0 with a version of <CODE>glibc</CODE> older than

If you are going to use tables that support transactions (InnoDB, BDB),
you should first create a <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file and set startup options
for the table types you plan to use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
Generally, you start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in one of these ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.  This script is used primarily at
system startup and shutdown, and is described more fully in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, which tries to determine the proper options
for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and then runs it with those options. See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

<LI>

For Windows NT/2000/XP, please see section <A HREF="manual.html#NT_start">2.6.2.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000 or XP</A>.

<LI>

By invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly.
</UL>

<P>
When the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon starts up, it changes the directory to the
data directory.  This is where it expects to write log files and the pid
(process ID) file, and where it expects to find databases.

</P>
<P>
The data directory location is hardwired in when the distribution is
compiled.  However, if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> expects to find the data directory
somewhere other than where it really is on your system, it will not work
properly.  If you have problems with incorrect paths, you can find out
what options <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allows and what the default path settings are by
invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.  You can override the
defaults by specifying the correct pathnames as command-line arguments to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  (These options can be used with <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as well.)

</P>
<P>
Normally you should need to tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> only the base directory under
which MySQL is installed.  You can do this with the <CODE>--basedir</CODE>
option.  You can also use <CODE>--help</CODE> to check the effect of changing path
options (note that <CODE>--help</CODE> <STRONG>must</STRONG> be the final option of the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> command).  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; EXECDIR/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local --help
</PRE>

<P>
Once you determine the path settings you want, start the server without
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Whichever method you use to start the server, if it fails to start up
correctly, check the log file to see if you can find out why.  Log files
are located in the data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary distribution,
<TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source distribution, and
<TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> on Windows).  Look in the data directory for
files with names of the form <TT>`host_name.err'</TT> and
<TT>`host_name.log'</TT> where <CODE>host_name</CODE> is the name of your server
host.  Then check the last few lines of these files:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; tail host_name.err
shell&#62; tail host_name.log
</PRE>

<P>
Look for something like the following in the log file:

<PRE>
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  Recovery function for LSN 1 27595 failed
000729 14:50:10  bdb:  warning: ./test/t1.db: No such file or directory
000729 14:50:10  Can't init databases
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you didn't start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>
and Berkeley DB found something wrong with its log files when it
tried to recover your databases.  To be able to continue, you should
move away the old Berkeley DB log file from the database directory to
some other place, where you can later examine it.  The log files are
named <TT>`log.0000000001'</TT>, where the number will increase over time.

</P>
<P>
If you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with BDB table support and <CODE>mysqld</CODE> core
dumps at start this could be because of some problems with the BDB
recover log.  In this case you can try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE>.  If this helps, then you should remove all
<TT>`log.*'</TT> files from the data directory and try starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
again.

</P>

If you get the following error, it means that some other program (or another
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) is already using the TCP/IP port or socket
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use:

</P>

<PRE>
Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Address already in use
  or
Can't start server : Bind on unix socket...
</PRE>

<P>
Use <CODE>ps</CODE> to make sure that you don't have another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
running.  If you can't find another server running, you can try to execute
the command <CODE>telnet your-host-name tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press
Enter a couple of times.  If you don't get an error message like
<CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused</CODE>,
something is using the TCP/IP port <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to use.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_install_db">2.4.1  Problems Running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE></A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Multiple_servers">4.1.4  Running Multiple MySQL Servers on the Same Machine</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is currently running, you can find out what path settings
it is using by executing this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'your-host-name' variables

<P>
If you get <CODE>Errcode 13</CODE>, which means <CODE>Permission denied</CODE>, when
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> this means that you didn't have the right to
read/create files in the MySQL database or log directory. In this case
you should either start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as the root user or change the
permissions for the involved files and directories so that you have the
right to use them.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> starts the server but you can't connect to it,
you should make sure you have an entry in <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> that looks like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<P>
This problem occurs only on systems that don't have a working thread
library and for which MySQL must be configured to use MIT-pthreads.

</P>
<P>
If you can't get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to start you can try to make a trace file
to find the problem. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>

The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> and <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> scripts can be used to start
the server automatically at system startup time. <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can also
be used to stop the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script can be used to start or stop the server
by invoking it with <CODE>start</CODE> or <CODE>stop</CODE> arguments:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql.server start
shell&#62; mysql.server stop
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`share/mysql'</TT> directory
under the MySQL installation directory or in the <TT>`support-files'</TT>
directory of the MySQL source tree.

</P>
<P>
Before <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> starts the server, it changes the directory to
the MySQL installation directory, then invokes <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
You might need to edit <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> if you have a binary distribution
that you've installed in a non-standard location.  Modify it to <CODE>cd</CODE>
into the proper directory before it runs <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>. If you want the
server to run as some specific user, add an appropriate <CODE>user</CODE> line
to the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> file, as shown later in this section.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql.server stop</CODE> brings down the server by sending a signal to it.
You can also take down the server manually by executing
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You need to add these start and stop commands to the appropriate places
in your <TT>`/etc/rc*'</TT> files when you want to start up MySQL automatically
on your server.

</P>
<P>
On most current Linux distributions, it is sufficient to copy the file
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> into the <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> directory (or
<TT>`/etc/rc.d/init.d'</TT> on older Red Hat systems). Afterwards, run the
following command to enable the startup of MySQL on system bootup:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; chkconfig --add mysql.server
</PRE>

<P>
As an alternative to the above, some operating systems also use
<TT>`/etc/rc.local'</TT> or <TT>`/etc/init.d/boot.local'</TT> to start additional
services on bootup. To start up MySQL using this method, you could append
something like the following to it:

</P>

<PRE>
/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/local/mysql ; ./bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql &#38;'
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>
You can also add options for <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> in a global

</P>
<P>
You can always move the MySQL form and datafiles between
different versions on the same architecture as long as you have the same
base version of MySQL. The current base version is
3. If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may
also change the sort order), you must run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
--set-character-set=charset</CODE> on all
tables.  Otherwise, your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

</P>
<P>
If you are afraid of new versions, you can always rename your old
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to something like <CODE>mysqld-old-version-number</CODE>.  If
your new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> then does something unexpected, you can simply shut it
down and restart with your old <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!

</P>
<P>
When you do an upgrade you should also back up your old databases, of course.

</P>
<P>
If after an upgrade, you experience problems with recompiled client programs,
like <CODE>Commands out of sync</CODE> or unexpected core dumps, you probably have
used an old header or library file when compiling your programs.  In this
case you should check the date for your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file and
<TT>`libmysqlclient.a'</TT> library to verify that they are from the new
MySQL distribution.  If not, please recompile your programs!

</P>
<P>
If you get some problems that the new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't want to
start or that you can't connect without a password, check that you don't
have some old <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file from your old installation!  You can
check this with: <CODE>program-name --print-defaults</CODE>.  If this outputs
anything other than the program name, you have an active <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file that will affect things!

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE>
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as all your <CODE>DBI</CODE> scripts
dumping core after you upgrade MySQL.

<P>
In general what you have to do when upgrading to 4.1 from an earlier
MySQL version:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Run the script <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> to generate the new
password field that is needed for secure handling of passwords.
</UL>

<P>
The following is a more complete lists tell what you have to watch out
for when upgrading to version 4.1;

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Functions that return a DATE, DATETIME or TIME result is now fixed
up when returned to the client.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT cast("2001-1-1" as DATE)
    -&#62; '2001-01-01'
</PRE>

<LI>

All column and tables now have a character set, which shows up in
<CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
(MySQL 4.0.6 and above can read the new dump files, but not previous
MySQL versions).
<LI>

Timestamp is now returned as string of type <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD'</CODE>.
If you want to have this as a number you should add +0 to the timestamp
column.  Different timestamp lengths are not supported.
<LI>

If you are running multiple servers on the same windows machine, you should
use a different <CODE>--shared_memory_base_name</CODE> option on all machines.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that the table definition format (.frm) has changed
slightly in 4.1.  MySQL 4.0.11 can read the new .frm format but older
version can not.  If you need to go move tables from 4.1 to and earlier
MySQL version you should use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.5  <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.23" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.23">2.5.2  Upgrading From Version 3.23 to Version 4.0</A></H3>

<P>
In general what you have to do when upgrading to 4.0 from an earlier
MySQL version:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Run the script <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> to add new 
privileges and features
to the MySQL privilege tables.
<LI>

Edit any MySQL startup scripts or configure files to not use any of the
deprecated options listed below.
<LI>

Convert your old ISAM files to MyISAM files with the command:
<CODE>mysql_convert_table_format database</CODE>.  Note that this should only
be run if all tables in the given database is ISAM or MyISAM tables. If
this is not the case you should run <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM</CODE>
on all ISAM tables.
<LI>

Ensure that you don't have any MySQL clients that uses shared libraries
(like the Perl Msql-Mysql-modules). If you have, you should recompile
them as structures used in <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> have changed.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL 4.0 will work even if you don't do the above, but you will not be
able to use the new security privileges that MySQL 4.0 and you may run
into problems when upgrading later to MySQL 4.1 or newer.  The ISAM file
format still works in MySQL 4.0 but it's deprecated and will be disabled
in MySQL 5.0.

</P>
<P>
Old clients should work with a Version 4.0 server without any problems.

</P>
<P>
Even if you do the above, you can still downgrade to MySQL 3.23.52 or
newer if you run into problems with the MySQL 4.0 series.  In this case
you have to do a <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> of any tables using a full-text index
and restore these in 3.23 (because 4.0 uses a new format for full-text
index).

</P>
<P>
The following is a more complete lists tell what you have to watch out
for when upgrading to version 4.0;

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL 4.0 has a lot of new privileges in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To get these new privileges to work, one must run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script.  Until this script is run all
users have the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>,
and <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> privileges. <CODE>SUPER</CODE> and <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE>
privileges take their value from <CODE>PROCESS</CODE>.
<CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE> and <CODE>REPLICATION CLIENT</CODE> take their
values from <CODE>FILE</CODE>.

If you have any scripts that creates new users, you may want to change
them to use the new privileges.  If you are not using <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
commands in the scripts, this is a good time to change your scripts.

In version 4.0.2 the option <CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE> is deprecated
(and no longer does anything). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges_options">4.2.3  Startup Options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Concerning Security</A>.

If you get access denied errors for new users in version 4.0.2, you
should check if you need some of the new grants that you didn't need
before.  In particular, you will need <CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE>
(instead of <CODE>FILE</CODE>) for new slaves.
<LI>

The startup parameters <CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE> and
<CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE> are now given in bytes
(was megabytes before 4.0.3).
External system locking of MyISAM/ISAM files is now turned off by default.
One can turn this on by doing <CODE>--external-locking</CODE>. (For most users
this is never needed).
<LI>

The following startup variables/options have been renamed:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<LI>

You have to use <CODE>SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#</CODE> instead of
<CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=#</CODE>.
<LI>

Renamed mysqld startup options <CODE>--skip-locking</CODE> to
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> and <CODE>--enable-locking</CODE> to
<CODE>--external-locking</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> now returns an empty set if binary log is not
enabled.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> now returns an empty set if slave is not initialised.
<LI>

mysqld now has the option <CODE>--temp-pool</CODE> enabled by default as this
gives better performance with some OS (Most notable Linux).
<LI>

<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> and <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> columns now honour the
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> flag on storage (before, <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> was ignored for
these columns).
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY column DESC</CODE> now always sorts <CODE>NULL</CODE> values
first; in 3.23 this was not always consistent. Note: MySQL 4.0.11 restored
the original behaviour.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE> has 2 columns more (<CODE>Null</CODE> and <CODE>Index_type</CODE>)
than it had in 3.23.
<LI>

<CODE>CHECK</CODE>, <CODE>SIGNED</CODE>, <CODE>LOCALTIME</CODE> and <CODE>LOCALTIMESTAMP</CODE>
are now reserved words.
<LI>

The result of all bitwise operators <CODE>|</CODE>, <CODE>&#38;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#62;&#62;</CODE>, and <CODE>~</CODE> is now unsigned.  This may cause problems if you
are using them in a context where you want a signed result.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.
<LI>

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: when you use subtraction between integer values where
one is of type <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the result will be unsigned!  In other
words, before upgrading to MySQL 4.0, you should check your application
for cases where you are subtracting a value from an unsigned entity and
want a negative answer or subtracting an unsigned value from an
integer column. You can disable this behaviour by using the
<CODE>--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> option when starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.
<LI>

To use <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST (... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE> with your tables,
you need to rebuild them with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE table_name USE_FRM</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCATE()</CODE> and <CODE>INSTR()</CODE> are case-sensitive if one of the
arguments is a binary string. Otherwise they are case-insensitive.
<LI>

<CODE>STRCMP()</CODE> now uses the current character set when doing comparisons,
which means that the default comparison behaviour now is case-insensitive.
<LI>

<CODE>HEX(string)</CODE> now returns the characters in string converted to
hexadecimal.  If you want to convert a number to hexadecimal, you should
ensure that you call <CODE>HEX()</CODE> with a numeric argument.
<LI>

In 3.23, <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</CODE> always had <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> enabled.
In 4.0.1, MySQL will stop (and possibly roll back) in case of an error if you
don't specify <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>.
<LI>

<TT>`safe_mysqld'</TT> is renamed to <TT>`mysqld_safe'</TT>.  For some time we
will in our binary distributions include <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as a symlink to
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.
<LI>

The old C API functions <CODE>mysql_drop_db</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_create_db</CODE>, and
<CODE>mysql_connect</CODE> are not supported anymore, unless you compile
MySQL with <CODE>CFLAGS=-DUSE_OLD_FUNCTIONS</CODE>.  Instead of doing this,
it is preferable to change the client to use the new 4.0 API.
<LI>

In the <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structure, <CODE>length</CODE> and <CODE>max_length</CODE> have
changed from <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>. This should not
cause any problems, except that they may generate warning messages when
used as arguments in the <CODE>printf()</CODE> class of functions.
<LI>

You should use <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> when you want to delete all rows
from a table and you don't care how many rows were deleted.
(Because <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> is faster than <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE>).
<LI>

You will get an error if you have an active <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> or
transaction when trying to execute <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP
DATABASE</CODE>.
<LI>

You should use integers to store values in BIGINT columns (instead of using
strings, as you did in MySQL 3.23).  Using strings will still work, but using
integers is more efficient.
<LI>

Format of <CODE>SHOW OPEN TABLE</CODE> has changed.
<LI>

Multi-threaded clients should use <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_thread_end()</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.8  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.
<LI>

If you want to recompile the Perl DBD::mysql module, you must get
Msql-Mysql-modules version 1.2218 or newer because the older DBD modules
used the deprecated <CODE>drop_db()</CODE> call.
<LI>

<CODE>RAND(seed)</CODE> returns a different random number series in 4.0 than in
3.23; this was done to further differentiate <CODE>RAND(seed)</CODE> and
<CODE>RAND(seed+1)</CODE>.
<LI>

The default type returned by <CODE>IFNULL(A,B)</CODE> is now set to be the
more 'general' of the types of <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>. (The order is
<CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>).

<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL Version 3.23 supports tables of the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> type and
the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE> type.  You don't have to convert your old tables to
use these with Version 3.23.  By default, all new tables will be created with
type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> (unless you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the
<CODE>--default-table-type=isam</CODE> option). You can change an <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
table to a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table with <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name TYPE=MyISAM</CODE>
or the Perl script <CODE>mysql_convert_table_format</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Version 3.22 and 3.21 clients will work without any problems with a Version
3.23 server.

</P>
<P>
The following list tells what you have to watch out for when upgrading to
Version 3.23:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All tables that use the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set must be fixed
with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

If you do a <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> on a symbolic linked database, both the
link and the original database are deleted.  (This didn't happen in 3.22
because configure didn't detect the <CODE>readlink</CODE> system call.)

<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> now works only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
For other table types, you can use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to optimise the table.
During <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> the table is now locked from other threads.

<LI>

The MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> is now by default started with the
option <CODE>--no-named-commands (-g)</CODE>. This option can be disabled with
<CODE>--enable-named-commands (-G)</CODE>. This may cause incompatibility problems in
some cases@-for example, in SQL scripts that use named commands without a
semicolon!  Long format commands still work from the first line.

<LI>

Date functions that work on parts of dates (like <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>) will now
return 0 for <CODE>0000-00-00</CODE> dates. (MySQL 3.22 returned <CODE>NULL</CODE>.)

<LI>

If you are using the <CODE>german</CODE> character sort order, you must repair
all your tables with <CODE>isamchk -r</CODE>, as we have made some changes in
the sort order!

<LI>

The default return type of <CODE>IF</CODE> will now depend on both arguments
and not only the first argument.

<LI>

<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> will not work with negative numbers. The reason
for this is that negative numbers caused problems when wrapping from -1 to 0.
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> for MyISAM tables is now handled at a lower level and
is much faster than before. For MyISAM tables old numbers are also not reused
anymore, even if you delete some rows from the table.

<LI>

<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>, <CODE>ELSE</CODE>, <CODE>END</CODE>, <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>,
<CODE>INNER</CODE>, <CODE>RIGHT</CODE>, <CODE>THEN</CODE>, and <CODE>WHEN</CODE> are now reserved words.

<LI>

<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> is now a true floating-point type and not a value with a
fixed number of decimals.

<LI>

When declaring <CODE>DECIMAL(length,dec)</CODE> the length argument no longer
includes a place for the sign or the decimal point.

<LI>

A <CODE>TIME</CODE> string must now be of one of the following formats:
<CODE>[[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]</CODE> or
<CODE>[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> now compares strings using the same character comparison rules
as <CODE>=</CODE>.  If you require the old behaviour, you can compile
MySQL with the <CODE>CXXFLAGS=-DLIKE_CMP_TOUPPER</CODE> flag.

<LI>

<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is now case-insensitive for normal (not binary) strings.

<LI>

When you check/repair tables you should use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (<TT>`.MYI'</TT>) and
<CODE>isamchk</CODE> for ISAM (<TT>`.ISM'</TT>) tables.

<LI>

If you want your <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> files to be compatible between
MySQL Version 3.22 and Version 3.23, you should not use the
<CODE>--opt</CODE> or <CODE>--all</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

<LI>

Check all your calls to <CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> to make sure there is a
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before each format character.
(MySQL Version 3.22 and later already allowed this syntax.)

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_fetch_fields_direct</CODE> is now a function (it was a macro) and
it returns a pointer to a <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> can no longer be used on a <CODE>MYSQL*</CODE> object (it's
now a function that takes <CODE>MYSQL_RES*</CODE> as an argument, so you should
use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead).

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT ...</CODE> was
almost always sorted.  In Version 3.23, you must use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> to obtain sorted output.

<LI>

<CODE>SUM()</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>, instead of 0, if
there are no matching rows. This is according to ANSI SQL.

<LI>

An <CODE>AND</CODE> or <CODE>OR</CODE> with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values will now return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of 0. This mostly affects queries that use <CODE>NOT</CODE>
on an <CODE>AND/OR</CODE> expression as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> = <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<CODE>LPAD()</CODE> and <CODE>RPAD()</CODE> will shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>

</P>
<P>
Nothing that affects compatibility has changed between versions 3.21 and 3.22.
The only pitfall is that new tables that are created with <CODE>DATE</CODE> type
columns will use the new way to store the date. You can't access these new
fields from an old version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL Version 3.22, you should start the new server
and then run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script. This will add the
new privileges that you need to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.  If you forget
this, you will get <CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you try to use <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>, or <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE>. If your MySQL root
user requires a password, you should give this as an argument to
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The C API interface to <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> has changed.  If you have
an old client program that calls this function, you must place a <CODE>0</CODE> for
the new <CODE>db</CODE> argument (or recode the client to send the <CODE>db</CODE>
element for faster connections).  You must also call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE>
before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>!  This change was done to allow
the new <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> function to save options in the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
handler structure.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variable <CODE>key_buffer</CODE> has changed names to
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>, but you can still use the old name in your
startup files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-from-3.20" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-from-3.20">2.5.5  Upgrading from Version 3.20 to Version 3.21</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are running a version older than Version 3.20.28 and want to
switch to Version 3.21, you need to do the following:

</P>
<P>
You can start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Version 3.21 server with <CODE>safe_mysqld
--old-protocol</CODE> to use it with clients from a Version 3.20 distribution.
In this case, the new client function <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> will not
return any server error, only <CODE>CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR</CODE> (but it
works for client errors), and the server uses the old <CODE>password()</CODE>
checking rather than the new one.

</P>
<P>
If you are <STRONG>not</STRONG> using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will need to make the following changes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All client code must be recompiled. If you are using ODBC, you must get
the new <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 2.x driver.
<LI>

The script <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> must be run to convert the
<CODE>Password</CODE> field in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table to <CODE>CHAR(16)</CODE>.
<LI>

All passwords must be reassigned in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table (to get 62-bit
rather than 31-bit passwords).
<LI>

The table format hasn't changed, so you don't have to convert any tables.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL Version 3.20.28 and above can handle the new <CODE>user</CODE> table
format without affecting clients. If you have a MySQL version earlier
than Version 3.20.28, passwords will no longer work with it if you convert the
<CODE>user</CODE> table. So to be safe, you should first upgrade to at least Version
3.20.28 and then upgrade to Version 3.21.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
The new client code works with a 3.20.x <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, so
if you experience problems with 3.21.x, you can use the old 3.20.x server
without having to recompile the clients again.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
old clients will issue the error message:

</P>

<PRE>
ERROR: Protocol mismatch. Server Version = 10 Client Version = 9
</PRE>

<P>
The new Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> interface also supports the old
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> interface.  The only change you have to make if you use
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> is to change the arguments to the <CODE>connect()</CODE> function.
The new arguments are: <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>database</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE>,
and <CODE>password</CODE> (the <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>password</CODE> arguments have changed
places).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_DBI_Class">8.2.2  The <CODE>DBI</CODE> Interface</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following changes may affect queries in old applications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> must now be specified before any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.
<LI>

The parameters to <CODE>LOCATE()</CODE> have been swapped.
<LI>

There are some new reserved words. The most notable are <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Upgrading-to-arch" HREF="manual_toc.html#Upgrading-to-arch">2.5.6  Upgrading to Another Architecture</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX319"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23, you can copy the <TT>`.frm'</TT>,
<TT>`.MYI'</TT>, and <TT>`.MYD'</TT> files between different architectures that
support the same floating-point format.  (MySQL takes care of any
byte-swapping issues.)

</P>
<P>
The MySQL <CODE>ISAM</CODE> data and index files (<TT>`.ISD'</TT> and
<TT>`*.ISM'</TT>, respectively) are architecture-dependent and in some cases
OS-dependent.  If you want to move your applications to another machine
that has a different architecture or OS than your current machine, you
should not try to move a database by simply copying the files to the
other machine. Use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create a file full of SQL statements.
You can then transfer the file to the other machine and feed it as input
to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.

</P>
<P>
Try <CODE>mysqldump --help</CODE> to see what options are available.
If you are moving the data to a newer version of MySQL, you should use
<CODE>mysqldump --opt</CODE> with the newer version to get a fast, compact dump.

</P>
<P>
The easiest (although not the fastest) way to move a database between two
machines is to run the following commands on the machine on which the
database is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'other hostname' create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump --opt db_name \
        | mysql -h 'other hostname' db_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to copy a database from a remote machine over a slow network,
you can use:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; mysqldump -h 'other hostname' --opt --compress db_name \
        | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can also store the result in a file, then transfer the file to the
target machine and load the file into the database there.  For example,
you can dump a database to a file on the source machine like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqldump --quick db_name | gzip &#62; db_name.contents.gz
</PRE>

<P>
(The file created in this example is compressed.) Transfer the file
containing the database contents to the target machine and run these commands
there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; db_name.contents.gz | mysql db_name
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
You can also use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> and <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to accomplish
the database transfer.
For big tables, this is much faster than simply using <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.
In the following commands, <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> represents the full pathname
of the directory you use to store the output from <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
First, create the directory for the output files and dump the database:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mkdir DUMPDIR
shell&#62; mysqldump --tab=DUMPDIR db_name
</PRE>

<P>
Then transfer the files in the <CODE>DUMPDIR</CODE> directory to some corresponding
directory on the target machine and load the files into MySQL
there:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create db_name           # create database
shell&#62; cat DUMPDIR/*.sql | mysql db_name   # create tables in database
shell&#62; mysqlimport db_name DUMPDIR/*.txt   # load data into tables
</PRE>

<P>
Also, don't forget to copy the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database because that's where the
grant tables (<CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, <CODE>host</CODE>) are stored.  You may have
to run commands as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user on the new machine
until you have the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database in place.

</P>
<P>
After you import the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database on the new machine, execute
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> so that the server reloads the grant table
information.

</P>

<H3><A NAME="Linux" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux">2.6.1  Linux Notes (All Linux Versions)</A></H3>

<P>
The following notes regarding <CODE>glibc</CODE> apply only to the situation
when you build MySQL
yourself. If you are running Linux on an x86 machine, in most cases it is
much better for you to just use our binary. We link our binaries against
the best patched version of <CODE>glibc</CODE> we can come up with and with the
best compiler options, in an attempt to make it suitable for a high-load
server. So if you read the following text, and are in doubt about
what you should do, try our binary first to see if it meets your needs, and
worry about your own build only after you have discovered that our binary is
not good enough. In that case, we would appreciate a note about it, so we
can build a better binary next time. For a typical user, even for setups with
a lot of concurrent connections and/or tables exceeding the 2G limit, our
binary in most cases is the best choice.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses LinuxThreads on Linux.  If you are using an old
Linux version that doesn't have <CODE>glibc2</CODE>, you must install
LinuxThreads before trying to compile MySQL.   You can get
LinuxThreads at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: we have seen some strange problems with Linux 2.2.14 and
MySQL on SMP systems. If you have a SMP system, we recommend
you upgrade to Linux 2.4 as soon as possible!  Your system will be
faster and more stable by doing this!

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>glibc</CODE> versions before and including Version 2.1.1 have
a fatal bug in <CODE>pthread_mutex_timedwait</CODE> handling, which is used
when you do <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  We recommend that you not use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> before upgrading glibc.

</P>
<P>
If you plan to have 1000+ concurrent connections, you will need to make
some changes to LinuxThreads, recompile it, and relink MySQL against
the new <TT>`libpthread.a'</TT>.  Increase <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE> in
<TT>`sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/local_lim.h'</TT> to 4096 and decrease
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in <TT>`linuxthreads/internals.h'</TT> to 256 KB. The paths are
relative to the root of <CODE>glibc</CODE> Note that MySQL will not be
stable with around 600-1000 connections if <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> is the default
of 2 MB.

</P>
<P>
If MySQL can't open enough files,
or connections, it may be that you haven't configured Linux to handle
enough files.

</P>
<P>
In Linux 2.2 and onward, you can check the number of allocated
file handles by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
cat /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
cat /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
If you have more than 16 MB of memory, you should add something like the
following to your init scripts (e.g. <TT>`/etc/init.d/boot.local'</TT> on SuSE Linux):

</P>

<PRE>
echo 65536 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo 8192 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
echo 1024 &#62; /proc/sys/fs/super-max
</PRE>

<P>
You can also run the preceding commands from the command-line as root, but
these settings will be lost the next time your computer reboots.

</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you can set these parameters on bootup by using the
<CODE>sysctl</CODE> tool, which is used by many Linux distributions (SuSE has
added it as well, beginning with SuSE Linux 8.0). Just put the following
values into a file named <TT>`/etc/sysctl.conf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
# Increase some values for MySQL
fs.file-max = 65536
fs.dquot-max = 8192
fs.super-max = 1024
</PRE>

<P>
You should also add the following to <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
[safe_mysqld]
open-files-limit=8192
</PRE>

<P>
This should allow MySQL to create up to 8192 connections + files.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> constant in LinuxThreads controls the spacing of thread
stacks in the address space.  It needs to be large enough so that there will
be plenty of room for the stack of each individual thread, but small enough
to keep the stack of some threads from running into the global <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
data.  Unfortunately, the Linux implementation of <CODE>mmap()</CODE>, as we have
experimentally discovered, will successfully unmap an already mapped region
if you ask it to map out an address already in use, zeroing out the data
on the entire page, instead of returning an error.  So, the safety of
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> or any other threaded application depends on the "gentleman"
behaviour of the code that creates threads.  The user must take measures to
make sure the number of running threads at any time is sufficiently low for
thread stacks to stay away from the global heap.  With <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you
should enforce this "gentleman" behaviour by setting a reasonable value for
the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
If you build MySQL yourself and do not want to mess with patching
LinuxThreads, you should set <CODE>max_connections</CODE> to a value no higher
than 500.  It should be even less if you have a large key buffer,  large
heap tables, or some other things that make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> allocate a lot
of memory, or if you are running a 2.2 kernel with a 2G patch. If you are
using our binary or RPM version 3.23.25 or later, you can safely set
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> at 1500, assuming no large key buffer or heap tables
with lots of data.  The more you reduce <CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> in LinuxThreads
the more threads you can safely create.  We recommend the values between
128K and 256K.

</P>
<P>
If you use a lot of concurrent connections, you may suffer from a "feature"
in the 2.2 kernel that penalises a process for forking or cloning a child
in an attempt to prevent a fork bomb attack.  This will cause MySQL
not to scale well as you increase the number of concurrent clients.  On
single-CPU systems, we have seen this manifested in a very slow thread
creation, which means it may take a long time to connect to MySQL
(as long as 1 minute), and it may take just as long to shut it down.  On
multiple-CPU systems, we have observed a gradual drop in query speed as
the number of clients increases.  In the process of trying to find a
solution, we have received a kernel patch from one of our users, who
claimed it made a lot of difference for his site.  The patch is available at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Patches/linux-fork.patch</a>. We have
now done rather extensive testing of this patch on both development and
production systems.  It has significantly
improved <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performance without causing any problems and we now
recommend it to our users who are still running high-load servers on
2.2 kernels.  This issue has been fixed in the 2.4 kernel, so if you are not
satisfied with
the current performance of your system, rather than patching your 2.2 kernel,
it might be easier to just upgrade to 2.4, which will also give you a nice
SMP boost in addition to fixing this fairness bug.

</P>
<P>
We have tested MySQL on the 2.4 kernel on a 2-CPU machine and
found MySQL scales <STRONG>much</STRONG> better@-there was virtually no slowdown
on queries throughput all the way up
to 1000 clients, and the MySQL scaling factor (computed as the ratio of
maximum throughput to the throughput with one client) was 180%.
We have observed similar results on a 4-CPU system@-virtually no
slowdown as the number of
clients was increased up to 1000, and 300% scaling factor. So for a high-load
SMP server we would definitely recommend the 2.4 kernel at this point. We
have discovered that it is essential to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process with the
highest possible priority on the 2.4 kernel to achieve maximum performance.
This can be done by adding
<CODE>renice -20 $$</CODE> command to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>. In our testing on a
4-CPU machine, increasing the priority gave 60% increase in throughput with
400 clients.

</P>
<P>
We are currently also trying to collect
more info on how well <CODE>MySQL</CODE> performs on 2.4 kernel on 4-way and 8-way
systems. If you have access such a system and have done some benchmarks,
please send a mail to <a HREF="mailto:docs@mysql.com">docs@mysql.com</a> with the results - we will
include them in the manual.

</P>
<P>
There is another issue that greatly hurts MySQL performance,
especially on SMP systems.  The implementation of mutex in
LinuxThreads in <CODE>glibc-2.1</CODE> is very bad for programs with many
threads that only
hold the mutex for a short time. On an SMP system, ironic as it is, if
you link MySQL against unmodified <CODE>LinuxThreads</CODE>,
removing processors from the machine improves MySQL performance
in many cases.  We have made a patch available for <CODE>glibc 2.1.3</CODE>
to correct this behaviour
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.1-patch</a>).

</P>
<P>
With <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE>
MySQL version 3.23.36 will use the adaptive mutex, which is much
better than even the patched one in <CODE>glibc-2.1.3</CODE>. Be warned, however,
that under some conditions, the current mutex code in <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE>
overspins, which hurts MySQL performance. The chance of this
condition can be reduced by renicing <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process to the highest
priority. We have also been able to correct the overspin behaviour with
a patch, available at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Linux/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch</a>.
It combines the correction of overspin, maximum number of
threads, and stack spacing all in one. You will need to apply it in the
<CODE>linuxthreads</CODE> directory with
<CODE>patch -p0 &#60;/tmp/linuxthreads-2.2.2.patch</CODE>.
We hope it will be included in
some form in to the future releases of <CODE>glibc-2.2</CODE>. In any case, if
you link against <CODE>glibc-2.2.2</CODE> you still need to correct
<CODE>STACK_SIZE</CODE> and <CODE>PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX</CODE>. We hope that the defaults
will be corrected to some more acceptable values for high-load
MySQL setup in the future, so that your own build can be reduced
to <CODE>./configure; make; make install</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that you use the above patches to build a special static
version of <CODE>libpthread.a</CODE> and use it only for statically linking
against <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. We know that the patches are safe for <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
and significantly improve its performance, but we cannot say anything
about other applications. If you link other applications against the
patched version of the library, or build a patched shared version and
install it on your system, you are doing it at your own risk with regard
to other applications that depend on <CODE>LinuxThreads</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you experience any strange problems during the installation of
MySQL, or with some common utilties hanging, it is very likely that
they are either library or compiler related. If this is the case, using our
binary will resolve them.

</P>
<P>
One known problem with the binary distribution is that with older Linux
systems that use <CODE>libc</CODE> (like RedHat 4.x or Slackware), you will get
some non-fatal problems with hostname resolution.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_notes-Linux">2.6.1.1  Linux Notes for Binary Distributions</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using LinuxThreads you will see a minimum of three processes
running.  These are in fact threads.  There will be one thread for the
LinuxThreads manager, one thread to handle connections, and one thread
to handle alarms and signals.

</P>
<P>
Note that the Linux kernel and the LinuxThread library can by default
only have 1024 threads.  This means that you can only have up to 1021
connections to MySQL on an unpatched system.  The page
<a HREF="http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html">http://www.volano.com/linuxnotes.html</a> contains information how to
go around this limit.

</P>
<P>
If you see a dead <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon process with <CODE>ps</CODE>, this usually
means that you have found a bug in MySQL or you have a corrupted
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a <CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE> signal,
you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.  Note
that you also probably need to raise the <CODE>core file size</CODE> by adding
<CODE>ulimit -c 1000000</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or starting
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--core-file-size=1000000</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

If you are linking your own MySQL client and get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.4:
open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
When executing them, the problem can be avoided by one of the following
methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/path-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <CODE>libmysqclient.so</CODE> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using the Fujitsu compiler <CODE>(fcc / FCC)</CODE> you will have
some problems compiling MySQL because the Linux header files are very
<CODE>gcc</CODE> oriented.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
<A NAME="IDX325"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL needs at least Linux Version 2.0.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>:
We have reports from some MySQL users that they have got serious
stability problems with MySQL with Linux kernel 2.2.14.  If you are
using this kernel you should upgrade to 2.2.19 (or newer) or to a 2.4
kernel.  If you have a multi-cpu box, then you should seriously consider
using 2.4 as this will give you a significant speed boost.

</P>
<P>
The binary release is linked with <CODE>-static</CODE>, which means you do not
normally need to worry about which version of the system libraries you
have. You need not install LinuxThreads, either.  A program linked with
<CODE>-static</CODE> is slightly bigger than a dynamically linked program but
also slightly faster (3-5%).  One problem, however, is that you can't use
user-definable functions (UDFs) with a statically linked program.  If
you are going to write or use UDF functions (this is something only for
C or C++ programmers), you must compile MySQL yourself, using
dynamic linking.

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>libc</CODE>-based system (instead of a <CODE>glibc2</CODE>
system), you will probably get some problems with hostname resolving and
<CODE>getpwnam()</CODE> with the binary release. (This is because <CODE>glibc</CODE>
unfortunately depends on some external libraries to resolve hostnames
and <CODE>getpwent()</CODE>, even when compiled with <CODE>-static</CODE>). In this
case you probably get the following error message when you run
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
Sorry, the host 'xxxx' could not be looked up
</PRE>

<P>
or the following error when you try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--user</CODE>
option:

</P>

<PRE>
getpwnam: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
You can solve this problem in one of the following ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get a MySQL source distribution (an RPM or the <CODE>tar.gz</CODE>
distribution) and install this instead.
<LI>

Execute <CODE>mysql_install_db --force</CODE>; this will not execute the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.  The downside is that
you can't use host names in the grant tables; you must use IP numbers
instead (except for <CODE>localhost</CODE>).  If you are using an old MySQL
release that doesn't support <CODE>--force</CODE>, you have to remove the
<CODE>resolveip</CODE> test in <CODE>mysql_install</CODE> with an editor.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>su</CODE> instead of using <CODE>--user</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The Linux-Intel binary and RPM releases of MySQL are configured
for the highest possible speed.  We are always trying to use the fastest
stable compiler available.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support requires Version Perl 5.004_03 or newer.

</P>
<P>
On some Linux 2.2 versions, you may get the error <CODE>Resource
temporarily unavailable</CODE> when you do a lot of new connections to a
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server over TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
The problem is that Linux has a delay between when you close a TCP/IP
socket and until this is actually freed by the system.  As there is only
room for a finite number of TCP/IP slots, you will get the above error if
you try to do too many new TCP/IP connections during a small time, like
when you run the MySQL <TT>`test-connect'</TT> benchmark over
TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
We have mailed about this problem a couple of times to different Linux
mailing lists but have never been able to resolve this properly.

</P>
<P>
The only known 'fix' to this problem is to use persistent connections in
your clients or use sockets, if you are running the database server
and clients on the same machine.  We hope that the <CODE>Linux 2.4</CODE>
kernel will fix this problem in the future.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-x86" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-x86">2.6.1.2  Linux x86 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL requires <CODE>libc</CODE> Version 5.4.12 or newer. It's known to
work with <CODE>libc</CODE> 5.4.46.  <CODE>glibc</CODE> Version 2.0.6 and later should
also work. There have been some problems with the <CODE>glibc</CODE> RPMs from
RedHat, so if you have problems, check whether there are any updates!
The <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.0.7-19 and 2.0.7-29 RPMs are known to work.

</P>
<P>
If you are using Red Hat 8.0 or a new glibc 2.2.x library you should start
mysqld with the option <CODE>--thread-stack=192K</CODE>.  If you don't do it
mysqld will die in <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> because the new glibc library
requires &#62; 128K memory on stack for this call. This stack size is now the
default on MySQL 4.0.10 and above.

</P>
<P>
If you are using gcc 3.0 and above to compile MySQL, you must install
the <CODE>libstdc++v3</CODE> library before compiling MySQL; if you don't do
this you will get an error about a missing <CODE>__cxa_pure_virtual</CODE>
symbol during linking!

</P>
<P>
On some older Linux distributions, <CODE>configure</CODE> may produce an error
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Syntax error in sched.h. Change _P to __P in the /usr/include/sched.h file.
See the Installation chapter in the Reference Manual.
</PRE>

<P>
Just do what the error message says and add an extra underscore to the
<CODE>_P</CODE> macro that has only one underscore, then try again.

</P>
<P>
You may get some warnings when compiling; those shown here can be ignored:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld.cc -o objs-thread/mysqld.o
mysqld.cc: In function `void init_signals()':
mysqld.cc:315: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
`long unsigned int'
mysqld.cc: In function `void * signal_hand(void *)':
mysqld.cc:346: warning: assignment of negative value `-1' to
`long unsigned int'
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> can be found in the <TT>`share/mysql'</TT> directory
under the MySQL installation directory or in the
<TT>`support-files'</TT> directory of the MySQL source tree.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> always core dumps when it starts up, the problem may be that
you have an old <TT>`/lib/libc.a'</TT>.  Try renaming it, then remove
<TT>`sql/mysqld'</TT> and do a new <CODE>make install</CODE> and try again.  This
problem has been reported on some Slackware installations.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error when linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE>,
it means that your <TT>`libg++.a'</TT> is not installed correctly:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/lib/libc.a(putc.o): In function `_IO_putc':
putc.o(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `_IO_putc'
</PRE>

<P>
You can avoid using <TT>`libg++.a'</TT> by running <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CXX=gcc ./configure
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-SPARC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-SPARC">2.6.1.3  Linux SPARC Notes</A></H4>

<P>
In some implementations, <CODE>readdir_r()</CODE> is broken.  The symptom is that
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> always returns an empty set.  This can be fixed by
removing <CODE>HAVE_READDIR_R</CODE> from <TT>`config.h'</TT> after configuring and
before compiling.

</P>
<P>
Some problems will require patching your Linux installation.  The patch can
be found at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/patches/Linux-sparc-2.0.30.diff">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/patches/Linux-sparc-2.0.30.diff</a>.
This patch is against the Linux distribution <TT>`sparclinux-2.0.30.tar.gz'</TT>
that is available at <CODE>vger.rutgers.edu</CODE> (a version of Linux that was
never merged with the official 2.0.30).  You must also install LinuxThreads
Version 0.6 or newer.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-Alpha" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-Alpha">2.6.1.4  Linux Alpha Notes</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL Version 3.23.12 is the first MySQL version that is
tested on Linux-Alpha.  If you plan to use MySQL on Linux-Alpha,
you should ensure that you have this version or newer.

</P>
<P>
We have tested MySQL on Alpha with our benchmarks and test suite,
and it appears to work nicely. 

</P>
<P>
We currently build the MySQL binary packages on SuSE Linux 7.0 for AXP,
kernel 2.4.4-SMP, Compaq C compiler (V6.2-505) and Compaq C++ compiler
(V6.3-006) on a Compaq DS20 machine with an Alpha EV6 processor.

</P>
<P>
You can find the above compilers at
<a HREF="http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/">http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/</a>).  By using these compilers,
instead of gcc, we get about 9-14% better performance with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Note that until MySQL version 3.23.52 and 4.0.2 we optimised the binary for
the current CPU only (by using the <CODE>-fast</CODE> compile option); this meant
that you could only use our binaries if you had an Alpha EV6 processor.

</P>
<P>
Starting with all following releases we added the <CODE>-arch generic</CODE> flag
to our compile options, which makes sure the binary runs on all Alpha
processors. We also compile statically to avoid library problems.

</P>

<PRE>
CC=ccc CFLAGS="-fast -arch generic" CXX=cxx \
CXXFLAGS="-fast -arch generic -noexceptions -nortti" \

<P>
If you want to use egcs the following configure line worked for us:

</P>

<PRE>

CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
--disable-shared
</PRE>

<P>
Some known problems when running MySQL on Linux-Alpha:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Debugging threaded applications like MySQL will not work with
<CODE>gdb 4.18</CODE>.  You should download and use gdb 5.1 instead!

<LI>

If you try linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> statically when using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, the
resulting image will core dump at start.  In other words, <STRONG>don't</STRONG>
use <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-PowerPC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-PowerPC">2.6.1.5  Linux PowerPC Notes</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL should work on MkLinux with the newest <CODE>glibc</CODE> package
(tested with <CODE>glibc</CODE> 2.0.7).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-MIPS" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-MIPS">2.6.1.6  Linux MIPS Notes</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to work on Qube2, (Linux Mips), you need the
newest <CODE>glibc</CODE> libraries (<CODE>glibc-2.0.7-29C2</CODE> is known to
work).  You must also use the <CODE>egcs</CODE> C++ compiler
(<CODE>egcs-1.0.2-9</CODE>, <CODE>gcc 2.95.2</CODE> or newer).

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Linux-IA64" HREF="manual_toc.html#Linux-IA64">2.6.1.7  Linux IA64 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to compile on Linux IA64, we use the following compile line:
Using <CODE>gcc-2.96</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors \
-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
"--with-comment=Official MySQL binary" --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
On IA64 the MySQL client binaries are using shared libraries. This means
that if you install our binary distribution in some other place than
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> you need to either modify <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT>
or add the path to the directory where you have <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT>
to the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Link_errors">A.3.1  Problems When Linking with the MySQL Client Library</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Windows" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows">2.6.2  Windows Notes</A></H3>

<P>
This section describes using MySQL on Windows. This information
is also provided in the <TT>`README'</TT> file that comes with the
MySQL Windows distribution. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_installation">2.1.2  Installing MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Win95_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#Win95_start">2.6.2.1  Starting MySQL on Windows 95, 98 or Me</A></H4>

<P>
MySQL uses TCP/IP to connect a client to a server. (This will
allow any machine on your network to connect to your MySQL
server.)  Because of this, you must install TCP/IP on your
machine before starting MySQL.  You can find TCP/IP on your
Windows CD-ROM.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using an old Windows 95 release (for example
OSR2), it's likely that you have an old Winsock package;
MySQL requires Winsock 2! You can get the newest Winsock from
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</a>.  Windows 98 has the new Winsock 2
library, so the above doesn't apply there.

</P>
<P>
To start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server, you should start an MS-DOS
window and type:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld
</PRE>

<P>
This will start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the background without a window.

</P>
<P>
You can kill the MySQL server by executing:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
This calls the MySQL administation utility as user `root', which
is the default Administrator in the MySQL grant system. Please
note that the MySQL grant system is wholly independent from any
login users under Windows.

</P>
<P>
Note that Windows 95/98/Me don't support creation of named pipes.
So on those platforms, you can only use named pipes to connect to a
remote MySQL server running on a Windows NT/2000/XP server host.
(The MySQL server must also support named pipes, of course.
For example, using <CODE>mysqld-opt</CODE> under NT/2000/XP will not
allow named pipe connections.  You should use either
<CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't start, please check the
<TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> file to see if the server wrote any
message there to indicate the cause of the problem.  You can also
try to start the server with <CODE>mysqld --standalone</CODE>; in this
case, you may get some useful information on the screen that may
help solve the problem.

</P>
<P>
The last option is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--standalone --debug</CODE>.
In this case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a log file
<TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> that should contain the reason why
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't start. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
Use <CODE>mysqld --help</CODE> to display all the options that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> understands!

</P>



<H4><A NAME="NT_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#NT_start">2.6.2.2  Starting MySQL on Windows NT, 2000 or XP</A></H4>

<P>
To get MySQL to work with TCP/IP on Windows NT 4, you must install
service pack 3 (or newer)!

</P>
<P>
Normally you should install MySQL as a service on Windows NT/2000/XP.
In case the server was already running, first stop it using
the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqladmin -u root shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
This calls the MySQL administation utility as user `<CODE>root</CODE>',
which is the default <CODE>Administrator</CODE> in the MySQL grant system.
Please note that the MySQL grant system is wholly independent from
any login users under Windows.

</P>
<P>
Now install the server service:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqld-max-nt --install
</PRE>

<P>
If any options are required, they must be specified as
``<CODE>Start parameters</CODE>'' in the Windows <CODE>Services</CODE>
utility before you start the MySQL service.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>Services</CODE> utility
(<CODE>Windows Service Control Manager</CODE>) can be found in the
<CODE>Windows Control Panel</CODE> (under <CODE>Administrative Tools</CODE>
on Windows 2000). It is advisable to close the Services utility
while performing the <CODE>--install</CODE> or <CODE>--remove</CODE>
operations, this prevents some odd errors.

</P>
<P>
For information about which server binary to run, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_prepare_environment">2.1.2.2  Preparing the Windows MySQL Environment</A>.

</P>
<P>
Please note that from MySQL version 3.23.44, you have the choice
of set up the service as <CODE>Manual</CODE> instead (if you don't wish
the service to be started automatically during the boot process):

</P>

<PRE>
C:\mysql\bin&#62; mysqld-max-nt --install-manual
</PRE>

<P>
The service is installed with the name <CODE>MySQL</CODE>. Once
installed, it can be immediately started from the <CODE>Services</CODE>
utility, or by using the command <CODE>NET START MySQL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Once running, <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> can be stopped using
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, from the Services utility, or by using the
command <CODE>NET STOP MySQL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When running as a service, the operating system will automatically stop
the MySQL service on computer shutdown. In MySQL versions &#60; 3.23.47,
Windows only waited for a few seconds for the shutdown to complete, and
killed the database server process if the time limit was exceeded
(potentially causing problems). For instance, at the next startup the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> storage engine had to do crash recovery. Starting from
MySQL version 3.23.48, the Windows will wait longer for the MySQL server
shutdown to complete. If you notice this is not enough for your
intallation, it is safest to run the MySQL server not as a service, but
from the Command prompt, and shut it down with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There is a problem that Windows NT (but not Windows 2000/XP) by default only
waits 20 seconds for a service to shut down, and after that kills the
service process. You can increase this default by opening the Registry
Editor <TT>`\winnt\system32\regedt32.exe'</TT> and editing the value of
<CODE>WaitToKillServiceTimeout</CODE> at
<TT>`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control'</TT>
in the Registry tree. Specify the new larger value in milliseconds,
for example 120000 to have Windows NT wait upto 120 seconds.

</P>
<P>
Please note that when run as a service, <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE>
has no access to a console and so no messages can be seen.
Errors can be checked in <TT>`c:\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems installing <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> as a
service, try starting it with the full path:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max-nt --install
</PRE>

<P>
If this doesn't work, you can get <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> to
start properly by fixing the path in the registry!

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to start <CODE>mysqld-max-nt</CODE> as a service,
you can start it as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld-max-nt --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --standalone --debug
</PRE>

<P>
The last method gives you a debug trace in
<TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

MySQL supports TCP/IP on all Windows platforms and named pipes on
NT/2000/XP. The default is to use named pipes for local connections
on NT/2000/XP and TCP/IP for all other cases if the client has TCP/IP
installed. The host name specifies which protocol is used:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Host name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Protocol</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>NULL (none) </TD><TD>

On 9x/Me, TCP/IP is used.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>. </TD><TD> Named pipes
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>localhost </TD><TD>
TCP/IP to current host
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>hostname </TD><TD>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You can force a MySQL client to use named pipes by specifying the
<CODE>--pipe</CODE> option or by specifying <CODE>.</CODE> as the host name.  Use the
<CODE>--socket</CODE> option to specify the name of the pipe.
In MySQL 4.1 you should use the <CODE>--protocol=PIPE</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Note that starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if mysqld is
started with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.  This is because some users
have experienced problems shutting down the MySQL server when one uses
named pipes.

</P>
<P>
You can test whether MySQL is working by executing the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqlshow -u root mysql
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin version status proc
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql test
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is slow to answer to connections on Windows 9x/Me, there is
probably a problem with your DNS.  In this case, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> and use only <CODE>localhost</CODE> and IP numbers in
the MySQL grant tables.  You can also avoid DNS when connecting to a
<CODE>mysqld-nt</CODE> MySQL server running on NT/2000/XP by using the
<CODE>--pipe</CODE> argument to specify use of named pipes.  This works for most
MySQL clients.

</P>
<P>
There are two versions of the MySQL command-line tool:
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Binary</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled on native Windows, which offers very limited text editing capabilities.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysqlc</CODE> </TD><TD> Compiled with the Cygnus GNU compiler and libraries, which offers <CODE>readline</CODE> editing.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
If you want to use <CODE>mysqlc.exe</CODE>, you must copy
<TT>`C:\mysql\lib\cygwinb19.dll'</TT> to your Windows system directory
(<TT>`\windows\system'</TT> or similar place).

</P>
<P>
The default privileges on Windows give all local users full privileges
to all databases without specifying a password.  To make MySQL
more secure, you should set a password for all users and remove the row in
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table that has <CODE>Host='localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User=''</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also add a password for the <CODE>root</CODE> user. The following
example starts by removing the anonymous user that has all privileges,
then sets a <CODE>root</CODE> user password:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysql mysql
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
mysql&#62; QUIT
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin reload
C:\&#62; C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root password your_password
</PRE>

<P>
After you've set the password, if you want to take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, you can do so using this command:

</P>

<PRE>
C:\&#62; mysqladmin --user=root --password=your_password shutdown
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using the old shareware version of MySQL Version
3.21 under Windows, the above command will fail with an error:
<CODE>parse error near 'SET password'</CODE>.  The solution for
this is to download and upgrade to the latest MySQL version,
which is now freely available.

</P>
<P>
With the current MySQL versions you can easily add new users
and change privileges with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.

Here is a note about how to connect to get a secure connection to remote
MySQL server with SSH (by David Carlson <a HREF="mailto:dcarlson@mplcomm.com">dcarlson@mplcomm.com</a>):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Install an SSH client on your Windows machine.  As a user, the best non-free
one I've found is from <CODE>SecureCRT</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.vandyke.com/">http://www.vandyke.com/</a>.
Another option is <CODE>f-secure</CODE> from <a HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/">http://www.f-secure.com/</a>. You
can also find some free ones on <CODE>Google</CODE> at
<a HREF="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/">http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/SSH/Clients/Windows/</a>.

<LI>

Start your Windows SSH client.
Set <CODE>Host_Name = yourmysqlserver_URL_or_IP</CODE>.
Set <CODE>userid=your_userid</CODE> to log in to your server (probably not the same
as your MySQL login/password.

<LI>

Set up port forwarding. Either do a remote forward (Set <CODE>local_port: 3306</CODE>, <CODE>remote_host: yourmysqlservername_or_ip</CODE>, <CODE>remote_port: 3306</CODE> )
or a local forward (Set <CODE>port: 3306</CODE>,  <CODE>host: localhost</CODE>, <CODE>remote port: 3306</CODE>).

<LI>

Save everything, otherwise you'll have to redo it the next time.

<LI>

Log in to your server with SSH session you just created.

<LI>

On your Windows machine, start some ODBC application (such as Access).

<LI>

Create a new file in Windows and link to MySQL using the ODBC
driver the same way you normally do, except type in <CODE>localhost</CODE>
for the MySQL host server@-not <CODE>yourmysqlservername</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
You should now have an ODBC connection to MySQL, encrypted using SSH.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<A NAME="IDX332"></A>

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL Version 3.23.16, the <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>
and <CODE>mysql-max-nt</CODE> servers in the MySQL distribution are
compiled with the <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE> option.  This allows you to put a
database on different disk by adding a symbolic link to it
(in a manner similar to the way that symbolic links work on Unix).

</P>
<P>
On Windows, you make a symbolic link to a database by creating a file
that contains the path to the destination directory and saving this in
the <TT>`mysql_data'</TT> directory under the filename <TT>`database.sym'</TT>.
Note that the symbolic link will be used only if the directory
<TT>`mysql_data_dir\database'</TT> doesn't exist.

</P>
<P>
For example, if the MySQL data directory is <TT>`C:\mysql\data'</TT>
and you want to have database <CODE>foo</CODE> located at <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>, you
should create the file <TT>`C:\mysql\data\foo.sym'</TT> that contains the
text <CODE>D:\data\foo\</CODE>.  After that, all tables created in the database
<CODE>foo</CODE> will be created in <TT>`D:\data\foo'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Note that because of the speed penalty you get when opening every table,
we have not enabled this by default even if you have compiled
MySQL with support for this. To enable symlinks you should put
in your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file the following entry:

</P>

<PRE>
[mysqld]
use-symbolic-links
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL 4.0 we will enable symlinks by default. Then you
should instead use the <CODE>skip-symlink</CODE> option if you want to
disable this.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>

</P>
<P>
In your source files, you should include <TT>`windows.h'</TT> before you include
<TT>`mysql.h'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
#include &#60;windows.h&#62;

#include &#60;mysql.h&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
You can either link your code with the dynamic <TT>`libmysql.lib'</TT> library,
which is just a wrapper to load in <TT>`libmysql.dll'</TT> on demand, or link
with the static <TT>`mysqlclient.lib'</TT> library.

</P>
<P>
Note that as the mysqlclient libraries are compiled as threaded libraries,
you should also compile your code to be multi-threaded!

<H4><A NAME="Windows_vs_Unix" HREF="manual_toc.html#Windows_vs_Unix">2.6.2.7  MySQL-Windows Compared to Unix MySQL</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<A NAME="IDX336"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL-Windows has by now proven itself to be very stable. This version
of MySQL has the same features as the corresponding Unix version
with the following exceptions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Windows 95 and threads</STRONG>
<DD>
Windows 95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread creation.
Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you shouldn't
run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> for an extended time on Windows 95 if your server handles
many connections!  Other versions of Windows don't suffer from this bug.

<DT><STRONG>Concurrent reads</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL depends on the <CODE>pread()</CODE> and <CODE>pwrite()</CODE> calls to be
able to mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  Currently we use mutexes
to emulate <CODE>pread()</CODE>/<CODE>pwrite()</CODE>.  We will, in the long run,
replace the file level interface with a virtual interface so that we can
use the <CODE>readfile()</CODE>/<CODE>writefile()</CODE> interface on NT/2000/XP to
get more speed.
The current implementation limits the number of open files MySQL
can use to 1024, which means that you will not be able to run as many
concurrent threads on NT/2000/XP as on Unix.

<DT><STRONG>Blocking read</STRONG>
<DD>
MySQL uses a blocking read for each connection.
This means that:


<UL>
<LI>

A connection will not be disconnected automatically after 8 hours, as happens
with the Unix version of MySQL.

<LI>

If a connection hangs, it's impossible to break it without killing
MySQL.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> will not work on a sleeping connection.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> can't abort as long as there are sleeping
connections.
</UL>

We plan to fix this problem when our Windows developers have figured out a
nice workaround.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
You can't drop a database that is in use by some thread.

<DT><STRONG>Killing MySQL from the task manager</STRONG>
<DD>
You can't kill MySQL from the task manager or with the shutdown
utility in Windows 95.  You must take it down with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>Case-insensitive names</STRONG>
<DD>
Filenames are case-insensitive on Windows, so database and table names
are also case-insensitive in MySQL for Windows.  The only
restriction is that database and table names must be specified using the same
case throughout a given statement.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<DT><STRONG>The <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> directory character</STRONG>
<DD>
Pathname components in Windows 95 are separated by the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character,
which is also the escape character in MySQL.  If you are using <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> or <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, you must double the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>
character:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:\\tmp\\skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\tmp\\skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

Alternatively, use Unix style filenames with <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> characters:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/tmp/skr.txt" INTO TABLE skr;
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/skr.txt' FROM skr;
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Can't open named pipe</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you use a MySQL 3.22 version on NT with the newest mysql-clients
you will get the following error:


<PRE>
error 2017: can't open named pipe to host: . pipe...
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX337"></A>
This is because the release version of MySQL uses named pipes on NT
by default.  You can avoid this error by using the <CODE>--host=localhost</CODE>
option to the new MySQL clients or create an option file
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> that contains the following information:


<PRE>
[client]
host = localhost
</PRE>

Starting from 3.23.50, named pipes are only enabled if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is started
with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Access denied for user</CODE> error</STRONG>
<DD>
If you get the error <CODE>Access denied for user: 'some-user@unknown'
to database 'mysql'</CODE> when accessing a MySQL server on the same
machine, this means that MySQL can't resolve your host name
properly.

To fix this, you should create a file <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> with the
following information:


<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost
</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>
While you are executing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement, the table is locked
from usage by other threads.  This has to do with the fact that on Windows,
you can't delete a file that is in use by another threads.  (In the future,
we may find some way to work around this problem.)

<DT><STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>
<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is in use by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table will
not work on Windows because the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> handler does the table mapping
hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow you
to drop files that are open, you first must flush all <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables (with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>) or drop the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
<CODE>VIEW</CODE>s.
<DT><STRONG></STRONG>
<DD>
<CODE>DATA DIRECTORY</CODE> and <CODE>INDEX DIRECTORY</CODE> directives in
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> is ignored on Windows, because Windows doesn't support
symbolic links.
</DL>

<P>
Here are some open issues for anyone who might want to help us with the Windows
release:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX338"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make a single-user <CODE>MYSQL.DLL</CODE> server.  This should include everything in
a standard MySQL server, except thread creation.  This will make
MySQL much easier to use in applications that don't need a true
client/server and don't need to access the server from other hosts.

<LI>

Add some nice start and shutdown icons to the MySQL installation.

<LI>

When registering <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service with <CODE>--install</CODE> (on NT)
it would be nice if you could also add default options on the command-line.
For the moment, the workaround is to list the parameters in the
<TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file instead.

<LI>

It would be really nice to be able to kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from the task manager.
For the moment, you must use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

<LI>

Port <CODE>readline</CODE> to Windows for use in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tool.

<LI>

GUI versions of the standard MySQL clients (<CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>) would be nice.

<LI>

It would be nice if the socket read and write functions in <TT>`net.c'</TT> were
interruptible. This would make it possible to kill open threads with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> on Windows.

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> always starts in the "C" locale and not in the default locale.
We would like to have <CODE>mysqld</CODE> use the current locale for the sort order.

<LI>

Add macros to use the faster thread-safe increment/decrement methods
provided by Windows.
</UL>

<P>
Other Windows-specific issues are described in the <TT>`README'</TT> file that
comes with the MySQL-Windows distribution.

<P>
On Solaris, you may run into trouble even before you get the MySQL
distribution unpacked!  Solaris <CODE>tar</CODE> can't handle long file names, so
you may see an error like this when you unpack MySQL:

</P>

<PRE>
x mysql-3.22.12-beta/bench/Results/ATIS-mysql_odbc-NT_4.0-cmp-db2,\
informix,ms-sql,mysql,oracle,solid,sybase, 0 bytes, 0 tape blocks
tar: directory checksum error
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, you must use GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> (<CODE>gtar</CODE>) to unpack the
distribution.  You can find a precompiled copy for Solaris at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/os-solaris.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
Sun native threads work only on Solaris 2.5 and higher.  For Version 2.4 and
earlier, MySQL will automatically use MIT-pthreads.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error from configure:

</P>

<PRE>
checking for restartable system calls... configure: error can not run test
programs while cross compiling
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you have something wrong with your compiler installation!
In this case you should upgrade your compiler to a newer version.  You may
also be able to solve this problem by inserting the following row into the
<TT>`config.cache'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls=${ac_cv_sys_restartable_syscalls='no'}
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using Solaris on a SPARC, the recommended compiler is
<CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.  You can find this at <a HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">http://gcc.gnu.org/</a>.
Note that <CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.1 and <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.8.1 don't work reliably on
SPARC!

</P>
<P>
The recommended <CODE>configure</CODE> line when using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O3 -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
If you have an UltraSPARC, you can get 4% more performance by adding
"-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa" to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

</P>
<P>
If you have Sun's Forte 5.0 (or newer) compiler, you can
run <CODE>configure</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
You can create a 64 bit binary with:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=cc CFLAGS="-Xa -fast -native -xstrconst -mt -xarch=v9" \
CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-noex -mt -xarch=v9" ASFLAGS="-xarch=v9" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
</PRE>

<P>
In the MySQL benchmarks, we got a 4% speedup on an UltraSPARC when using
Forte 5.0 in 32 bit mode compared to using gcc 3.2 with -mcpu flags.

</P>
<P>
If you create a 64 bit binary, it's 4 % slower than the 32 bit binary, but
mysqld can instead handle more treads and memory.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> or <CODE>sched_yield</CODE>,
you can fix this by adding <CODE>LIBS=-lrt</CODE> to the configure line

</P>
<P>
The following paragraph is only relevant for older compilers than
WorkShop 5.3:

</P>
<P>
You may also have to edit the <CODE>configure</CODE> script to change this line:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__) || __STDC__ != 1
</PRE>

<P>
to this:

</P>

<PRE>
#if !defined(__STDC__)
</PRE>

<P>
If you turn on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> with the <CODE>-Xc</CODE> option, the Sun compiler
can't compile with the Solaris <TT>`pthread.h'</TT> header file.  This is a Sun
bug (broken compiler or broken include file).

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> issues the error message shown here when you run it, you have
tried to compile MySQL with the Sun compiler without enabling the
multi-thread option (<CODE>-mt</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
libc internal error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-mt</CODE> to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> and try again.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the SFW version of gcc (which comes with Solaris 8),
you must add <TT>`/opt/sfw/lib'</TT> to the environment variable
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> before running configure.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the gcc available from <CODE>sunfreeware.com</CODE>, you may
have many problems.  You should recompile gcc and GNU binutils on the
machine you will be running them from to avoid any problems.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error when compiling MySQL with <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
it means that your <CODE>gcc</CODE> is not configured for your version of Solaris:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -O3 -g -O2 -DDBUG_OFF  -o thr_alarm ...
./thr_alarm.c: In function `signal_hand':
./thr_alarm.c:556: too many arguments to function `sigwait'
</PRE>

<P>
The proper thing to do in this case is to get the newest version of
<CODE>gcc</CODE> and compile it with your current <CODE>gcc</CODE> compiler!  At
least for Solaris 2.5, almost all binary versions of <CODE>gcc</CODE> have
old, unusable include files that will break all programs that use
threads (and possibly other programs)!

</P>
<P>
Solaris doesn't provide static versions of all system libraries
(<CODE>libpthreads</CODE> and <CODE>libdl</CODE>), so you can't compile MySQL
with <CODE>--static</CODE>.  If you try to do so, you will get the error:

</P>

<PRE>
ld: fatal: library -ldl: not found

or

undefined reference to `dlopen'

or

cannot find -lrt
</PRE>

<P>
If too many processes try to connect very rapidly to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you will
see this error in the MySQL log:

</P>

<PRE>
Error in accept: Protocol error
</PRE>

<P>
You might try starting the server with the <CODE>--set-variable back_log=50</CODE>
option as a workaround for this. Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is
deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--back_log=50</CODE> on its own.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are linking your own MySQL client, you might get the
following error when you try to execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
ld.so.1: ./my: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.#:
open failed: No such file or directory
</PRE>

<P>
The problem can be avoided by one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Link the client with the following flag (instead of <CODE>-Lpath</CODE>):
<CODE>-Wl,r/full-path-to-libmysqlclient.so</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`libmysqclient.so'</TT> to <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX344"></A>
<A NAME="IDX345"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable before running your client.
</UL>

<P>
If you have problems with configure trying to link with <CODE>-lz</CODE> and
you don't have <CODE>zlib</CODE> installed, you have two options:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to be able to use the compressed communication protocol,
you need to get and install zlib from ftp.gnu.org.

<LI>

Configure with <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using gcc and have problems with loading <CODE>UDF</CODE> functions
into MySQL, try adding <CODE>-lgcc</CODE> to the link line for the
<CODE>UDF</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
If you would like MySQL to start automatically, you can copy
<TT>`support-files/mysql.server'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and create a
symbolic link to it named <TT>`/etc/rc3.d/S99mysql.server'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
As Solaris doesn't support core files for <CODE>setuid()</CODE> applications,
you can't get a core file from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> if you are using the
<CODE>--user</CODE> option.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_2.7" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_2.7">2.6.3.1  Solaris 2.7/2.8 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
You can normally use a Solaris 2.6 binary on Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.  Most
of the Solaris 2.6 issues also apply for Solaris 2.7 and 2.8.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL Version 3.23.4 and above should be able to autodetect
new versions of Solaris and enable workarounds for the following problems!

</P>
<P>
Solaris 2.7 / 2.8 has some bugs in the include files.  You may see the
following error when you use <CODE>gcc</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/include/widec.h:42: warning: `getwc' redefined
/usr/include/wchar.h:326: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition
</PRE>

<P>
If this occurs, you can do the following to fix the problem:

</P>
<P>
Copy <CODE>/usr/include/widec.h</CODE> to
<CODE>.../lib/gcc-lib/os/gcc-version/include</CODE> and change line 41 from:

</P>

<PRE>
#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint)

to

#if     !defined(lint) &#38;& !defined(__lint) &#38;& !defined(getwc)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, you can edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> directly.  Either
way, after you make the fix, you should remove <TT>`config.cache'</TT> and run
<CODE>configure</CODE> again!

</P>
<P>
If you get errors like this when you run <CODE>make</CODE>, it's because
<CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect the <TT>`curses.h'</TT> file (probably
because of the error in <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
In file included from mysql.cc:50:
/usr/include/term.h:1060: syntax error before `,'
/usr/include/term.h:1081: syntax error before `;'
</PRE>

<P>
The solution to this is to do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Configure with <CODE>CFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H CXXFLAGS=-DHAVE_CURSES_H ./configure</CODE>.

<LI>

Edit <TT>`/usr/include/widec.h'</TT> as indicted above and rerun configure.

<LI>

Remove the <CODE>#define HAVE_TERM</CODE> line from <TT>`config.h'</TT> file and
run <CODE>make</CODE> again.
</UL>

<P>
If you get a problem that your linker can't find <CODE>-lz</CODE> when linking
your client program, the problem is probably that your <TT>`libz.so'</TT> file is
installed in <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>.  You can fix this by one of the
following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Add <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT> to <CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>.

<LI>

Add a link to <TT>`libz.so'</TT> from <TT>`/lib'</TT>.

<LI>

If you are using Solaris 8, you can install the optional zlib from your
Solaris 8 CD distribution.

<LI>

Configure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-named-z-libs=no</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Solaris_x86" HREF="manual_toc.html#Solaris_x86">2.6.3.2  Solaris x86 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
On Solaris 2.8 on x86, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will core dump if you run
'strip' in.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> on Solaris x86 and you
experience problems with core dumps under load, you should use the
following <CODE>configure</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
CXX=gcc \
CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -felide-constructors -fno-exceptions \
-fno-rtti -DHAVE_CURSES_H" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions.

</P>
<P>
If this doesn't help, you should compile a debug version and run
it with a trace file or under <CODE>gdb</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">E.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

<P>
This section provides information for the various BSD flavours,
as well as specific versions within those.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="FreeBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#FreeBSD">2.6.4.1  FreeBSD Notes</A></H4>

<P>
FreeBSD 3.x is recommended for running MySQL since the thread package
is much more integrated.

</P>
<P>
The easiest and therefore the preferred way to install is to use the
mysql-server and mysql-client ports available on
<a HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">http://www.freebsd.org/</a>.

</P>
<P>
Using these gives you:

<UL>
<LI>

A working MySQL with all optimisations known to work on your version
of FreeBSD enabled.

<LI>

Automatic configuration and build.

<LI>

Startup scripts installed in /usr/local/etc/rc.d.

<LI>

Ability to see which files that are installed with pkg_info -L. And to
remove them all with pkg_delete if you no longer want MySQL on that
machine.
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended you use MIT-pthreads on FreeBSD 2.x and native threads on
Versions 3 and up. It is possible to run with  native threads on some late
2.2.x versions but you may encounter problems shutting down <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL <TT>`Makefile'</TT>s require GNU make (<CODE>gmake</CODE>) to work.  If
you want to compile MySQL you need to install GNU <CODE>make</CODE> first.

</P>
<P>
Be sure to have your name resolver setup correct.  Otherwise, you may
experience resolver delays or failures when connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Make sure that the <CODE>localhost</CODE> entry in the <TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file is
correct (otherwise, you will have problems connecting to the database).  The
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> file should start with a line:

</P>

<PRE>
127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.your.domain
</PRE>

<P>
The recommended way to compile and install MySQL on FreeBSD with
gcc (2.95.2 and up) is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-strength-reduce" \
CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -felide-constructors \
-fno-strength-reduce" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --enable-assembler
gmake
gmake install
./scripts/mysql_install_db
cd /usr/local/mysql
./bin/mysqld_safe &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you notice that <CODE>configure</CODE> will use MIT-pthreads, you should read
the MIT-pthreads notes.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MIT-pthreads">2.3.6  MIT-pthreads Notes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you get an error from <CODE>make install</CODE> that it can't find
<TT>`/usr/include/pthreads'</TT>, <CODE>configure</CODE> didn't detect that you need
MIT-pthreads.  This is fixed by executing these commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; rm config.cache
shell&#62; ./configure --with-mit-threads
</PRE>

<P>
FreeBSD is also known to have a very low default file handle limit.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Not_enough_file_handles">A.2.16  File Not Found</A>.  Uncomment the ulimit -n section in
safe_mysqld or raise the limits for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> user in /etc/login.conf
(and rebuild it with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf).  Also be sure you set the
appropriate class for this user in the password file if you are not
using the default (use: chpass mysqld-user-name).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of memory you should consider rebuilding
the kernel to allow MySQL to take more than 512M of RAM.
Take a look at <CODE>option MAXDSIZ</CODE> in the LINT config
file for more info.

</P>
<P>
If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
<CODE>TZ</CODE> variable will probably help.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get a secure and stable system you should only use FreeBSD kernels
that are marked <CODE>-RELEASE</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="NetBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#NetBSD">2.6.4.2  NetBSD notes</A></H4>

<P>
To compile on NetBSD you need GNU <CODE>make</CODE>. Otherwise, the compile will
crash when <CODE>make</CODE> tries to run <CODE>lint</CODE> on C++ files.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="OpenBSD" HREF="manual_toc.html#OpenBSD">2.6.4.3  OpenBSD 2.5 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
On OpenBSD Version 2.5, you can compile MySQL with native threads
with the following options:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS=-pthread CXXFLAGS=-pthread ./configure --with-mit-threads=no
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="OpenBSD_2.8" HREF="manual_toc.html#OpenBSD_2.8">2.6.4.4  OpenBSD 2.8 Notes</A></H4>

<P>
Our users have reported that OpenBSD 2.8 has a threading bug which causes
problems with MySQL.  The OpenBSD Developers have fixed the problem,
but as of January 25th, 2001, it's only available in the ``-current'' branch.
The symptoms of this threading bug are: slow response, high load, high CPU
usage, and crashes.

</P>
<P>
If you get an error like <CODE>Error in accept:: Bad file descriptor</CODE> or
error 9 when trying to open tables or directories, the problem is probably
that you haven't allocated enough file descriptors for MySQL.

</P>
<P>
In this case try starting <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as root with the following
options:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>--user=mysql --open-files-limit=2048</CODE>

</P>


<H4><A NAME="BSDI" HREF="manual_toc.html#BSDI">2.6.4.5  BSD/OS Version 2.x Notes</A></H4>

</P>

<PRE>
item_func.h: In method `Item_func_ge::Item_func_ge(const Item_func_ge &#38;)':

</PRE>

<P>
Try using <CODE>ulimit -v 80000</CODE> and run <CODE>make</CODE> again.  If this
doesn't work and you are using <CODE>bash</CODE>, try switching to <CODE>csh</CODE>
or <CODE>sh</CODE>; some BSDI users have reported problems with <CODE>bash</CODE>
and <CODE>ulimit</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE>, you may also use have to use the
<CODE>--with-low-memory</CODE> flag for <CODE>configure</CODE> to be able to compile
<TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you get problems with the current date in MySQL, setting the
<CODE>TZ</CODE> variable will probably help.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="BSDI3" HREF="manual_toc.html#BSDI3">2.6.4.6  BSD/OS Version 3.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
Upgrade to BSD/OS Version 3.1.  If that is not possible, install
BSDIpatch M300-038.

</P>
<P>
Use the following command when configuring MySQL:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; env CXX=shlicc++ CC=shlicc2 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \

           --without-perl \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
</PRE>

<P>
The following is also known to work:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; env CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
       ./configure \
           --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
           --with-unix-socket-path=/var/mysql/mysql.sock
</PRE>

<P>
You can change the directory locations if you wish, or just use the
defaults by not specifying any locations.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with performance under heavy load, try using the
<CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>!  This will run
all threads with the same priority; on BSDI Version 3.1, this gives better
performance (at least until BSDI fixes their thread scheduler).

</P>
<P>
If you get the error <CODE>virtual memory exhausted</CODE> while compiling,
you should try using <CODE>ulimit -v 80000</CODE> and run <CODE>make</CODE> again.
If this doesn't work and you are using <CODE>bash</CODE>, try switching to
<CODE>csh</CODE> or <CODE>sh</CODE>; some BSDI users have reported problems with
<CODE>bash</CODE> and <CODE>ulimit</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="BSDI4" HREF="manual_toc.html#BSDI4">2.6.4.7  BSD/OS Version 4.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
BSDI Version 4.x has some thread-related bugs.  If you want to use
MySQL on this, you should install all thread-related patches.  At
least M400-023 should be installed.

</P>
<P>
On some BSDI Version 4.x systems, you may get problems with shared libraries.
The symptom is that you can't execute any client programs, for example,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.  In this case you need to reconfigure not to use
shared libraries with the <CODE>--disable-shared</CODE> option to configure.

</P>
<P>
Some customers have had problems on BSDI 4.0.1 that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
binary after a while can't open tables.  This is because some
library/system related bug causes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to change current
directory without asking for this!

</P>
<P>
The fix is to either upgrade to 3.23.34 or after running <CODE>configure</CODE>
remove the line <CODE>#define HAVE_REALPATH</CODE> from <CODE>config.h</CODE>
before running make.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that you can't symbolic link a database directories
to another database directory or symbolic link a table to another database
on BSDI!  (Making a symbolic link to another disk is okay).

<P>
MySQL should work without any problems on Mac OS X 10.x 
(Darwin). You don't need the pthread patches for this OS!

</P>
<P>
This also applies to Mac OS X 10.x Server. Compiling for the Server platform
is the same as for the client version of Mac OS X. However please note that
MySQL comes preinstalled on the Server!

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Mac_OS_X_installation">2.1.3  Installing MySQL on Mac OS X</A>.

Before trying to configure MySQL on Mac OS X server you must
first install the pthread package from
<a HREF="http://www.prnet.de/RegEx/mysql.html">http://www.prnet.de/RegEx/mysql.html</a>.

</P>

<PRE>
alias mysql '/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql'

</P>
<P>
Some of the binary distributions of MySQL for HP-UX are
distributed as an HP depot file and as a tar file.  To use the depot
file you must be running at least HP-UX 10.x to have access to HP's
software depot tools.

</P>
<P>
The HP version of MySQL was compiled on an HP 9000/8xx server
under HP-UX 10.20, and uses MIT-pthreads.  It is known to work well under
this configuration.  MySQL Version 3.22.26 and newer can also be
built with HP's native thread package.

</P>
<P>
Other configurations that may work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20+
<LI>

HP 9000/8xx running HP-UX 10.30
</UL>

<P>
The following configurations almost definitely won't work:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 10.x where x &#60; 2
<LI>

HP 9000/7xx or 8xx running HP-UX 9.x
</UL>

<P>
To install the distribution, use one of the commands here, where
<CODE>/path/to/depot</CODE> is the full pathname of the depot file:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To install everything, including the server, client and development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.full
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.server
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the client package:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.client
</PRE>

<LI>

To install only the development tools:


<PRE>
shell&#62; /usr/sbin/swinstall -s /path/to/depot mysql.developer
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The depot places binaries and libraries in <TT>`/opt/mysql'</TT> and data in
<TT>`/var/opt/mysql'</TT>. The depot also creates the appropriate entries in
<TT>`/etc/init.d'</TT> and <TT>`/etc/rc2.d'</TT> to start the server automatically
at boot time.  Obviously, this entails being <CODE>root</CODE> to install.

</P>
<P>
To install the HP-UX tar.gz distribution, you must have a copy of GNU
<CODE>tar</CODE>.

<P>
There are a couple of small problems when compiling MySQL on
HP-UX.  We recommend that you use <CODE>gcc</CODE> instead of the HP-UX native
compiler, because <CODE>gcc</CODE> produces better code!

</P>
<P>
We recommend using gcc 2.95 on HP-UX.  Don't use high optimisation
flags (like -O6) as this may not be safe on HP-UX.

</P>
<P>
The following configure line should work with gcc 2.95:

</P>

<PRE>

<H4><A NAME="HP-UX_11.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#HP-UX_11.x">2.6.6.3  HP-UX Version 11.x Notes</A></H4>

<P>
For HP-UX Version 11.x we recommend MySQL Version 3.23.15 or later.

</P>
<P>
Because of some critical bugs in the standard HP-UX libraries, you should
install the following patches before trying to run MySQL on HP-UX 11.0:

</P>

<PRE>
PHKL_22840 Streams cumulative
PHNE_22397 ARPA cumulative
</PRE>

<P>
This will solve the problem of getting <CODE>EWOULDBLOCK</CODE> from <CODE>recv()</CODE>
and <CODE>EBADF</CODE> from <CODE>accept()</CODE> in threaded applications.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.1 on an unpatched HP-UX 11.x system,
you will get the error:

</P>

<PRE>

                 from item.cc:19:
</PRE>

<P>
The problem is that HP-UX doesn't define <CODE>pthreads_atfork()</CODE> consistently.
It has conflicting prototypes in
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT>:184 and
<TT>`/usr/include/sys/pthread.h'</TT>:440 (details below).

</P>
<P>
One solution is to copy <TT>`/usr/include/sys/unistd.h'</TT> into
<TT>`mysql/include'</TT> and edit <TT>`unistd.h'</TT> and change it to match
the definition in <TT>`pthread.h'</TT>.  Here's the diff:

<P>
Check that you don't have the path to the K&#38;R compiler before the path

<A NAME="IDX348"></A>

</P>
<P>
Automatic detection of <CODE>xlC</CODE> is missing from Autoconf, so a
<CODE>configure</CODE> command something like this is needed when compiling
MySQL (This example uses the IBM compiler):

</P>

<PRE>
export CC="xlc_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192 "
export CXX="xlC_r -ma -O3 -qstrict -qoptimize=3 -qmaxmem=8192"
export CFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L /usr/local/lib"
export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
		--localstatedir=/var/mysql \
		--sysconfdir=/etc/mysql \
		--sbindir='/usr/local/bin' \
		--libexecdir='/usr/local/bin' \
		--enable-thread-safe-client \
		--enable-large-files
</PRE>

<P>
Above are the options used to compile the MySQL distribution that
can be found at <a HREF="http://www-frec.bull.com/">http://www-frec.bull.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the <CODE>-O3</CODE> to <CODE>-O2</CODE> in the above configure line,
you must also remove the <CODE>-qstrict</CODE> option (this is a limitation in
the IBM C compiler).

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>gcc</CODE> or <CODE>egcs</CODE> to compile MySQL, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> use the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> flag, as the exception
handling in <CODE>gcc</CODE>/<CODE>egcs</CODE> is not thread-safe!  (This is tested with
<CODE>egcs</CODE> 1.1.)  There are also some known problems with IBM's assembler,
which may cause it to generate bad code when used with gcc.

</P>
<P>
We recommend the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line with <CODE>egcs</CODE> and
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE> on AIX:

</P>

<PRE>
CC="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXX="gcc -pipe -mcpu=power -Wa,-many" \
CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>-Wa,-many</CODE> is necessary for the compile to be successful.  IBM is
aware of this problem but is in to hurry to fix it because of the workaround
available.  We don't know if the <CODE>-fno-exceptions</CODE> is required with
<CODE>gcc 2.95</CODE>, but as MySQL doesn't use exceptions and the above
option generates faster code, we recommend that you should always use this
option with <CODE>egcs / gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with assembler code try changing the -mcpu=xxx to
match your CPU. Typically power2, power, or powerpc may need to be used,
alternatively you might need to use 604 or 604e. I'm not positive but I
would think using "power" would likely be safe most of the time, even on
a power2 machine.

</P>
<P>
If you don't know what your CPU is then do a "uname -m", this will give
you back a string that looks like "000514676700", with a format of
xxyyyyyymmss where xx and ss are always 0's, yyyyyy is a unique system
id and mm is the id of the CPU Planar. A chart of these values can be
found at
<a HREF="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds5/uname.htm</a>.
This will give you a machine type and a machine model you can use to
determine what type of CPU you have.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly
under high load) you may have found an OS bug with threads and
signals.  In this case you can tell MySQL not to use signals by
configuring with:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS=-DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM CXX=gcc \
       CXXFLAGS="-felide-constructors -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti \
       -DDONT_USE_THR_ALARM" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-debug --with-low-memory
</PRE>

<P>
This doesn't affect the performance of MySQL, but has the side
effect that you can't kill clients that are ``sleeping'' on a connection with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.  Instead, the client
will die when it issues its next command.

On some versions of AIX, linking with <CODE>libbind.a</CODE> makes
<CODE>getservbyname</CODE> core dump.  This is an AIX bug and should be reported
to IBM.

</P>
<P>
For AIX 4.2.1 and gcc you have to do the following changes.

</P>
<P>
After configuring, edit <TT>`config.h'</TT> and <TT>`include/my_config.h'</TT>
and change the line that says

</P>

<PRE>
#define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1
</PRE>

<P>
to

</P>

<PRE>
#undef HAVE_SNPRINTF
</PRE>

<P>
And finally, in <TT>`mysqld.cc'</TT> you need to add a prototype for initgoups.

</P>

<PRE>
#ifdef _AIX41

</PRE>

<P>
If you need to allocate a lot of memory to the mysqld process, it's not
enough to just set 'ulimit -d unlimited'. You may also have to set
in <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> something like:

<P>
On SunOS 4, MIT-pthreads is needed to compile MySQL, which in turn
means you will need GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Some SunOS 4 systems have problems with dynamic libraries and <CODE>libtool</CODE>.
You can use the following <CODE>configure</CODE> line to avoid this problem:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --disable-shared --with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static
</PRE>

<P>
When compiling <CODE>readline</CODE>, you may get warnings about duplicate defines.
These may be ignored.

<P>
If you are using egcs 1.1.2 on Digital Unix, you should upgrade to gcc
2.95.2, as egcs on DEC has some serious bugs!

</P>
<P>
When compiling threaded programs under Digital Unix, the documentation
recommends using the <CODE>-pthread</CODE> option for <CODE>cc</CODE> and <CODE>cxx</CODE> and
the libraries <CODE>-lmach -lexc</CODE> (in addition to <CODE>-lpthread</CODE>).  You
should run <CODE>configure</CODE> something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CC="cc -pthread" CXX="cxx -pthread -O" \
./configure --with-named-thread-libs="-lpthread -lmach -lexc -lc"

<P>
When compiling <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you may see a couple of warnings like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld.cc: In function void handle_connections()':
mysqld.cc:626: passing long unsigned int *' as argument 3 of
accept(int,sockadddr *, int *)'
</PRE>

<P>
You can safely ignore these warnings.  They occur because <CODE>configure</CODE>
can detect only errors, not warnings.

</P>
<P>
If you start the server directly from the command-line, you may have problems
with it dying when you log out.  (When you log out, your outstanding processes
receive a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal.)  If so, try starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; nohup mysqld [options] &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>nohup</CODE> causes the command following it to ignore any <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
signal sent from the terminal.  Alternatively, start the server by running
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, which invokes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> using <CODE>nohup</CODE> for you.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

If you get a problem when compiling mysys/get_opt.c, just remove the
line #define _NO_PROTO from the start of that file!

</P>

<P>
On OSF/1 V4.0D and compiler "DEC C V5.6-071 on Digital Unix V4.0 (Rev. 878)"
the compiler had some strange behaviour (undefined <CODE>asm</CODE> symbols).
<CODE>/bin/ld</CODE> also appears to be broken (problems with <CODE>_exit
undefined</CODE> errors occuring while linking <CODE>mysqld</CODE>).  On this system, we
have managed to compile MySQL with the following <CODE>configure</CODE>

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS=-O3 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql

In some versions of OSF/1, the <CODE>alloca()</CODE> function is broken. Fix
this by removing the line in <TT>`config.h'</TT> that defines <CODE>'HAVE_ALLOCA'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>alloca()</CODE> function also may have an incorrect prototype in
<CODE>/usr/include/alloca.h</CODE>.  This warning resulting from this can be ignored.

<P>
If you have problems with signals (MySQL dies unexpectedly

<P>
To fix this you should change to the <CODE>sql</CODE> directory and do a ``cut

For the moment the recommended compiler on OpenServer is gcc 2.95.2.  With this
you should be able to compile MySQL with just:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CXX=gcc ./configure ... (options)
</PRE>


<OL>
<LI>

For OpenServer 5.0.X you need to use gcc-2.95.2p1 or newer from the
Skunkware.  <a HREF="http://www.caldera.com/skunkware/">http://www.caldera.com/skunkware/</a> and choose browser
OpenServer packages or by ftp to ftp2.caldera.com in the
pub/skunkware/osr5/devtools/gcc directory.

<LI>

You need the port of GCC 2.5.x for this product and the Development
system.  They are required on this version of Caldera (SCO) Unix.  You cannot
just use the GCC Dev system.

<LI>

You should get the FSU Pthreads package and install it first.  This can be
found at
<a HREF="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/FSU-threads.tar.gz">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE_wrappers/FSU-threads.tar.gz</a>.

<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/FSU-threads-3.5c.tar.gz</a>.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads can be compiled with Caldera (SCO) Unix 4.2 with tcpip.  Or
OpenServer 3.0 or Open Desktop 3.0 (OS 3.0 ODT 3.0), with the Caldera (SCO)
Development System installed using a good port of GCC 2.5.x ODT or OS
3.0 you will need a good port of GCC 2.5.x There are a lot of problems
without a good port.  The port for this product requires the SCO Unix
Development system.  Without it, you are missing the libraries and the
linker that is needed.

<LI>

To build FSU Pthreads on your system, do the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Run <CODE>./configure</CODE> in the <TT>`threads/src'</TT> directory and select
the SCO OpenServer option. This command copies <TT>`Makefile.SCO5'</TT> to
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>.

<LI>

Run <CODE>make</CODE>.

<LI>

To install in the default <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> directory, login as root,
then <CODE>cd</CODE> to the <TT>`thread/src'</TT> directory, and run <CODE>make
install</CODE>.
</OL>

<LI>

Remember to use GNU <CODE>make</CODE> when making MySQL.

<LI>

If you don't start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as root, you probably will get only the
default 110 open files per process.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will write a note about this
in the log file.

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V5.0.5, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
You should also use gcc 2.95.2 or newer!

The following <CODE>configure</CODE> command should work:


<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --disable-shared
</PRE>

<LI>

With SCO 3.2V4.2, you should use FSU Pthreads version 3.5c or newer.
The following <CODE>configure</CODE> command should work:


<PRE>
shell&#62; CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_XPG4" \
       ./configure \

You may get some problems with some include files. In this case, you can
find new SCO-specific include files at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/SCO-3.2v4.2-includes.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/SCO/SCO-3.2v4.2-includes.tar.gz</a>.
You should unpack this file in the <TT>`include'</TT> directory of your
MySQL source tree.

Caldera (SCO) development notes:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL should automatically detect FSU Pthreads and link <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
with <CODE>-lgthreads -lsocket -lgthreads</CODE>.

<LI>

The Caldera (SCO) development libraries are re-entrant in FSU Pthreads.
Caldera claim sthat its libraries' functions are re-entrant, so they must
be reentrant with FSU Pthreads.  FSU Pthreads on OpenServer tries to use
the SCO scheme to make re-entrant libraries.

<LI>

FSU Pthreads (at least the version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>) comes
linked with GNU <CODE>malloc</CODE>.  If you encounter problems with memory usage,
make sure that <TT>`gmalloc.o'</TT> is included in <TT>`libgthreads.a'</TT> and
<TT>`libgthreads.so'</TT>.

<LI>

In FSU Pthreads, the following system calls are pthreads-aware: <CODE>read()</CODE>,
<CODE>write()</CODE>, <CODE>getmsg()</CODE>, <CODE>connect()</CODE>, <CODE>accept()</CODE>,
<CODE>select()</CODE>, and <CODE>wait()</CODE>.

<LI>

The CSSA-2001-SCO.35.2 (the patch is listed in custom as
erg711905-dscr_remap security patch (version 2.0.0) breaks FSU threads and
makes mysqld unstable.  You have to remove this one if you want to run
mysqld on an OpenServer 5.0.6 machine.

When using MySQL with OS/2 Warp 3, FixPack 29 or above is
required.  With OS/2 Warp 4, FixPack 4 or above is required. This is a

<H3><A NAME="Perl_installation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Perl_installation">2.7.1  Installing Perl on Unix</A></H3>

<P>
Perl support for MySQL is provided by means of the
<CODE>DBI</CODE>/<CODE>DBD</CODE> client interface.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl">8.2  MySQL Perl API</A>.  The Perl
<CODE>DBD</CODE>/<CODE>DBI</CODE> client code requires Perl Version 5.004 or later.  The
interface <STRONG>will not work</STRONG> if you have an older version of Perl.

</P>
<P>
MySQL Perl support also requires that you've installed
MySQL client programming support.  If you installed MySQL
from RPM files, client programs are in the client RPM, but client programming
support is in the developer RPM.  Make sure you've installed the latter RPM.

</P>
<P>
As of Version 3.22.8, Perl support is distributed separately from the main
MySQL distribution.  If you want to install Perl support, the files
you will need can be obtained from
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-dbi.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-dbi.html</a>.

</P>
<P>
The Perl distributions are provided as compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> archives and
have names like <TT>`MODULE-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT>, where <CODE>MODULE</CODE> is the
module name and <CODE>VERSION</CODE> is the version number.  You should get the
<CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE>, <CODE>DBI</CODE>, and <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distributions
and install them in that order.  The installation procedure is shown here.
The example shown is for the <CODE>Data-Dumper</CODE> module, but the procedure is
the same for all three distributions:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Unpack the distribution into the current directory:

<PRE>
shell&#62; gunzip &#60; Data-Dumper-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

This command creates a directory named <TT>`Data-Dumper-VERSION'</TT>.

<LI>

Change into the top-level directory of the unpacked distribution:

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd Data-Dumper-VERSION
</PRE>

<LI>

Build the distribution and compile everything:

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make test
shell&#62; make install
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
The <CODE>make test</CODE> command is important because it verifies that the
module is working.  Note that when you run that command during the
<CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> installation to exercise the interface code, the
MySQL server must be running or the test will fail.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild and reinstall the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE>
distribution whenever you install a new release of MySQL,
particularly if you notice symptoms such as all your <CODE>DBI</CODE> scripts
dumping core after you upgrade MySQL.

</P>
<P>
If you don't have the right to install Perl modules in the system directory
or if you to install local Perl modules, the following reference may help

</P>
<P>
To install the MySQL <CODE>DBD</CODE> module with ActiveState Perl on
Windows, you should do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Get ActiveState Perl from
<a HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/</a>
and install it.

<LI>

Open a DOS shell.

<LI>

If required, set the HTTP_proxy variable. For example, you might try:


<PRE>
set HTTP_proxy=my.proxy.com:3128
</PRE>

<LI>

Start the PPM program:


<PRE>
C:\&#62; c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl
</PRE>

<LI>

If you have not already done so, install <CODE>DBI</CODE>:


<PRE>
ppm&#62; install DBI
</PRE>

<LI>

If this succeeds, run the following command:


<PRE>
install \
ftp://ftp.de.uu.net/pub/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED/DBD-mysql-1.2212.x86.ppd
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
The above should work at least with ActiveState Perl Version 5.6.

</P>
<P>
If you can't get the above to work, you should instead install the
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver and connect to MySQL server through
ODBC:

</P>

<PRE>
use DBI;
$dbh= DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:ODBC:$dsn","$user","$password") ||
  die "Got error $DBI::errstr when connecting to $dsn\n";

</P>
<P>
If Perl reports that it can't find the <TT>`../mysql/mysql.so'</TT> module,
then the problem is probably that Perl can't locate the shared library
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
You can fix this by any of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Compile the <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distribution with <CODE>perl
Makefile.PL -static -config</CODE> rather than <CODE>perl Makefile.PL</CODE>.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> to the directory where your other shared
libraries are located (probably <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT> or <TT>`/lib'</TT>).

<LI>

On Linux you can add the pathname of the directory where
<TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located to the <TT>`/etc/ld.so.conf'</TT> file.

<A NAME="IDX356"></A>
<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
<LI>

Add the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libmysqlclient.so'</TT> is located
to the <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> environment variable.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the following errors from <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>,
you are probably using <CODE>gcc</CODE> (or using an old binary compiled with
<CODE>gcc</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__moddi3'
/usr/bin/perl: can't resolve symbol '__divdi3'
</PRE>

<P>
Add <CODE>-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/... -lgcc</CODE> to the link command when the
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> library gets built (check the output from <CODE>make</CODE> for
<TT>`mysql.so'</TT> when you compile the Perl client).  The <CODE>-L</CODE> option
should specify the pathname of the directory where <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> is located
on your system.

</P>
<P>
Another cause of this problem may be that Perl and MySQL aren't both
compiled with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  In this case, you can solve the mismatch by
compiling both with <CODE>gcc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you get the following error from <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE>

</PRE>

<P>
it means that you need to include the compression library, -lz, to the
link line. This can be doing the following change in the file
<TT>`lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
$sysliblist .= " -lm";

to

$sysliblist .= " -lm -lz";
</PRE>

<P>
After this, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> run 'make realclean' and then proceed with the
installation from the beginning.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the Perl module on a system that doesn't support
dynamic linking (like Caldera/SCO) you can generate a static version of
Perl that includes <CODE>DBI</CODE> and <CODE>DBD-mysql</CODE>.  The way this works
is that you generate a version of Perl with the <CODE>DBI</CODE> code linked
in and install it on top of your current Perl.  Then you use that to
build a version of Perl that additionally has the <CODE>DBD</CODE> code linked
in, and install that.

</P>
<P>
On Caldera (SCO), you must have the following environment variables set:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/progressive/lib
or
shell&#62; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; LIBPATH=/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/ccs/lib:\
/usr/progressive/lib:/usr/skunk/lib
shell&#62; MANPATH=scohelp:/usr/man:/usr/local1/man:/usr/local/man:\
/usr/skunk/man:
</PRE>

<P>
First, create a Perl that includes a statically linked <CODE>DBI</CODE> by running
these commands in the directory where your <CODE>DBI</CODE> distribution is
located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Then you must install the new Perl. The output of <CODE>make perl</CODE> will
indicate the exact <CODE>make</CODE> command you will need to execute to perform
the installation.  On Caldera (SCO), this is
<CODE>make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Next, use the just-created Perl to create another Perl that also includes a
statically-linked <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> by running these commands in the
directory where your <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> distribution is located:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; perl Makefile.PL -static -config
shell&#62; make
shell&#62; make install
shell&#62; make perl
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, you should install this new Perl.  Again, the output of <CODE>make
perl</CODE> indicates the command to use.

This chapter provides a tutorial introduction to MySQL by showing
how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client program to create and use a simple
database.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> (sometimes referred to as the ``terminal monitor'' or
just ``monitor'') is an interactive program that allows you to connect to a
MySQL server, run queries, and view the results.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> may
also be used in batch mode: you place your queries in a file beforehand, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute the contents of the file.  Both ways of using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> are covered here.

</P>
<P>
To see a list of options provided by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, invoke it with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --help
</PRE>

<P>
This chapter assumes that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is installed on your machine and that
a MySQL server is available to which you can connect.  If this is
not true, contact your MySQL administrator.  (If <STRONG>you</STRONG> are the
administrator, you will need to consult other sections of this manual.)

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a
database.  If you are interested only in accessing an already-existing
database, you may want to skip over the sections that describe how to
create the database and the tables it contains.

</P>
<P>
Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, many details are necessarily left
out.  Consult the relevant sections of the manual for more

To connect to the server, you'll usually need to provide a MySQL
user name when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE> and, most likely, a password.  If the
server runs on a machine other than the one where you log in, you'll also
need to specify a hostname.  Contact your administrator to find out what
connection parameters you should use to connect (that is, what host, user name,
and password to use).  Once you know the proper parameters, you should be
able to connect like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>********</CODE> represents your password; enter it when <CODE>mysql</CODE>
displays the <CODE>Enter password:</CODE> prompt.

</P>
<P>
If that works, you should see some introductory information followed by a
<CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 459 to server version: 3.22.20a-log

Type 'help' for help.

mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready for you to enter commands.

</P>
<P>
Some MySQL installations allow users to connect as the anonymous
(unnamed) user to the server running on the local host.  If this is the case
on your machine, you should be able to connect to that server by invoking
<CODE>mysql</CODE> without any options:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
After you have connected successfully, you can disconnect any time by typing
<CODE>QUIT</CODE> at the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; QUIT
Bye
</PRE>

<P>
You can also disconnect by pressing Control-D.

</P>
<P>
Most examples in the following sections assume you are connected to the
server.  They indicate this by the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> prompt.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you are connected to the server, as discussed in the previous
section.  Doing so will not in itself select any database to work with, but
that's okay.  At this point, it's more important to find out a little about
how to issue queries than to jump right in creating tables, loading data
into them, and retrieving data from them.  This section describes the basic
principles of entering commands, using several queries you can try out to
familiarise yourself with how <CODE>mysql</CODE> works.

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple command that asks the server to tell you its version number
and the current date.  Type it in as shown here following the <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
prompt and press Enter:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------+--------------+
| VERSION()    | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log | 1999-03-19   |
+--------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
This query illustrates several things about <CODE>mysql</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A command normally consists of a SQL statement followed by a semicolon.
(There are some exceptions where a semicolon is not needed.  <CODE>QUIT</CODE>,
mentioned earlier, is one of them.  We'll get to others later.)

<LI>

When you issue a command, <CODE>mysql</CODE> sends it to the server for execution
and displays the results, then prints another <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> to indicate
that it is ready for another command.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> displays query output as a table (rows and columns).  The first
row contains labels for the columns.  The rows following are the query
results.  Normally, column labels are the names of the columns you fetch from
database tables.  If you're retrieving the value of an expression rather than
a table column (as in the example just shown), <CODE>mysql</CODE> labels the column
using the expression itself.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> shows how many rows were returned and how long the query took
to execute, which gives you a rough idea of server performance.  These values
are imprecise because they represent wall clock time (not CPU or machine
time), and because they are affected by factors such as server load and
network latency.  (For brevity, the ``rows in set'' line is not shown in
the remaining examples in this chapter.)
</UL>

<P>
Keywords may be entered in any lettercase.  The following queries are
equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
mysql&#62; select version(), current_date;
mysql&#62; SeLeCt vErSiOn(), current_DATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Here's another query.  It demonstrates that you can use <CODE>mysql</CODE> as a
simple calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SIN(PI()/4), (4+1)*5;
+-------------+---------+
| SIN(PI()/4) | (4+1)*5 |
+-------------+---------+
|    0.707107 |      25 |
+-------------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
The commands shown thus far have been relatively short, single-line
statements.  You can even enter multiple statements on a single line.
Just end each one with a semicolon:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();
+--------------+
| VERSION()    |
+--------------+
| 3.22.20a-log |
+--------------+

+---------------------+
| NOW()               |
+---------------------+
| 1999-03-19 00:15:33 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
A command need not be given all on a single line, so lengthy commands that
require several lines are not a problem.  <CODE>mysql</CODE> determines where your
statement ends by looking for the terminating semicolon, not by looking for
the end of the input line.  (In other words, <CODE>mysql</CODE>
accepts free-format input:  it collects input lines but does not execute them
until it sees the semicolon.)

</P>
<P>
Here's a simple multiple-line statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; ,
    -&#62; CURRENT_DATE;
+--------------------+--------------+
| USER()             | CURRENT_DATE |
+--------------------+--------------+
| joesmith@localhost | 1999-03-18   |
+--------------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, notice how the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> to
<CODE>-&#62;</CODE> after you enter the first line of a multiple-line query.  This is
how <CODE>mysql</CODE> indicates that it hasn't seen a complete statement and is
waiting for the rest.  The prompt is your friend, because it provides
valuable feedback.  If you use that feedback, you will always be aware of
what <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for.

</P>
<P>
If you decide you don't want to execute a command that you are in the
process of entering, cancel it by typing <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT
    -&#62; USER()
    -&#62; \c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Here, too, notice the prompt.  It switches back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> after you
type <CODE>\c</CODE>, providing feedback to indicate that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is ready
for a new command.

</P>
<P>
The following table shows each of the prompts you may see and summarises what
they mean about the state that <CODE>mysql</CODE> is in:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Prompt</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Ready for new command.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    -&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line of multiple-line command.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    '&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins
with a single quote (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>    "&#62;</CODE> </TD><TD> Waiting for next line, collecting a string that begins
with a double quote (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>).
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
Multiple-line statements commonly occur by accident when you intend to
issue a command on a single line, but forget the terminating semicolon.  In
this case, <CODE>mysql</CODE> waits for more input:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If this happens to you (you think you've entered a statement but the only
response is a <CODE>-&#62;</CODE> prompt), most likely <CODE>mysql</CODE> is waiting for the
semicolon.  If you don't notice what the prompt is telling you, you might sit
there for a while before realising what you need to do.  Enter a semicolon to
complete the statement, and <CODE>mysql</CODE> will execute it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT USER()
    -&#62; ;
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| joesmith@localhost |
+--------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts occur during string collection.
In MySQL, you can write strings surrounded by either <SAMP>`''</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> characters (for example, <CODE>'hello'</CODE> or <CODE>"goodbye"</CODE>),
and <CODE>mysql</CODE> lets you enter strings that span multiple lines.  When you
see a <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt, it means that you've entered a line
containing a string that begins with a <SAMP>`''</SAMP> or <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> quote character,
but have not yet entered the matching quote that terminates the string.
That's fine if you really are entering a multiple-line string, but how likely
is that?  Not very.  More often, the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts indicate
that you've inadvertantly left out a quote character.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
If you enter this <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, then press Enter and wait for the
result, nothing will happen.  Instead of wondering why this
query takes so long, notice the clue provided by the <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompt.  It
tells you that <CODE>mysql</CODE> expects to see the rest of an unterminated
string.  (Do you see the error in the statement?  The string <CODE>"Smith</CODE> is
missing the second quote.)

</P>
<P>
At this point, what do you do?  The simplest thing is to cancel the command.
However, you cannot just type <CODE>\c</CODE> in this case, because <CODE>mysql</CODE>
interprets it as part of the string that it is collecting!  Instead, enter
the closing quote character (so <CODE>mysql</CODE> knows you've finished the
string), then type <CODE>\c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE name = "Smith AND age &#60; 30;
    "&#62; "\c
mysql&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
The prompt changes back to <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>, indicating that <CODE>mysql</CODE>
is ready for a new command.

</P>
<P>
It's important to know what the <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>"&#62;</CODE> prompts signify,
because if you mistakenly enter an unterminated string, any further lines you
type will appear to be ignored by <CODE>mysql</CODE>@-including a line
containing <CODE>QUIT</CODE>!  This can be quite confusing, especially if you
don't know that you need to supply the terminating quote before you can

</P>

<P>
Now that you know how to enter commands, it's time to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have several pets in your home (your menagerie) and you'd
like to keep track of various types of information about them.  You can do so
by creating tables to hold your data and loading them with the desired
information.  Then you can answer different sorts of questions about your
animals by retrieving data from the tables.  This section shows you how to:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Create a database
<LI>

Create a table
<LI>

Load data into the table
<LI>

Retrieve data from the table in various ways
<LI>

Use multiple tables
</UL>

<P>
The menagerie database will be simple (deliberately), but it is not difficult
to think of real-world situations in which a similar type of database might
be used.  For example, a database like this could be used by a farmer to keep
track of livestock, or by a veterinarian to keep track of patient records.
A menagerie distribution containing some of the queries and sample data used
in the following sections can be obtained from the MySQL web site.
It's available in either compressed <CODE>tar</CODE> format
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.tar.gz</a>)
or Zip format
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/Contrib/Examples/menagerie.zip</a>).

</P>
<P>
Use the <CODE>SHOW</CODE> statement to find out what databases currently exist
on the server:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW DATABASES;
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| mysql    |
| test     |
| tmp      |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
The list of databases is probably different on your machine, but the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> and <CODE>test</CODE> databases are likely to be among them.  The
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database is required because it describes user access
privileges.  The <CODE>test</CODE> database is often provided as a workspace for
users to try things out.

</P>
<P>
Note that you may not see all databases if you don't have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>test</CODE> database exists, try to access it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE test
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>USE</CODE>, like <CODE>QUIT</CODE>, does not require a semicolon.  (You
can terminate such statements with a semicolon if you like; it does no harm.)
The <CODE>USE</CODE> statement is special in another way, too:  it must be given on
a single line.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>test</CODE> database (if you have access to it) for the
examples that follow, but anything you create in that database can be
removed by anyone else with access to it.  For this reason, you should
probably ask your MySQL administrator for permission to use a
database of your own.  Suppose you want to call yours <CODE>menagerie</CODE>.  The
administrator needs to execute a command like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL ON menagerie.* TO your_mysql_name;
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>your_mysql_name</CODE> is the MySQL user name assigned to
you.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_database" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_database">3.3.1  Creating and Selecting a Database</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>
<A NAME="IDX374"></A>

</P>
<P>
If the administrator creates your database for you when setting up your
permissions, you can begin using it.  Otherwise, you need to create it
yourself:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE DATABASE menagerie;
</PRE>

<P>
Under Unix, database names are case-sensitive (unlike SQL keywords), so you
must always refer to your database as <CODE>menagerie</CODE>, not as
<CODE>Menagerie</CODE>, <CODE>MENAGERIE</CODE>, or some other variant.  This is also true
for table names.  (Under Windows, this restriction does not apply, although
you must refer to databases and tables using the same lettercase throughout a
given query.)

</P>
<P>
Creating a database does not select it for use; you must do that explicitly.
To make <CODE>menagerie</CODE> the current database, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE menagerie
Database changed
</PRE>

<P>
Your database needs to be created only once, but you must select it for use
each time you begin a <CODE>mysql</CODE> session.  You can do this by issuing a
<CODE>USE</CODE> statement as shown above.  Alternatively, you can select the
database on the command-line when you invoke <CODE>mysql</CODE>.  Just specify its
name after any connection parameters that you might need to provide.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p menagerie
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>menagerie</CODE> is not your password on the command just shown.
If you want to supply your password on the command-line after the <CODE>-p</CODE>
option, you must do so with no intervening space (for example, as
<CODE>-pmypassword</CODE>, not as <CODE>-p mypassword</CODE>).  However, putting your
password on the command-line is not recommended, because doing so exposes it
to snooping by other users logged in on your machine.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Creating_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Creating_tables">3.3.2  Creating a Table</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX375"></A>
<A NAME="IDX376"></A>

</P>
<P>
Creating the database is the easy part, but at this point it's empty, as
<CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> will tell you:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The harder part is deciding what the structure of your database should be:
what tables you will need and what columns will be in each of them.

</P>
<P>
You'll want a table that contains a record for each of your pets.  This can
be called the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, and it should contain, as a bare minimum,
each animal's name.  Because the name by itself is not very interesting, the
table should contain other information.  For example, if more than one person
in your family keeps pets, you might want to list each animal's owner.  You
might also want to record some basic descriptive information such as species
and sex.

</P>
<P>
How about age?  That might be of interest, but it's not a good thing to store
in a database.  Age changes as time passes, which means you'd have to update
your records often.  Instead, it's better to store a fixed value such as
date of birth.  Then, whenever you need age, you can calculate it as the
difference between the current date and the birth date.  MySQL
provides functions for doing date arithmetic, so this is not difficult.
Storing birth date rather than age has other advantages, too:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can use the database for tasks such as generating reminders for upcoming
pet birthdays.  (If you think this type of query is somewhat silly, note that
it is the same question you might ask in the context of a business database
to identify clients to whom you'll soon need to send out birthday greetings,
for that computer-assisted personal touch.)

<LI>

You can calculate age in relation to dates other than the current date.  For
example, if you store death date in the database, you can easily calculate
how old a pet was when it died.
</UL>

<P>
You can probably think of other types of information that would be useful in
the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, but the ones identified so far are sufficient for now:
name, owner, species, sex, birth, and death.

</P>
<P>
Use a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to specify the layout of your table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE pet (name VARCHAR(20), owner VARCHAR(20),
    -&#62; species VARCHAR(20), sex CHAR(1), birth DATE, death DATE);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is a good choice for the <CODE>name</CODE>, <CODE>owner</CODE>, and
<CODE>species</CODE> columns because the column values will vary in length.  The
lengths of those columns need not all be the same, and need not be
<CODE>20</CODE>.  You can pick any length from <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>, whatever
seems most reasonable to you.  (If you make a poor choice and it turns
out later that you need a longer field, MySQL provides an
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Several types of values can be chosen to represent sex in animal records,
such as <CODE>"m"</CODE>
and <CODE>"f"</CODE>, or perhaps <CODE>"male"</CODE> and <CODE>"female"</CODE>.  It's simplest
to use the single characters <CODE>"m"</CODE> and <CODE>"f"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The use of the <CODE>DATE</CODE> data type for the <CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>death</CODE>
columns is a fairly obvious choice.

</P>
<P>
Now that you have created a table, <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> should produce some
output:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
To verify that your table was created the way you expected, use
a <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE> any time, for example, if you forget the names of
the columns in your table or what types they are.

</P>

After creating your table, you need to populate it.  The <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements are useful for this.

</P>

Suppose your pet records can be described as shown here.

</TABLE>

<P>
Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate it is to
create a text file containing a row for each of your animals, then load the
contents of the file into the table with a single statement.

</P>
<P>
You could create a text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> containing one record per line,
with values separated by tabs, and given in the order in which the columns
were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  For missing values (such
as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still living), you can
use <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.  To represent these in your text file, use
<CODE>\N</CODE>.  For example, the record for Whistler the bird would look like
this (where the whitespace between values is a single tab character):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>owner</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>species</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>sex</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>birth</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>death</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To load the text file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> into the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, use this
command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

<P>
You can specify the column value separator and end of line marker explicitly
in the <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement if you wish, but the defaults are tab and
linefeed.  These are sufficient for the statement to read the file
<TT>`pet.txt'</TT> properly.

</P>
<P>
When you want to add new records one at a time, the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
is useful.  In its simplest form, you supply values for each column, in the
order in which the columns were listed in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.
Suppose Diane gets a new hamster named Puffball.  You could add a new record
using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO pet
    -&#62; VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that string and date values are specified as quoted strings here.  Also,
with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, you can insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> directly to represent a
missing value.  You do not use <CODE>\N</CODE> like you do with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
From this example, you should be able to see that there would be a lot more
typing involved to load
your records initially using several <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements rather
than a single <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement is used to pull information from a table.
The general form of the statement is:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT what_to_select
FROM which_table
WHERE conditions_to_satisfy
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>what_to_select</CODE> indicates what you want to see.  This can be a list of
columns, or <CODE>*</CODE> to indicate ``all columns.'' <CODE>which_table</CODE>
indicates the table from which you want to retrieve data.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause is optional.  If it's present, <CODE>conditions_to_satisfy</CODE> specifies
conditions that rows must satisfy to qualify for retrieval.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_all" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_all">3.3.4.1  Selecting All Data</A></H4>

<P>
The simplest form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves everything from a table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet;
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name     | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Fluffy   | Harold | cat     | f    | 1993-02-04 | NULL       |
| Claws    | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL       |
| Buffy    | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL       |
| Fang     | Benny  | dog     | m    | 1990-08-27 | NULL       |
| Bowser   | Diane  | dog     | m    | 1998-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
| Chirpy   | Gwen   | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL       |
| Whistler | Gwen   | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL       |
| Slim     | Benny  | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL       |
| Puffball | Diane  | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL       |
+----------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
This form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is useful if you want to review your entire table,
for instance, after you've just loaded it with your initial dataset.  As it
happens, the output just shown reveals an error in your datafile:  Bowser
appears to have been born after he died!  Consulting your original pedigree
papers, you find that the correct birth year is 1989, not 1998.

</P>
<P>
There are least a couple of ways to fix this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Edit the file <TT>`pet.txt'</TT> to correct the error, then empty the table
and reload it using <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;  # Used for quick re-create of the table
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM pet;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "pet.txt" INTO TABLE pet;
</PRE>

However, if you do this, you must also re-enter the record for Puffball.

<LI>

Fix only the erroneous record with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE pet SET birth = "1989-08-31" WHERE name = "Bowser";
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
As shown above, it is easy to retrieve an entire table.  But typically you
don't want to do that, particularly when the table becomes large.  Instead,
you're usually more interested in answering a particular question, in which
case you specify some constraints on the information you want.  Let's look at
some selection queries in terms of questions about your pets that they
answer.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Selecting_rows" HREF="manual_toc.html#Selecting_rows">3.3.4.2  Selecting Particular Rows</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX384"></A>
<A NAME="IDX385"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can select only particular rows from your table.  For example, if you want
to verify the change that you made to Bowser's birth date, select Bowser's
record like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name = "Bowser";
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| name   | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death      |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
| Bowser | Diane | dog     | m    | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |
+--------+-------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
The output confirms that the year is correctly recorded now as 1989, not 1998.

</P>
<P>
String comparisons are normally case-insensitive, so you can specify the
name as <CODE>"bowser"</CODE>, <CODE>"BOWSER"</CODE>, etc.  The query result will be
the same.

</P>
<P>
You can specify conditions on any column, not just <CODE>name</CODE>.  For example,
if you want to know which animals were born after 1998, test the <CODE>birth</CODE>
column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth &#62;= "1998-1-1";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Puffball | Diane | hamster | f    | 1999-03-30 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can combine conditions, for example, to locate female dogs:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "dog" AND sex = "f";
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The preceding query uses the <CODE>AND</CODE> logical operator.  There is also an
<CODE>OR</CODE> operator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = "snake" OR species = "bird";
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name     | owner | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Chirpy   | Gwen  | bird    | f    | 1998-09-11 | NULL  |
| Whistler | Gwen  | bird    | NULL | 1997-12-09 | NULL  |
| Slim     | Benny | snake   | m    | 1996-04-29 | NULL  |
+----------+-------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>AND</CODE> and <CODE>OR</CODE> may be intermixed.  If you do that, it's a good idea
to use parentheses to indicate how conditions should be grouped:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = "cat" AND sex = "m")
    -&#62; OR (species = "dog" AND sex = "f");
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| name  | owner  | species | sex  | birth      | death |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
| Claws | Gwen   | cat     | m    | 1994-03-17 | NULL  |
| Buffy | Harold | dog     | f    | 1989-05-13 | NULL  |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to see entire rows from your table, just name the columns
in which you're interested, separated by commas.  For example, if you want to
know when your animals were born, select the <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
columns:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |
+----------+------------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |
| Claws    | 1994-03-17 |
| Buffy    | 1989-05-13 |
| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |
+----------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
To find out who owns pets, use this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |
+--------+
| Harold |
| Gwen   |
| Harold |
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
| Gwen   |
| Gwen   |
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX388"></A>
However, notice that the query simply retrieves the <CODE>owner</CODE> field from
each record, and some of them appear more than once.  To minimise the output,
retrieve each unique output record just once by adding the keyword
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM pet;
+--------+
| owner  |
+--------+
| Benny  |
| Diane  |
| Gwen   |
| Harold |
+--------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can use a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to combine row selection with column
selection.  For example, to get birth dates for dogs and cats only,
use this query:

You may have noticed in the preceding examples that the result rows are
displayed in no particular order.  However, it's often easier to examine
query output when the rows are sorted in some meaningful way.  To sort a
result, use an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
Here are animal birthdays, sorted by date:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth;
+----------+------------+

<P>
On character type columns, sorting@-like all other comparison
operations@-is normally performed in a case-insensitive fashion.
This means that the order will be undefined for columns that are identical
except for their case. You can force a case-sensitive sort by using the
BINARY cast: <CODE>ORDER BY BINARY(field)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the
name of the column you are sorting by:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet ORDER BY birth DESC;
+----------+------------+
| name     | birth      |

<P>
You can sort on multiple columns.  For example, to sort by type of
animal, then by birth date within animal type with youngest animals first,
use the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, species, birth FROM pet ORDER BY species, birth DESC;

MySQL provides several functions that you can use to perform
calculations on dates, for example, to calculate ages or extract
parts of dates.

</P>
<P>
To determine how many years old each of your pets is, compute the
difference in the year part of the current date and the birth date, then
subtract one if the current date occurs earlier in the calendar year than
the birth date.  The following query shows, for each pet, the birth date,
the current date, and the age in years.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
    -&#62; (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))

<P>
Here, <CODE>YEAR()</CODE> pulls out the year part of a date and <CODE>RIGHT()</CODE>
pulls off the rightmost five characters that represent the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE>
(calendar year) part of the date.  The part of the expression that
compares the <CODE>MM-DD</CODE> values evaluates to 1 or 0, which adjusts the
year difference down a year if <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE> occurs earlier in
the year than <CODE>birth</CODE>.  The full expression is somewhat ungainly,
so an alias (<CODE>age</CODE>) is used to make the output column label more
meaningful.

</P>
<P>
The query works, but the result could be scanned more easily if the rows
were presented in some order.  This can be done by adding an <CODE>ORDER
BY name</CODE> clause to sort the output by name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
    -&#62; (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))

+----------+------------+--------------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
To sort the output by <CODE>age</CODE> rather than <CODE>name</CODE>, just use a
different <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, CURRENT_DATE,
    -&#62; (YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)-YEAR(birth))

<P>
A similar query can be used to determine age at death for animals that have
died.  You determine which animals these are by checking whether the
<CODE>death</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  Then, for those with non-<CODE>NULL</CODE>
values, compute the difference between the <CODE>death</CODE> and <CODE>birth</CODE>
values:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, death,
    -&#62; (YEAR(death)-YEAR(birth)) - (RIGHT(death,5)&#60;RIGHT(birth,5))
    -&#62; AS age
    -&#62; FROM pet WHERE death IS NOT NULL ORDER BY age;
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| name   | birth      | death      | age  |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
| Bowser | 1989-08-31 | 1995-07-29 |    5 |
+--------+------------+------------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The query uses <CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> rather than <CODE>death &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>
because <CODE>NULL</CODE> is a special value.  This is explained later.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Working_with_NULL">3.3.4.6  Working with <CODE>NULL</CODE> Values</A>.

</P>
<P>
What if you want to know which animals have birthdays next month?  For this
type of calculation, year and day are irrelevant; you simply want to extract
the month part of the <CODE>birth</CODE> column.  MySQL provides several
date-part extraction functions, such as <CODE>YEAR()</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, and
<CODE>DAYOFMONTH()</CODE>.  <CODE>MONTH()</CODE> is the appropriate function here.  To
see how it works, run a simple query that displays the value of both
<CODE>birth</CODE> and <CODE>MONTH(birth)</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth, MONTH(birth) FROM pet;
+----------+------------+--------------+
| name     | birth      | MONTH(birth) |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| Fluffy   | 1993-02-04 |            2 |

| Fang     | 1990-08-27 |            8 |
| Bowser   | 1989-08-31 |            8 |
| Chirpy   | 1998-09-11 |            9 |
| Whistler | 1997-12-09 |           12 |
| Slim     | 1996-04-29 |            4 |
| Puffball | 1999-03-30 |            3 |
+----------+------------+--------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Finding animals with birthdays in the upcoming month is easy, too.  Suppose
the current month is April.  Then the month value is <CODE>4</CODE> and you look
for animals born in May (month 5) like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet WHERE MONTH(birth) = 5;
+-------+------------+
| name  | birth      |
+-------+------------+
| Buffy | 1989-05-13 |
+-------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There is a small complication if the current month is December, of course.
You don't just add one to the month number (<CODE>12</CODE>) and look for animals
born in month 13, because there is no such month.  Instead, you look for
animals born in January (month 1).

</P>
<P>
You can even write the query so that it works no matter what the current
month is.  That way you don't have to use a particular month number
in the query.  <CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> allows you to add a time interval to a
given date.  If you add a month to the value of <CODE>NOW()</CODE>, then extract
the month part with <CODE>MONTH()</CODE>, the result produces the month in which to
look for birthdays:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MONTH(DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
</PRE>

<P>
A different way to accomplish the same task is to add <CODE>1</CODE> to get the
next month after the current one (after using the modulo function (<CODE>MOD</CODE>)
to wrap around the month value to <CODE>0</CODE> if it is currently
<CODE>12</CODE>):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT name, birth FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE MONTH(birth) = MOD(MONTH(NOW()), 12) + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <CODE>MONTH</CODE> returns a number between 1 and 12. And
<CODE>MOD(something,12)</CODE> returns a number between 0 and 11. So the
addition has to be after the <CODE>MOD()</CODE>, otherwise we would go from
November (11) to January (1).

</P>

<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<A NAME="IDX398"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE> value can be surprising until you get used to it.
Conceptually, <CODE>NULL</CODE> means missing value or unknown value and it
is treated somewhat differently than other values.  To test for <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
you cannot use the arithmetic comparison operators such as <CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>,
or <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE>.  To demonstrate this for yourself, try the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 = NULL, 1 &#60;&#62; NULL, 1 &#60; NULL, 1 &#62; NULL;
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
| 1 = NULL | 1 &#60;&#62; NULL | 1 &#60; NULL | 1 &#62; NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
|     NULL |      NULL |     NULL |     NULL |
+----------+-----------+----------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Clearly you get no meaningful results from these comparisons.  Use
the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and <CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 IS NULL, 1 IS NOT NULL;
+-----------+---------------+
| 1 IS NULL | 1 IS NOT NULL |
+-----------+---------------+
|         0 |             1 |
+-----------+---------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in MySQL, 0 or <CODE>NULL</CODE> means false and anything else means
true. The default truth value from a boolean operation is 1.

</P>
<P>
This special treatment of <CODE>NULL</CODE> is why, in the previous section, it
was necessary to determine which animals are no longer alive using
<CODE>death IS NOT NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>death &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Two <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are regarded as equal in a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented first if you
do <CODE>ORDER BY ... ASC</CODE> and last if you do <CODE>ORDER BY ... DESC</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that between MySQL 4.0.2 - 4.0.10, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values incorrectly
were always sorted first regardless of the sort direction.

MySQL provides standard SQL pattern matching as well as a form of
pattern matching based on extended regular expressions similar to those used
by Unix utilities such as <CODE>vi</CODE>, <CODE>grep</CODE>, and <CODE>sed</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
SQL pattern matching allows you to use <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> to match any single
character and <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to match an arbitrary number of characters (including
zero characters).  In MySQL, SQL patterns are case-insensitive by
default.  Some examples are shown here.  Note that you do not use <CODE>=</CODE>
or <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> when you use SQL patterns; use the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> or <CODE>NOT
LIKE</CODE> comparison operators instead.

+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The other type of pattern matching provided by MySQL uses extended
regular expressions.  When you test for a match for this type of pattern, use
the <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> and <CODE>NOT REGEXP</CODE> operators (or <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> and
<CODE>NOT RLIKE</CODE>, which are synonyms).

</P>
<P>
Some characteristics of extended regular expressions are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> matches any single character.

<LI>

A character class <SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP> matches any character within the brackets.
For example, <SAMP>`[abc]'</SAMP> matches <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  To name a
range of characters, use a dash.  <SAMP>`[a-z]'</SAMP> matches any lowercase letter,
whereas <SAMP>`[0-9]'</SAMP> matches any digit.

<LI>

<SAMP>`*'</SAMP> matches zero or more instances of the thing preceding it.  For
example, <SAMP>`x*'</SAMP> matches any number of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> characters,
<SAMP>`[0-9]*'</SAMP> matches any number of digits, and <SAMP>`.*'</SAMP> matches any
number of anything.

<LI>

The pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the value being tested.
(SQL patterns match only if they match the entire value.)

<LI>

To anchor a pattern so that it must match the beginning or end of the value
being tested, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> at the beginning or <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> at the end of the
pattern.
</UL>

<P>
To demonstrate how extended regular expressions work, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> queries
shown previously are rewritten here to use <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To find names beginning with <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> to match the beginning of
the name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^b";

+--------+--------+---------+------+------------+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
Prior to MySQL Version 3.23.4, <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case-sensitive,
and the previous query will return no rows. To match either lowercase or
uppercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, use this query instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP "^[bB]";
</PRE>

<P>
From MySQL 3.23.4 on, to force a <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> comparison to
be case-sensitive, use the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword to make one of the
strings a binary string. This query will match only lowercase <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>
at the beginning of a name:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM pet WHERE name REGEXP BINARY "^b";
</PRE>

<P>
To find names ending with <SAMP>`fy'</SAMP>, use <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> to match the end of the

Because a regular expression pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the

side of the pattern to get it to match the entire value like it would be if
you used a SQL pattern.

<P>
To find names containing exactly five characters, use <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>
to match the beginning and end of the name, and five instances of <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>
in between:

<P>
Databases are often used to answer the question, ``How often does a certain
type of data occur in a table?''  For example, you might want to know how
many pets you have, or how many pets each owner has, or you might want to
perform various kinds of censuses on your animals.

</P>
<P>
Counting the total number of animals you have is the same question as ``How
many rows are in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table?'' because there is one record per pet.
The <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> function counts the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> results, so
the query to count your animals looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        9 |
+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Earlier, you retrieved the names of the people who owned pets.  You can
use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE> if you want to find out how many pets each owner has:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY owner;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+
| Benny  |        2 |
| Diane  |        2 |
| Gwen   |        3 |
| Harold |        2 |
+--------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to group together all records for each
<CODE>owner</CODE>.  Without it, all you get is an error message:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT owner, COUNT(owner) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140 at line 1: Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>COUNT()</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> are useful for characterising your
data in various ways.  The following examples show different ways to
perform animal census operations.

</P>
<P>
Number of animals per species:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
+---------+----------+
| species | COUNT(*) |
+---------+----------+
| bird    |        2 |
| cat     |        2 |
| dog     |        3 |
| hamster |        1 |
| snake   |        1 |
+---------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Number of animals per sex:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY sex;
+------+----------+
| sex  | COUNT(*) |
+------+----------+
| NULL |        1 |
| f    |        4 |
| m    |        4 |
+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
(In this output, <CODE>NULL</CODE> indicates sex unknown.)

</P>
<P>
Number of animals per combination of species and sex:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| bird    | NULL |        1 |
| bird    | f    |        1 |
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
| hamster | f    |        1 |
| snake   | m    |        1 |
+---------+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
You need not retrieve an entire table when you use <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.  For
example, the previous query, when performed just on dogs and cats, looks like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE species = "dog" OR species = "cat"
    -&#62; GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
+---------+------+----------+
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you wanted the number of animals per sex only for known-sex animals:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT species, sex, COUNT(*) FROM pet
    -&#62; WHERE sex IS NOT NULL
    -&#62; GROUP BY species, sex;
+---------+------+----------+
| species | sex  | COUNT(*) |
+---------+------+----------+
| bird    | f    |        1 |
| cat     | f    |        1 |
| cat     | m    |        1 |
| dog     | f    |        1 |
| dog     | m    |        2 |
| hamster | f    |        1 |

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>pet</CODE> table keeps track of which pets you have.  If you want to
record other information about them, such as events in their lives like
visits to the vet or when litters are born, you need another table.  What
should this table look like? It needs:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To contain the pet name so you know which animal each event pertains
to.

<LI>

A date so you know when the event occurred.

<LI>

A field to describe the event.

<LI>

An event type field, if you want to be able to categorise events.
</UL>

<P>
Given these considerations, the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement for the
<CODE>event</CODE> table might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE event (name VARCHAR(20), date DATE,
    -&#62; type VARCHAR(15), remark VARCHAR(255));
</PRE>

<P>
As with the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, it's easiest to load the initial records
by creating a tab-delimited text file containing the information:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>date</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>remark</STRONG>

</TABLE>

<P>
Load the records like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "event.txt" INTO TABLE event;
</PRE>

<P>
Based on what you've learned from the queries you've run on the <CODE>pet</CODE>
table, you should be able to perform retrievals on the records in the
<CODE>event</CODE> table; the principles are the same.  But when is the
<CODE>event</CODE> table by itself insufficient to answer questions you might ask?

</P>
<P>
Suppose you want to find out the ages of each pet when they had their
litters.  The <CODE>event</CODE> table indicates when this occurred, but to
calculate the age of the mother, you need her birth date.  Because that is
stored in the <CODE>pet</CODE> table, you need both tables for the query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT pet.name,
    -&#62; (TO_DAYS(date) - TO_DAYS(birth))/365 AS age,
    -&#62; remark
    -&#62; FROM pet, event
    -&#62; WHERE pet.name = event.name AND type = "litter";
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| name   | age  | remark                      |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
| Fluffy | 2.27 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
| Buffy  | 4.12 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
| Buffy  | 5.10 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |
+--------+------+-----------------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
There are several things to note about this query:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause lists two tables because the query needs to pull
information from both of them.

<LI>

When combining (joining) information from multiple tables, you need to
specify how records in one table can be matched to records in the other.
This is easy because they both have a <CODE>name</CODE> column.  The query uses
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to match up records in the two tables based on the
<CODE>name</CODE> values.

<LI>

Because the <CODE>name</CODE> column occurs in both tables, you must be specific
about which table you mean when referring to the column.  This is done
by prepending the table name to the column name.
</UL>

<P>
You need not have two different tables to perform a join.  Sometimes it is
useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in a table
to other records in that same table.  For example, to find breeding pairs
among your pets, you can join the <CODE>pet</CODE> table with itself to pair up
males and females of like species:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
    -&#62; FROM pet AS p1, pet AS p2
    -&#62; WHERE p1.species = p2.species AND p1.sex = "f" AND p2.sex = "m";
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
| Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
| Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
| Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
+--------+------+--------+------+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
In this query, we specify aliases for the table name in order
to refer to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table
each column reference is associated with.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX408"></A>

</P>
<P>
What if you forget the name of a database or table, or what the structure of
a given table is (for example, what its columns are called)?  MySQL
addresses this problem through several statements that provide information
about the databases and tables it supports.

</P>
<P>
You have already seen <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>, which lists the databases
managed by the server.  To find out which database is currently selected,
use the <CODE>DATABASE()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATABASE();
+------------+
| DATABASE() |
+------------+
| menagerie  |
+------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you haven't selected any database yet, the result is blank.

</P>
<P>
To find out what tables the current database contains (for example, when
you're not sure about the name of a table), use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SHOW TABLES;
+---------------------+
| Tables in menagerie |
+---------------------+
| event               |
| pet                 |
+---------------------+
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>
command is useful; it displays information about each of a table's columns:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DESCRIBE pet;
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+---------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>Field</CODE> indicates the column name, <CODE>Type</CODE> is the data type for
the column, <CODE>NULL</CODE> indicates whether the column can contain
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values, <CODE>Key</CODE> indicates whether the column is
indexed, and <CODE>Default</CODE> specifies the column's default value.

</P>
<P>
If you have indexes on a table,
<CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE> produces information about them.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX409"></A>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here are examples of how to solve some common problems with
MySQL.

</P>
<P>
Some of the examples use the table <CODE>shop</CODE> to hold the price of each
article (item number) for certain traders (dealers).  Supposing that each
trader has a single fixed price per article, then (<CODE>article</CODE>,
<CODE>dealer</CODE>) is a primary key for the records.

</P>
<P>
Start the command-line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> and select a database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql your-database-name
</PRE>

<P>
(In most MySQL installations, you can use the database-name 'test').

</P>
<P>
You can create the example table as:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE shop (
 article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
 dealer  CHAR(20)                 DEFAULT ''     NOT NULL,
 price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY(article, dealer));

INSERT INTO shop VALUES
(1,'A',3.45),(1,'B',3.99),(2,'A',10.99),(3,'B',1.45),(3,'C',1.69),
(3,'D',1.25),(4,'D',19.95);
</PRE>

<P>
Okay, so the example data is:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM shop;

+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | A      |  3.45 |
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | B      |  1.45 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0003 | D      |  1.25 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
``Find number, dealer, and price of the most expensive article.''

</P>
<P>
In ANSI SQL (and MySQL Version 4.1) this is easily done with a subquery:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop)
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 4.1, just do it in two steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the maximum price value from the table with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.
<LI>

Using this value compile the actual query:

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=19.95
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Another solution is to sort all rows descending by price and only
get the first row using the MySQL-specific <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  If there are several most expensive articles (for example, each 19.95)
the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> solution shows only one of them!

+---------+-------+

+---------+-------+
|    0001 |  3.99 |

<P>
``For each article, find the dealer(s) with the most expensive price.''

</P>
<P>
In ANSI SQL (and MySQL Version 4.1 or greater), I'd do it with a subquery like this:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop s1
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
              FROM shop s2
              WHERE s1.article = s2.article);
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 4.1 it's best do it in several steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Get the list of (article,maxprice).
<LI>

For each article get the corresponding rows that have the stored maximum
price.
</OL>

<P>
This can easily be done with a temporary table:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp (
        article INT(4) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL DEFAULT '0000' NOT NULL,
        price   DOUBLE(16,2)             DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL);

LOCK TABLES shop read;

INSERT INTO tmp SELECT article, MAX(price) FROM shop GROUP BY article;

SELECT shop.article, dealer, shop.price FROM shop, tmp
WHERE shop.article=tmp.article AND shop.price=tmp.price;

UNLOCK TABLES;

DROP TABLE tmp;
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't use a <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table, you must also lock the 'tmp' table.

</P>
<P>
``Can it be done with a single query?''

</P>
<P>
Yes, but only by using a quite inefficient trick that I call the
``MAX-CONCAT trick'':

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT article,
       SUBSTRING( MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 7) AS dealer,
  0.00+LEFT(      MAX( CONCAT(LPAD(price,6,'0'),dealer) ), 6) AS price
FROM   shop
GROUP BY article;

+---------+--------+-------+
| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |
+---------+--------+-------+
</PRE>

<P>
The last example can, of course, be made a bit more efficient by doing the
splitting of the concatenated column in the client.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="example-user-variables" HREF="manual_toc.html#example-user-variables">3.5.5  Using user variables</A></H3>

<P>
You can use MySQL user variables to remember results without
having to store them in temporary variables in the client.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Variables">6.1.4  User Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
For example, to find the articles with the highest and lowest price you
can do:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT @min_price:=MIN(price),@max_price:=MAX(price) FROM shop;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM shop WHERE price=@min_price OR price=@max_price;

| article | dealer | price |
+---------+--------+-------+

foreign key constraints. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>.
See also section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys">1.7.4.5  Foreign Keys</A>.

</P>
<P>
You don't actually need foreign keys to join 2 tables.
The only thing MySQL currently doesn't do (in table types other than
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>), is <CODE>CHECK</CODE> to make sure that the keys you use
really exist in the table(s) you're referencing and it
doesn't automatically delete rows from a table with a foreign key
definition. If you use your keys like normal, it'll work just fine:

<P>
MySQL doesn't yet optimise when you search on two different
keys combined with <CODE>OR</CODE> (searching on one key with different <CODE>OR</CODE>
parts is optimised quite well):

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1'
OR  field2_index = '1'
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that we haven't yet had time to come up with an efficient
way to handle this in the general case. (The <CODE>AND</CODE> handling is,
in comparison, now completely general and works very well.)

</P>
<P>
For the moment you can solve this very efficiently by using a
<CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> table. This type of optimisation is also very good if
you are using very complicated queries where the SQL server does the
optimisations in the wrong order.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field1_index = '1';
INSERT INTO tmp
SELECT field1_index, field2_index FROM test_table WHERE field2_index = '1';
SELECT * from tmp;
DROP TABLE tmp;
</PRE>

<P>
The above way to solve this query is in effect a <CODE>UNION</CODE> of two queries.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#UNION">6.4.1.2  <CODE>UNION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following shows an idea of how you can use the bit group functions
to calculate the number of days per month a user has visited a web page.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (year YEAR(4), month INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL,
             day INT(2) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2000,1,1),(2000,1,20),(2000,1,30),(2000,2,2),
            (2000,2,23),(2000,2,23);
SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_OR(1&#60;&#60;day)) AS days FROM t1
       GROUP BY year,month;

Which returns:

+------+-------+------+
| year | month | days |
+------+-------+------+
| 2000 |    01 |    3 |
| 2000 |    02 |    2 |
+------+-------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The above calculates how many different days was used for a given
year/month combination, with automatic removal of duplicate entries.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="example-AUTO_INCREMENT" HREF="manual_toc.html#example-AUTO_INCREMENT">3.5.9  Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX420"></A>
The <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute can be used to generate a unique
identity for new rows:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE animals (
             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id)
             );
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ("dog"),("cat"),("penguin"),
                                  ("lax"),("whale");
SELECT * FROM animals;

Which returns:

+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | dog     |
|  2 | cat     |
|  3 | penguin |
|  4 | lax     |
|  5 | whale   |
+----+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
You can retrieve the used <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> key with the
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> SQL function or the <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> API
function.
Note: for a multi-row insert,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>/<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> will actually return the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> key from the <STRONG>first</STRONG> inserted row. This allows
multi-row inserts to be reproduced on other servers.

</P>
<P>
For MyISAM and BDB tables you can specify <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> on
secondary column in a multi-column key.  In this case the generated
value for the autoincrement column is calculated as
<CODE>MAX(auto_increment_column)+1) WHERE prefix=given-prefix</CODE>.  This is
useful when you want to put data into ordered groups.

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE animals (
             grp ENUM('fish','mammal','bird') NOT NULL,
             id MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
             name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (grp,id)
             );
INSERT INTO animals (grp,name) VALUES("mammal","dog"),("mammal","cat"),
                  ("bird","penguin"),("fish","lax"),("mammal","whale");
SELECT * FROM animals ORDER BY grp,id;

Which returns:

+--------+----+---------+
| grp    | id | name    |
+--------+----+---------+
| fish   |  1 | lax     |
| mammal |  1 | dog     |
| mammal |  2 | cat     |
| mammal |  3 | whale   |
| bird   |  1 | penguin |
+--------+----+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in this case, the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value will be reused if you
delete the row with the biggest <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value in any group.

</P>
<P>
In the previous sections, you used <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively to enter
queries and view the results.  You can also run <CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch
mode.  To do this, put the commands you want to run in a file, then
tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its input from the file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file
</PRE>

<P>
If you are running <CODE>mysql</CODE> under windows and have some special
characters in the file that causes problems, you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
dos&#62; mysql -e "source batch-file"
</PRE>

<P>
If you need to specify connection parameters on the command-line, the
command might look like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h host -u user -p &#60; batch-file
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>mysql</CODE> this way, you are creating a script file, then
executing the script.

</P>
<P>
If you want the script to continue even if you have errors, you should
use the <CODE>--force</CODE> command-line option.

</P>
<P>
Why use a script?  Here are a few reasons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run a query repeatedly (say, every day or every week), making it a
script allows you to avoid retyping it each time you execute it.

<LI>

You can generate new queries from existing ones that are similar by copying
and editing script files.

<LI>

Batch mode can also be useful while you're developing a query, particularly
for multiple-line commands or multiple-statement sequences of commands.  If
you make a mistake, you don't have to retype everything.  Just edit your
script to correct the error, then tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to execute it again.

<LI>

If you have a query that produces a lot of output, you can run the output
through a pager rather than watching it scroll off the top of your screen:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file | more
</PRE>

<LI>

You can catch the output in a file for further processing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql &#60; batch-file &#62; mysql.out
</PRE>

<LI>

You can distribute your script to other people so they can run the commands,
too.

<LI>

Some situations do not allow for interactive use, for example, when you run
a query from a <CODE>cron</CODE> job.  In this case, you must use batch mode.
</UL>

<P>
The default output format is different (more concise) when you run
<CODE>mysql</CODE> in batch mode than when you use it interactively.  For
example, the output of <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT species FROM pet</CODE> looks like
this when run interactively:

</P>

<PRE>
+---------+
| species |
+---------+
| bird    |
| cat     |
| dog     |
| hamster |
| snake   |
+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
But like this when run in batch mode:

</P>

<PRE>
species
bird
cat
dog
hamster
snake
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to get the interactive output format in batch mode, use
<CODE>mysql -t</CODE>.  To echo to the output the commands that are executed, use
<CODE>mysql -vvv</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can also use scripts in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line prompt by
using the <CODE>source</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; source filename;
</PRE>

At Analytikerna and Lentus, we have been doing the systems and field work
for a big research project. This project is a collaboration between the
Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet Stockholm
and the Section on Clinical Research in Aging and Psychology at the
University of Southern California.

</P>
<P>
The project involves a screening part where all twins in Sweden older
than 65 years are interviewed by telephone. Twins who meet certain
criteria are passed on to the next stage. In this latter stage, twins who
want to participate are visited by a doctor/nurse team. Some of the
examinations include physical and neuropsychological examination,
laboratory testing, neuroimaging, psychological status assessment, and family
history collection. In addition, data are collected on medical and
environmental risk factors.

<P>
Some explanations:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CONCAT(p1.id, p1.tvab) + 0 AS tvid</CODE>
<DD>
We want to sort on the concatenated <CODE>id</CODE> and <CODE>tvab</CODE> in
numerical order. Adding <CODE>0</CODE> to the result causes MySQL to
treat the result as a number.
<DT>column <CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a pair of twins. It is a key in all tables.
<DT>column <CODE>tvab</CODE>
<DD>
This identifies a twin in a pair. It has a value of <CODE>1</CODE> or <CODE>2</CODE>.
<DT>column <CODE>ptvab</CODE>
<DD>
This is an inverse of <CODE>tvab</CODE>. When <CODE>tvab</CODE> is <CODE>1</CODE> this is
<CODE>2</CODE>, and vice versa. It exists to save typing and to make it easier for
MySQL to optimise the query.
</DL>

<P>
This query demonstrates, among other things, how to do lookups on a
table from the same table with a join (<CODE>p1</CODE> and <CODE>p2</CODE>). In the example, this
is used to check whether a twin's partner died before the age of 65. If so,
the row is not returned.

</P>
<P>
All of the above exist in all tables with twin-related information. We
have a key on both <CODE>id,tvab</CODE> (all tables), and <CODE>id,ptvab</CODE>
(<CODE>person_data</CODE>) to make queries faster.

</P>
<P>
On our production machine (A 200MHz UltraSPARC), this query returns
about 150-200 rows and takes less than one second.

from the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>server</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> and
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> groups.  An embedded MySQL server usually reads
options from the <CODE>server</CODE>, <CODE>embedded</CODE> and
<CODE>xxxxx_SERVER</CODE>, where <CODE>xxxxx</CODE> is the name of the application.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> accepts the following command-line options. For a full list
execute <CODE>mysqld --help</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--ansi</CODE>
<DD>
Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<DT><CODE>-b, --basedir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to installation directory. All paths are usually resolved relative to
this.

<DT><CODE>--big-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on file.  It solves
most 'table full' errors, but also slows down the queries where
in-memory tables would suffice.  Since Version 3.23.2, MySQL is
able to solve it automatically by using memory for small temporary
tables and switching to disk tables where necessary.

<DT><CODE>--bind-address=IP</CODE>
<DD>
IP address to bind to.

<DT><CODE>--console</CODE>
<DD>
Write the error log messages to stderr/stdout even if <CODE>--log-error</CODE>
is specified.  On windows mysqld will not close the console screen if
this option is used.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--chroot=path</CODE>
<DD>
Put <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon in chroot environment at startup. Recommended
security measure since MySQL 4.0 (MySQL 3.23 is not able to provide
100% closed chroot jail).
It somewhat limits <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> though.

<DT><CODE>--core-file</CODE>
<DD>
Write a core file if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies.  For some systems you must also
specify <CODE>--core-file-size</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.
Note that on some systems, like Solaris, you will
not get a core file if you are also using the <CODE>--user</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>-h, --datadir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to the database root.

<DT><CODE>--debug[...]=</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you can use this
option to get a trace file of what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is doing.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=charset</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<DT><CODE>--default-table-type=type</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default table type for tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<DT><CODE>--delay-key-write[= OFF | ON | ALL]</CODE>
<DD>
How MyISAM <CODE>DELAYED KEYS</CODE> should be used. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--delay-key-write-for-all-tables;  In MySQL 4.0.3 you should use --delay-key-write=ALL instead.</CODE>
<DD>
Don't flush key buffers between writes for any <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--des-key-file=filename</CODE>
<DD>
Read the default keys used by <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE> and <CODE>DES_DECRYPT()</CODE>
from this file.

<DT><CODE>--enable-external-locking (was --enable-locking)</CODE>
<DD>
Enable system locking.  Note that if you use this option on a system on
which <CODE>lockd</CODE> does not fully work (as on Linux), you will easily get
mysqld to deadlock.

<DT><CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>
<DD>
Enable support for named pipes (only on NT/Win2000/XP).

<DT><CODE>-T, --exit-info</CODE>
<DD>
This is a bit mask of different flags one can use for debugging the
mysqld server; one should not use this option if one doesn't know
exactly what it does!

<DT><CODE>--flush</CODE>
<DD>
Flush all changes to disk after each SQL command.  Normally MySQL
only does a write of all changes to disk after each SQL command and lets
the operating system handle the syncing to disk.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display short help and exit.

<DT><CODE>--init-file=file</CODE>
<DD>
Read SQL commands from this file at startup.

<DT><CODE>-L, --language=...</CODE>
<DD>
Client error messages in given language.  May be given as a full path.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Languages">4.6.2  Non-English Error Messages</A>.

<DT><CODE>-l, --log[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log connections and queries to file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-bin=[file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all queries that changes data to the file. Used for backup and replication.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-bin-index[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Index file for binary log file names. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-error[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log errors and startup messages to this file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-isam[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all ISAM/MyISAM changes to file (only used when debugging ISAM/MyISAM).

<DT><CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log all queries that have taken more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds to
execute to file.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-update[=file]</CODE>
<DD>
Log updates to <CODE>file.#</CODE> where <CODE>#</CODE> is a unique number if not given.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>.

<DT><CODE>--log-long-format</CODE>
<DD>
Log some extra information to update log.  If you are using
<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE> then queries that are not using indexes are logged
to the slow query log.

<DT><CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
<DD>
Table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>/<CODE>DELETE</CODE>/<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>)
will have lower priority than selects.  It can also be done via
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> to lower
the priority of only one query, or by
<CODE>SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE> to change the priority in one
thread.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A>.

<DT><CODE>--memlock</CODE>
<DD>
Lock the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process in memory.  This works only if your
system supports the <CODE>mlockall()</CODE> system call (like Solaris).  This
may help if you have a problem where the operating system is causing
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> to swap on disk.

<DT><CODE>--myisam-recover [=option[,option...]]]</CODE>
<DD>
Option is any combination
of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>, <CODE>BACKUP</CODE>, <CODE>FORCE</CODE> or <CODE>QUICK</CODE>.  You can
also set this explicitly to <CODE>""</CODE> if you want to disable this
option. If this option is used, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will on open check if the
table is marked as crashed or if the table wasn't closed properly.
(The last option only works if you are running with
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.)  If this is the case <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will run
check on the table. If the table was corrupted, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
attempt to repair it.

The following options affects how the repair works.

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>DEFAULT </TD><TD> The same as not giving any option to
                    <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>BACKUP </TD><TD> If the data table was changed during recover, save a
                    backup of the <TT>`table_name.MYD'</TT> datafile as
                    <TT>`table_name-datetime.BAK'</TT>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>FORCE </TD><TD> Run recover even if we will lose more than one row
                    from the .MYD file.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>QUICK </TD><TD> Don't check the rows in the table if there aren't any
                    delete blocks.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Before a table is automatically repaired, MySQL will add a note
about this in the error log.  If you want to be able to recover from most
things without user intervention, you should use the options
<CODE>BACKUP,FORCE</CODE>.  This will force a repair of a table even if some rows
would be deleted, but it will keep the old datafile as a backup so that
you can later examine what happened.

<DT><CODE>--pid-file=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to pid file used by <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to listen for TCP/IP connections.

<DT><CODE>-o, --old-protocol</CODE>
<DD>
Use the 3.20 protocol for compatibility with some very old clients.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Upgrading-from-3.20">2.5.5  Upgrading from Version 3.20 to Version 3.21</A>.

<DT><CODE>--one-thread</CODE>
<DD>
Only use one thread (for debugging under Linux).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>-O, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Give a variable a value. <CODE>--help</CODE> lists variables.  You can find a full
description for all variables in the <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> section in this
manual.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.  The tuning server parameters section includes
information of how to optimise these. Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE>
is deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--var=option</CODE> on its own.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

In MySQL 4.0.2 one can set a variable directly with
<CODE>--variable-name=option</CODE> and <CODE>set-variable</CODE> is not anymore needed
in option files.

If you want to restrict the maximum value a startup option can be set to
with <CODE>SET</CODE>, you can define this by using the
<CODE>--maximum-variable-name</CODE> command line option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Note that when setting a variable to a value, MySQL may automatically
correct it to stay within a given range and also adjusts the value a
little to fix for the used algorithm.

<DT><CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>
<DD>
Skip some optimise stages.

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option, the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command returns only those
databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
From version 4.0.2 this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(the option is enabled by default) as we now have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, a user can't create new users with the GRANT
command, if the user doesn't have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege to the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table or any column in this table.

<DT><CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE>
<DD>
Disable usage of BDB tables. This will save memory and may speed up some
things.

<DT><CODE>--skip-concurrent-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Turn off the ability to select and insert at the same time on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables. (This is only to be used if you think you have found a bug in this
feature.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-delay-key-write; In MySQL 4.0.3 you should use --delay-key-write=OFF instead.</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option for all tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all.  This
gives everyone <STRONG>full access</STRONG> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>
<DD>
Never use host name cache for faster name-ip resolution, but query DNS server
on every connect instead.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE>
<DD>
Disable usage of Innodb tables.  This will save memory and disk space and
speed up some things.

<DT><CODE>--skip-external-locking (was --skip-locking)</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use system locking.  To use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> you must
shut down the server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Stability">1.2.3  How Stable Is MySQL?</A>.  Note that in MySQL Version
3.23 you can use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>CHECK</CODE> to repair/check <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant tables
must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't listen for TCP/IP connections at all.  All interaction with
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via Unix sockets.  This option is highly
recommended for systems where only local requests are allowed.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-new</CODE>
<DD>
Don't use new, possible wrong routines.

<DT><CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
<DD>
Don't delete or rename files that a symlinked file in the data directory
points to.

<DT><CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE>
<DD>
If MySQL is configured with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, all programs
will check the memory for overruns for every memory allocation and memory
freeing.  As this checking is very slow, you can avoid this, when you don't
need memory checking, by using this option.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command, unless the user has the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. From version 4.0.2 you should no longer
need this option, since access can now be granted specifically with the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege.

<DT><CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write stack traces.  This option is useful when you are running
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> under a debugger. On some systems you also have to use
this option to get a core file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-thread-priority</CODE>
<DD>
Disable using thread priorities for faster response time.

<DT><CODE>--socket=path</CODE>
<DD>
Socket file to use for local connections instead of default
<CODE>/tmp/mysql.sock</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--sql-mode=option[,option[,option...]]</CODE>
<DD>
Option can be any combination of: <CODE>REAL_AS_FLOAT</CODE>,
<CODE>PIPES_AS_CONCAT</CODE>, <CODE>ANSI_QUOTES</CODE>, <CODE>IGNORE_SPACE</CODE>,
<CODE>SERIALIZE</CODE>, <CODE>ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY</CODE>.  It can also be empty
(<CODE>""</CODE>) if you want to reset this.

By specifying all of the above options is same as using --ansi.
With this option one can turn on only needed SQL modes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<DT><CODE>--temp-pool</CODE>
<DD>
Using this option will cause most temporary files created to use a small
set of names, rather than a unique name for each new file. This is to
work around a problem in the Linux kernel dealing with creating a bunch
of new files with different names. With the old behaviour, Linux seems to
'leak' memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache
instead of the disk cache.

<DT><CODE>--transaction-isolation= { READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE }</CODE>
<DD>
Sets the default transaction isolation level.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_TRANSACTION">6.7.3  <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-t, --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path for temporary files. It may be useful if your default <CODE>/tmp</CODE>
directory resides on a partition too small to hold temporary tables.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, this option accepts several paths separated
by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They will be used
in round-robin fashion.

<DT><CODE>-u, --user= [user_name | userid]</CODE>
<DD>
Run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon as user <CODE>user_name</CODE> or <CODE>userid</CODE> (numeric).
This option is <STRONG>mandatory</STRONG> when starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root.

Starting from MySQL 3.23.56 and 4.0.12:

To avoid a possible security hole where a user adds an <CODE>--user=root</CODE>
option to some <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will only use the first
<CODE>--user</CODE> option specified and give a warning if there are multiple
options. Note that <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> and <TT>`datadir/my.cnf'</TT> may override
a command line option - therefore it is recommended to put this option in
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-W, --log-warnings  (Was --warnings)</CODE>
<DD>
Print out warnings like <CODE>Aborted connection...</CODE> to the <TT>`.err'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Communication_errors">A.2.9  Communication Errors / Aborted Connection</A>.
</DL>

<CODE>DATADIR</CODE> is the MySQL data directory (typically
<TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary installation or

directory that was specified at configuration time, not the one specified
with <CODE>--datadir</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up!  (<CODE>--datadir</CODE> has no
effect on where the server looks for option files, because it looks for them
before it processes any command-line arguments.)

<P>
Note that on Windows, you should specify all paths with <CODE>/</CODE> instead of

<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
MySQL tries to read option files in the order listed above.  If
multiple option files exist, an option specified in a file read later takes
precedence over the same option specified in a file read earlier.  Options
specified on the command-line take precedence over options specified in any
option file.  Some options can be specified using environment variables.
Options specified on the command-line or in option files take precedence over
environment variable values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following programs support option files:  <CODE>mysql</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>, <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, and <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Any long option that may be given on the command-line when running a MySQL
program can be given in an option file as well (without the leading double
dash).  Run the program with <CODE>--help</CODE> to get a list of available options.

</P>
<P>
An option file can contain lines of the following forms:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>#comment</CODE>
<DD>
Comment lines start with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>. Empty lines are ignored.

<DT><CODE>[group]</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>group</CODE> is the name of the program or group for which you want to set
options.  After a group line, any <CODE>option</CODE> or <CODE>set-variable</CODE> lines
apply to the named group until the end of the option file or another group
line is given.

<DT><CODE>option</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option</CODE> on the command-line.

<DT><CODE>option=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--option=value</CODE> on the command-line.

<DT><CODE>set-variable = variable=value</CODE>
<DD>
This is equivalent to <CODE>--set-variable variable=value</CODE> on the command-line.
This syntax must be used to set a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variable.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is deprecated since MySQL 4.0,
just use <CODE>--variable=value</CODE> on its own.
</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>client</CODE> group allows you to specify options that apply to all
MySQL clients (not <CODE>mysqld</CODE>). This is the perfect group to use
to specify the password you use to connect to the server.  (But make
sure the option file is readable and writable only by yourself.)

</P>
<P>
Note that for options and values, all leading and trailing blanks are
automatically deleted.  You may use the escape sequences <SAMP>`\b'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`\t'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`\s'</SAMP> in your value string

<P>
Note that the above options must be first on the command-line to work!
<CODE>--print-defaults</CODE> may however be used directly after the
<CODE>--defaults-xxx-file</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
Note for developers:  Option file handling is implemented simply by
processing all matching options (that is, options in the appropriate group)
before any command-line arguments. This works nicely for programs that use
the last instance of an option that is specified multiple times. If you have
an old program that handles multiply-specified options this way but doesn't
read option files, you need add only two lines to give it that capability.
Check the source code of any of the standard MySQL clients to see
how to do this.

</P>
<P>
In shell scripts you can use the <TT>`my_print_defaults'</TT> command to parse the
config files:

</P>

<PRE>

shell&#62; my_print_defaults client mysql
--port=3306
--socket=/tmp/mysql.sock
--no-auto-rehash
</PRE>

<P>
The above output contains all options for the groups 'client' and 'mysql'.

In some cases you may want to have many different <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemons
(servers) running on the same machine.  You may for example want to run
a new version of MySQL for testing together with an old version
that is in production.  Another case is when you want to give different
users access to different <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers that they manage themselves.

</P>
<P>
One way to get a new server running is by starting it with a different
socket and port as follows:

</P>

shell&#62; MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307
shell&#62; export MYSQL_UNIX_PORT MYSQL_TCP_PORT
shell&#62; scripts/mysql_install_db
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
The environment variables appendix includes a list of other environment
variables you can use to affect <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The above is the quick and dirty way that one commonly uses for testing.
The nice thing with this is that all connections you do in the above shell
will automatically be directed to the new running server!

</P>
<P>
If you need to do this more permanently, you should create an option
file for each server. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  In your startup script that
is executed at boot time you should specify for both servers:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>safe_mysqld --defaults-file=path-to-option-file</CODE>

</P>
<P>
At least the following options should be different per server:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>port=#

<LI>socket=path

<LI>pid-file=path

</UL>

<P>
The following options should be different, if they are used:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>log=path

<LI>log-bin=path

<LI>log-update=path

<LI>log-isam=path

<LI>bdb-logdir=path

<LI>shared-memory-base-name (New in MySQL 4.1)

</UL>

<P>
If you want more performance, you can also specify the following differently:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>tmpdir=path

<LI>bdb-tmpdir=path

</UL>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> can be set to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion. This feature can be used to
spread load between several physical disks.

</P>
<P>
If you are installing binary MySQL versions (.tar files) and
start them with <CODE>./bin/safe_mysqld</CODE> then in most cases the only
option you need to add/change is the <CODE>socket</CODE> and <CODE>port</CODE>
argument to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.

<P>
There are circumstances when you might want to run multiple servers on the same
machine.  For example, you might want to test a new MySQL release
while leaving your existing production setup undisturbed.  Or you might
be an Internet service provider that wants to provide independent
MySQL installations for different customers.

</P>
<P>
If you want to run multiple servers, the easiest way is to compile the servers
with different TCP/IP ports and socket files so they are not
both listening to the same TCP/IP port or socket file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_multi">4.7.3  <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, A Program for Managing Multiple MySQL Servers</A>.

</P>
<P>
Assume an existing server is configured for the default port number and
socket file.  Then configure the new server with a <CODE>configure</CODE> command
something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure  --with-tcp-port=port_number \
             --with-unix-socket-path=file_name \
             --prefix=/usr/local/mysql-3.22.9
</PRE>

<P>
Here <CODE>port_number</CODE> and <CODE>file_name</CODE> should be different from the
default port number and socket file pathname, and the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> value
should specify an installation directory different from the one under which
the existing MySQL installation is located.

</P>
<P>
You can check the socket used by any currently executing MySQL server
with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h hostname --port=port_number variables
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you specify ``<CODE>localhost</CODE>'' as a hostname, <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
will default to using Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.1 you can also specify the protocol to use by using the
<CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
If you have a MySQL server running on the port you used, you will
get a list of some of the most important configurable variables in
MySQL, including the socket name.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to recompile a new MySQL server just to start with
a different port and socket.  You can change the port and socket to be used
by specifying them at runtime as options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld --socket=file_name --port=port_number
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> can also take <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> (or <CODE>mysqld</CODE>)
as an argument and pass the options from a configuration file to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> and further to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you run the new server on the same database directory as another
server with logging enabled, you should also specify the name of the log
files to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log</CODE>, <CODE>--log-update</CODE>, or
<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>.  Otherwise, both servers may be trying to
write to the same log file.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: normally you should never have two servers that update
data in the same database!  If your OS doesn't support fault-free system
locking, this may lead to unpleasant surprises!

</P>
<P>
If you want to use another database directory for the second server, you
can use the <CODE>--datadir=path</CODE> option to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> also that starting several MySQL servers
(<CODE>mysqlds</CODE>) in different machines and letting them access one data
directory over <CODE>NFS</CODE> is generally a <STRONG>bad idea</STRONG>! The problem
is that the <CODE>NFS</CODE> will become the bottleneck with the speed. It is
not meant for such use. And last but not least, you would still have to
come up with a solution how to make sure that two or more <CODE>mysqlds</CODE>
are not interfering with each other. At the moment there is no platform
that would 100% reliable do the file locking (<CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon
usually) in every situation. Yet there would be one more possible risk
with <CODE>NFS</CODE>; it would make the work even more complicated for
<CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon to handle. So make it easy for your self and forget
about the idea. The working solution is to have one computer with an
operating system that efficiently handles threads and have several CPUs
in it.

</P>
<P>
When you want to connect to a MySQL server that is running with
a different port than the port that is compiled into your client, you
can use one of the following methods:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start the client with <CODE>--host 'hostname' --port=port_number</CODE> to connect
with TCP/IP, or <CODE>[--host localhost] --socket=file_name</CODE> to connect via
a Unix socket.

<LI>

Start the client with <CODE>--protocol=tcp</CODE> to connect with TCP/IP and
<CODE>--protocol=socket</CODE> to connect via a Unix socket.

<LI>

In your C or Perl programs, you can give the port or socket arguments
when connecting to the MySQL server.

<LI>

If your are using the Perl <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> module you can read the options
from the MySQL option files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.


<PRE>
$dsn = "DBI:mysql:test;mysql_read_default_group=client;
        mysql_read_default_file=/usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf"
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect($dsn, $user, $password);
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX452"></A>
Set the <CODE>MYSQL_UNIX_PORT</CODE> and <CODE>MYSQL_TCP_PORT</CODE> environment variables
to point to the Unix socket and TCP/IP port before you start your clients.
If you normally use a specific socket or port, you should place commands
to set these environment variables in your <TT>`.login'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX453"></A>

MySQL has an advanced but non-standard security/privilege
system.  This section describes how it works.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="General_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#General_security">4.2.1  General Security Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
Anyone using MySQL on a computer connected to the Internet
should read this section to avoid the most common security mistakes.

</P>
<P>
In discussing security, we emphasise the necessity of fully protecting the
entire server host (not simply the MySQL server) against all types
of applicable attacks: eavesdropping, altering, playback, and denial of
service. We do not cover all aspects of availability and fault tolerance
here.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all
connections, queries, and other operations that a user may attempt to
perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections
between MySQL clients and servers. Many of the concepts
discussed here are not specific to MySQL at all; the same
general ideas apply to almost all applications.

</P>
<P>
When running MySQL, follow these guidelines whenever possible:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>Do not ever give anyone (except the mysql root user) access to the
<CODE>user</CODE> table in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database!</STRONG>  This is critical.
<STRONG>The encrypted password is the real password in MySQL.</STRONG>
Anyone who knows the password which is listed in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
and has access to the host listed for the account <STRONG>can easily log
in as that user</STRONG>.

<LI>

Learn the MySQL access privilege system. The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands are used for controlling access to MySQL. Do
not grant any more privileges than necessary. Never grant privileges to all
hosts.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try <CODE>mysql -u root</CODE>. If you are able to connect successfully to the
server without being asked for a password, you have problems. Anyone
can connect to your MySQL server as the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user with full privileges!
Review the MySQL installation instructions, paying particular
attention to the item about setting a <CODE>root</CODE> password.
<LI>

Use the command <CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> and check to see who has access to
what. Remove those privileges that are not necessary using the <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>
command.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not keep any plain-text passwords in your database. When your
computer becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list of
passwords and use them. Instead use <CODE>MD5()</CODE>, <CODE>SHA1()</CODE> or
another one-way hashing function.
<LI>

Do not choose passwords from dictionaries. There are special programs to
break them. Even passwords like ``xfish98'' are very bad.  Much better is
``duag98'' which contains the same word ``fish'' but typed one key to the
left on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Another method is to use ``Mhall'' which
is taken from the first characters of each word in the sentence ``Mary had
a little lamb.'' This is easy to remember and type, but difficult to guess
for someone who does not know it.
<LI>

Invest in a firewall. This protects you from at least 50% of all types of
exploits in any software. Put MySQL behind the firewall or in
a demilitarised zone (DMZ).

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to scan your ports from the Internet using a tool such as
<CODE>nmap</CODE>. MySQL uses port 3306 by default. This port should
be inaccessible from untrusted hosts. Another simple way to check whether
or not your MySQL port is open is to try the following command
from some remote machine, where <CODE>server_host</CODE> is the hostname of
your MySQL server:


<PRE>
shell&#62; telnet server_host 3306
</PRE>

If you get a connection and some garbage characters, the port is
open, and should be closed on your firewall or router, unless you really
have a good reason to keep it open. If <CODE>telnet</CODE> just hangs or the
connection is refused, everything is OK; the port is blocked.
</UL>

<LI>

Do not trust any data entered by your users. They can try to trick your
code by entering special or escaped character sequences in web forms,
URLs, or whatever application you have built. Be sure that your
application remains secure if a user enters something like ``<CODE>; DROP
DATABASE mysql;</CODE>''. This is an extreme example, but large security leaks
and data loss may occur as a result of hackers using similar techniques,
if you do not prepare for them.

Also remember to check numeric data. A common mistake is to protect only
strings. Sometimes people think that if a database contains only publicly
available data that it need not be protected. This is incorrect. At least
denial-of-service type attacks can be performed on such
databases. The simplest way to protect from this type of attack is to use
apostrophes around the numeric constants: <CODE>SELECT * FROM table
WHERE ID='234'</CODE> rather than <CODE>SELECT * FROM table WHERE ID=234</CODE>.
MySQL automatically converts this string to a number and
strips all non-numeric symbols from it.

Checklist:

<UL>
<LI>

All web applications:

<UL>
<LI>

Try to enter <SAMP>`''</SAMP> and <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> in all your web forms. If you get any kind
of MySQL error, investigate the problem right away.
<LI>

Try to modify any dynamic URLs by adding <CODE>%22</CODE> (<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>), <CODE>%23</CODE>
(<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>), and <CODE>%27</CODE> (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>) in the URL.
<LI>

Try to modify datatypes in dynamic URLs from numeric ones to character
ones containing characters from previous examples. Your application
should be safe against this and similar attacks.
<LI>

Try to enter characters, spaces, and special symbols instead of numbers in
numeric fields. Your application should remove them before passing them to
MySQL or your application should generate an error. Passing
unchecked values to MySQL is very dangerous!
<LI>

Check data sizes before passing them to MySQL.
<LI>

Consider having your application connect to the database using a
different user name than the one you use for administrative purposes. Do
not give your applications any more access privileges than they need.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of PHP:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>addslashes()</CODE> function.

As of PHP 4.0.3, a <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function is available
that is based on the function of the same name in the MySQL C API.
</UL>

<LI>

Users of MySQL C API:

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> API call.

</UL>

<LI>

<UL>
<LI>Check out the <CODE>escape</CODE> and <CODE>quote</CODE> modifiers for query streams.

</UL>

</UL>

<LI>

Do not transmit plain (unencrypted) data over the Internet. These data are
accessible to everyone who has the time and ability to intercept it and use
it for their own purposes. Instead, use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or
SSH. MySQL supports internal SSL connections as of Version 4.0.0.
SSH port-forwarding can be used to create an encrypted (and compressed)
tunnel for the communication.
<LI>

Learn to use the <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> and <CODE>strings</CODE> utilities. For most cases,
you can check whether MySQL data streams are unencrypted
by issuing a command like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; tcpdump -l -i eth0 -w - src or dst port 3306 | strings
</PRE>

(This works under Linux and should work with small modifications under
other systems.)  Warning: If you do not see data this doesn't always
actually mean that it is encrypted. If you need high security, you should
consult with a security expert.

<H3><A NAME="Security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>

</P>
<P>
When you connect to a MySQL server, you normally should use a
password.  The password is not transmitted in clear text over the
connection, however the encryption algorithm is not very strong, and
with some effort a clever attacker can crack the password if he is able
to sniff the traffic between the client and the server. If the
connection between the client and the server goes through an untrusted
network, you should use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the
communication.

</P>
<P>
All other information is transferred as text that can be read by anyone
who is able to watch the connection.  If you are concerned about this,
you can use the compressed protocol (in MySQL Version 3.22 and above)
to make things much harder.  To make things even more secure you should use
<CODE>ssh</CODE>.  You can find an <CODE>Open Source</CODE> <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at
<a HREF="http://www.openssh.org/">http://www.openssh.org/</a>, and a commercial <CODE>ssh</CODE> client at
<a HREF="http://www.ssh.com/">http://www.ssh.com/</a>.  With this, you can get an encrypted TCP/IP
connection between a MySQL server and a MySQL client.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL 4.0, you can also use internal OpenSSL support.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.9  Using Secure Connections</A>.

</P>
<P>
To make a MySQL system secure, you should strongly consider the
following suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use passwords for all MySQL users. Remember that anyone can log in
as any other person as simply as <CODE>mysql -u other_user db_name</CODE> if
<CODE>other_user</CODE> has no password.  It is common behaviour with client/server
applications that the client may specify any user name.  You can change the
password of all users by editing the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script before
you run it, or only the password for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user like
this:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
    -&#62;             WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<LI>

Don't run the MySQL daemon as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user.  This is
very dangerous, because any user with the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege will be able
to create files as <CODE>root</CODE> (for example, <CODE>~root/.bashrc</CODE>). To
prevent this, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will refuse to run as <CODE>root</CODE> unless it
is specified directly using a <CODE>--user=root</CODE> option.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be run as an ordinary unprivileged user instead.
You can also create a new Unix user <CODE>mysql</CODE> to make everything
even more secure.  If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user,
you don't need to change the <CODE>root</CODE> user name in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, because MySQL user names have nothing to do with Unix
user names.  To start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as another Unix user, add a <CODE>user</CODE>
line that specifies the user name to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the
server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
user=mysql
</PRE>

This will cause the server to start as the designated user whether you
start it manually or by using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>.
For more details, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A>.

<LI>

Don't support symlinks to tables (this can be disabled with the
<CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> option). This is especially important if you run
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root as anyone that has write access to the mysqld data
directories could then delete any file in the system!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

<LI>

Check that the Unix user that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as is the only user with
read/write privileges in the database directories.

<LI>

Don't give the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege to all users.  The output of
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> shows the text of the currently executing
queries, so any user who is allowed to execute that command might be able to
see if another user issues an <CODE>UPDATE user SET
password=PASSWORD('not_secure')</CODE> query.

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> reserves an extra connection for users who have the
<CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege, so that a MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user can log
in and check things even if all normal connections are in use.

<LI>

Don't give the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege to all users.  Any user that has this
privilege can write a file anywhere in the filesystem with the privileges of
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon!  To make this a bit safer, all files generated with
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> are writeable by everyone, and you cannot
overwrite existing files.

<A NAME="IDX461"></A>

The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege may also be used to read any world readable
file that is accessible to the Unix user that the server runs as.  One can also
read any file to the current database (which the user need some privilege for).
This could be abused, for example, by using <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to load
<TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> into a table, which can then be read with
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't trust your DNS, you should use IP numbers instead of
hostnames in the grant tables. In any case, you should be very careful
about creating grant table entries using hostname values that contain
wildcards!

<LI>

If you want to restrict the number of connections for a single user, you
can do this by setting the <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE> variable in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges_options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges_options">4.2.3  Startup Options for <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Concerning Security</A></H3>

<P>
The following <CODE>mysqld</CODE> options affect security:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--local-infile[=(0|1)]</CODE>
<DD>
If one uses <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE> then one can't use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL
INFILE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
With this option, the <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command returns only those
databases for which the user has some kind of privilege.
From version 4.0.2 this option is deprecated and doesn't do anything
(the option is enabled by default) as we now have the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>--safe-user-create</CODE>
<DD>
If this is enabled, an user can't create new users with the <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
command, if the user doesn't have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege for the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table.  If you want to give a user access to just create
new users with those privileges that the user has right to grant, you should
give the user the following privilege:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT INSERT(user) ON mysql.user TO 'user'@'hostname';
</PRE>

This will ensure that the user can't change any privilege columns directly,
but has to use the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command to give privileges to other users.

<DT><CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE>
<DD>
This option causes the server not to use the privilege system at all. This
gives everyone <STRONG>full access</STRONG> to all databases!  (You can tell a running
server to start using the grant tables again by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>.)

<DT><CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>
<DD>
Hostnames are not resolved.  All <CODE>Host</CODE> column values in the grant
tables must be IP numbers or <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--skip-networking</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow TCP/IP connections over the network.  All connections to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> must be made via Unix sockets.
This option is unsuitable when using a MySQL version prior to 3.23.27 with
the MIT-pthreads package, because Unix sockets were not supported by
MIT-pthreads at that time.

<DT><CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> command, unless the user has the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege. From version 4.0.2 you should no longer
need this option, since access can now be granted specifically with the
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> privilege.

<H3><A NAME="LOAD_DATA_LOCAL" HREF="manual_toc.html#LOAD_DATA_LOCAL">4.2.4  Security issues with LOAD DATA LOCAL</A></H3>

<P>
In MySQL 3.23.49 and MySQL 4.0.2, we added some new options to deal with
possible security issues when it comes to <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There are two possible problems with supporting this command:

</P>
<P>
As the reading of the file is initiated from the server, one could
theoretically create a patched MySQL server that could read any file on
the client machine that the current user has read access to, when
the client issues a query against the table.

</P>
<P>
In a web environment where the clients are connecting from a web
server, a user could use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> to read any files
that the web server process has read access to (assuming a user could
run any command against the SQL server).

</P>
<P>
There are two separate fixes for this:

</P>
<P>
If you don't configure MySQL with <CODE>--enable-local-infile</CODE>, then
<CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> will be disabled by all clients, unless one
calls <CODE>mysql_options(... MYSQL_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE, 0)</CODE> in the client.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_options">8.4.3.163  <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
For the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client, <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> can be
enabled by specifying the option <CODE>--local-infile[=1]</CODE>, or disabled
with <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
By default, all MySQL clients and libraries are compiled with
<CODE>--enable-local-infile</CODE>, to be compatible with MySQL 3.23.48 and
before.

</P>
<P>
One can disable all <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL</CODE> commands in the MySQL server
by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In the case that <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> is disabled in the server or
the client, you will get the error message (1148):

</P>

<H3><A NAME="What_Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_Privileges">4.2.5  What the Privilege System Does</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX462"></A>
<A NAME="IDX463"></A>
<A NAME="IDX464"></A>

</P>
<P>
The primary function of the MySQL privilege system is to
authenticate a user connecting from a given host, and to associate that user
with privileges on a database such as
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Additional functionality includes the ability to have an anonymous user and
to grant privileges for MySQL-specific functions such as <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> and administrative operations.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX465"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL privilege system ensures that all users may do exactly the
things that they are supposed to be allowed to do.  When you connect to a
MySQL server, your identity is determined by <STRONG>the host from
which you connect</STRONG> and <STRONG>the user name you specify</STRONG>.  The system grants
privileges according to your identity and <STRONG>what you want to do</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL considers both your hostname and user name in identifying you
because there is little reason to assume that a given user name belongs to
the same person everywhere on the Internet.  For example, the user
<CODE>joe</CODE> who connects from <CODE>office.com</CODE> need not be the same
person as the user <CODE>joe</CODE> who connects from <CODE>elsewhere.com</CODE>.
MySQL handles this by allowing you to distinguish users on different
hosts that happen to have the same name:  you can grant <CODE>joe</CODE> one set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>office.com</CODE>, and a different set
of privileges for connections from <CODE>elsewhere.com</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL access control involves two stages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Stage 1: The server checks whether you are even allowed to connect.

<LI>

Stage 2: Assuming you can connect, the server checks each request you issue
to see whether you have sufficient privileges to perform it.  For
example, if you try to select rows from a table in a database or drop a table
from the database, the server makes sure you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
privilege for the table or the <CODE>DROP</CODE> privilege for the database.
</UL>

<P>
The server uses the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, and <CODE>host</CODE> tables in the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database at both stages of access control.  The fields in these
grant tables are shown here:

<P>
Each grant table contains scope fields and privilege fields.

</P>
<P>
Scope fields determine the scope of each entry in the tables, that is, the
context in which the entry applies.  For example, a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> values of <CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE> and
<CODE>'bob'</CODE> would be used for authenticating connections made to the server
by <CODE>bob</CODE> from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE>.  Similarly, a <CODE>db</CODE>
table entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields of
<CODE>'thomas.loc.gov'</CODE>, <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'reports'</CODE> would be used when
<CODE>bob</CODE> connects from the host <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> to access the
<CODE>reports</CODE> database.  The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables contain scope fields indicating tables or table/column combinations
to which each entry applies.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX466"></A>
For access-checking purposes, comparisons of <CODE>Host</CODE> values are
case-insensitive.  <CODE>User</CODE>, <CODE>Password</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and
<CODE>Table_name</CODE> values are case-sensitive.
<CODE>Column_name</CODE> values are case-insensitive in MySQL Version
3.22.12 or later.

</P>
<P>
Privilege fields indicate the privileges granted by a table entry, that is,
what operations can be performed.  The server combines the information in the
various grant tables to form a complete description of a user's privileges.
The rules used to do this are described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.

</TABLE>

<P>
Briefly, the server uses the grant tables like this:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields determine whether to allow or reject
incoming connections.  For allowed connections, any privileges granted in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table indicate the user's global (superuser) privileges.
These privileges apply to <STRONG>all</STRONG> databases on the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables are used together:


<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>db</CODE> table scope fields determine which users can access which
databases from which hosts.  The privilege fields determine which operations
are allowed.

<LI>

The <CODE>host</CODE> table is used as an extension of the <CODE>db</CODE> table when you
want a given <CODE>db</CODE> table entry to apply to several hosts.  For example,
if you want a user to be able to use a database from several hosts in
your network, leave the <CODE>Host</CODE> value empty in the user's <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry, then populate the <CODE>host</CODE> table with an entry for each of those
hosts.  This mechanism is described more detail in section <A HREF="manual.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables are similar to
the <CODE>db</CODE> table, but are more fine-grained: they apply at the
table and column levels rather than at the database level.
</UL>

<P>
Note that administrative privileges (<CODE>RELOAD</CODE>, <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>,
etc.) are specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  This is because
administrative operations are operations on the server itself and are not
database-specific, so there is no reason to list such privileges in the
other grant tables.  In fact, only the <CODE>user</CODE> table need
be consulted to determine whether you can perform an administrative
operation.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege is specified only in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, too.
It is not an administrative privilege as such, but your ability to read or
write files on the server host is independent of the database you are
accessing.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server reads the contents of the grant tables once, when it
starts up.  Changes to the grant tables take effect as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you modify the contents of the grant tables, it is a good idea to make
sure that your changes set up privileges the way you want.  For help in
diagnosing problems, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Access_denied">4.2.11  Causes of <CODE>Access denied</CODE> Errors</A>.  For advice on security issues,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Security">4.2.2  How to Make MySQL Secure Against Crackers</A>.

</P>
<P>
A useful
diagnostic tool is the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script, which Yves Carlier has
provided for the MySQL distribution.  Invoke <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> with
the <CODE>--help</CODE> option to find out how it works.
Note that <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> checks access using only the <CODE>user</CODE>,
<CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  It does not check table- or column-level
privileges.

The <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
privileges allow you to perform operations on rows in existing tables in
a database.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements require the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege only if they
actually retrieve rows from a table.  You can execute certain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements even without permission to access any of the databases on the
server.  For example, you could use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client as a simple
calculator:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;
mysql&#62; SELECT PI()*2;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>INDEX</CODE> privilege allows you to create or drop (remove) indexes.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege allows you to use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>CREATE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP</CODE> privileges allow you to create new
databases and tables, or to drop (remove) existing databases and tables.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you grant the <CODE>DROP</CODE> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database to a user, that user can drop the database in which the
MySQL access privileges are stored!

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows you to give to other users those
privileges you yourself possess.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege gives you permission to read and write files on
the server using the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT ... INTO
OUTFILE</CODE> statements.  Any user to whom this privilege is granted can read
any world readable file accessable by the MySQL server and create a new
world readable file in any directory where the MySQL server can write.
The user can also read any file in the current database directory.
The user can however not change any existing file.

The <CODE>reload</CODE> command tells the server to re-read the grant tables.  The
<CODE>refresh</CODE> command flushes all tables and opens and closes the log
files.  <CODE>flush-privileges</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>reload</CODE>.  The other
<CODE>flush-*</CODE> commands perform functions similar to <CODE>refresh</CODE> but are
more limited in scope, and may be preferable in some instances.  For example,
if you want to flush just the log files, <CODE>flush-logs</CODE> is a better choice
than <CODE>refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>shutdown</CODE> command shuts down the server.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>processlist</CODE> command displays information about the threads
executing within the server.  The <CODE>kill</CODE> command kills server
threads.  You can always display or kill your own threads, but you need
the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege to display and <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege to
kill threads initiated by other users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.5  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea in general to grant privileges only to those users who need
them, but you should exercise particular caution in granting certain
privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows users to give away their privileges to
other users.  Two users with different privileges and with the <CODE>GRANT</CODE>
privilege are able to combine privileges.

<LI>

The <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privilege may be used to subvert the privilege system
by renaming tables.

<LI>

The <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege can be abused to read any world-readable file
on the server or any file in the current database directory on the
server into a database table, the contents of which can then be accessed
using <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<LI>

The <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE> privilege can be abused to deny service to other
users entirely, by terminating the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege can be used to view the plain text of
currently executing queries, including queries that set or change passwords.

<LI>

Privileges on the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can be used to change passwords
and other access privilege information.  (Passwords are stored
encrypted, so a malicious user cannot simply read them to know the plain
text password.)  If they can access the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> password
column, they can use it to log into the MySQL server
for the given user.  (With sufficient privileges, the same user can
replace a password with a different one.)
</UL>

<P>
There are some things that you cannot do with the MySQL
privilege system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You cannot explicitly specify that a given user should be denied access.
That is, you cannot explicitly match a user and then refuse the connection.

<LI>

You cannot specify that a user has privileges to create or drop tables
in a database but not to create or drop the database itself.

MySQL client programs generally require that you specify connection
parameters when you want to access a MySQL server: the host you want
to connect to, your user name, and your password.  For example, the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client can be started like this (optional arguments are enclosed
between <SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql [-h host_name] [-u user_name] [-pyour_pass]
</PRE>

<P>
Alternate forms of the <CODE>-h</CODE>, <CODE>-u</CODE>, and <CODE>-p</CODE> options are
<CODE>--host=host_name</CODE>, <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE>, and
<CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE>.  Note that there is <EM>no space</EM> between
<CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password=</CODE> and the password following it.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: Specifying a password on the command-line is not secure!
Any user on your system may then find out your password by typing a command
like: <CODE>ps auxww</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> uses default values for connection parameters that are missing
from the command-line:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The default hostname is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<LI>

The default user name is your Unix login name.

<LI>

No password is supplied if <CODE>-p</CODE> is missing.
</UL>

<P>
Thus, for a Unix user <CODE>joe</CODE>, the following commands are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost -u joe
shell&#62; mysql -h localhost
shell&#62; mysql -u joe
shell&#62; mysql
</PRE>

<P>
Other MySQL clients behave similarly.

</P>
<P>
On Unix systems, you can specify different default values to be used when you
make a connection, so that you need not enter them on the command-line each
time you invoke a client program.  This can be done in a couple of ways:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
You can specify connection parameters in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the
<TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> configuration file in your home directory.  The relevant
section of the file might look like this:


<PRE>
[client]
host=host_name
user=user_name
password=your_pass
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX476"></A>
<A NAME="IDX477"></A>
<A NAME="IDX478"></A>
You can specify connection parameters using environment variables.  The
host can be specified for <CODE>mysql</CODE> using <CODE>MYSQL_HOST</CODE>.  The
MySQL user name can be specified using <CODE>USER</CODE> (this is for
Windows only).  The password can be specified using <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>
(but this is insecure; see the next section).  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.

When you attempt to connect to a MySQL server, the server accepts or
rejects the connection based on your identity and whether you can
verify your identity by supplying the correct password.  If not, the server
denies access to you completely.  Otherwise, the server accepts the
connection, then enters Stage 2 and waits for requests.

</P>
<P>
Your identity is based on two pieces of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The host from which you connect

<LI>

Your MySQL user name
</UL>

<P>
Identity checking is performed using the three <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields
(<CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>, and <CODE>Password</CODE>).  The server accepts the
connection only if a <CODE>user</CODE> table entry matches your hostname and user
name, and you supply the correct password.

</P>
<P>
Values in the <CODE>user</CODE> table scope fields may be specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value may be a hostname or an IP number, or <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>
to indicate the local host.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX483"></A>
You can use the wildcard characters <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> in the <CODE>Host</CODE>
field.

<LI>

A <CODE>Host</CODE> value of <CODE>'%'</CODE> matches any hostname.

<LI>

A blank <CODE>Host</CODE> value means that the privilege should be anded
with the entry in the <CODE>host</CODE> table that matches the given host name.
You can find more information about this in the next chapter.

<A NAME="IDX484"></A>
<LI>

As of MySQL Version 3.23, for <CODE>Host</CODE> values specified as
IP numbers, you can specify a netmask indicating how many address bits to
use for the network number. For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db.*
    -&#62; TO david@'192.58.197.0/255.255.255.0';
</PRE>

This will allow everyone to connect from an IP where the following is true:


<PRE>
user_ip &#38; netmask = host_ip.
</PRE>

In the above example all IP:s in the interval 192.58.197.0 -
192.58.197.255 can connect to the MySQL server.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX485"></A>
Wildcard characters are not allowed in the <CODE>User</CODE> field, but you can
specify a blank value, which matches any name.  If the <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry that matches an incoming connection has a blank user name, the user is
considered to be the anonymous user (the user with no name), rather than the
name that the client actually specified.  This means that a blank user name
is used for all further access checking for the duration of the connection
(that is, during Stage 2).

<LI>

The <CODE>Password</CODE> field can be blank.  This does not mean that any password
matches, it means the user must connect without specifying a password.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX486"></A>
Non-blank <CODE>Password</CODE> values represent encrypted passwords.
MySQL does not store passwords in plaintext form for anyone to
see.  Rather, the password supplied by a user who is attempting to
connect is encrypted (using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function). The
encrypted password is then used when the client/server is checking if
the password is correct. (This is done without the encrypted password
ever traveling over the connection.)  Note that from MySQL's
point of view the encrypted password is the REAL password, so you should
not give anyone access to it!  In particular, don't give normal users
read access to the tables in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database!
From version 4.1, MySQL employs a different password and login mechanism
that is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed and/or the mysql database
is captured.

</P>
<P>
The examples here show how various combinations of <CODE>Host</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE> values in <CODE>user</CODE> table entries apply to incoming
connections:

<P>
Because you can use IP wildcard values in the <CODE>Host</CODE> field (for example,
<CODE>'144.155.166.%'</CODE> to match every host on a subnet), there is the
possibility that someone might try to exploit this capability by naming a
host <CODE>144.155.166.somewhere.com</CODE>.  To foil such attempts, MySQL
disallows matching on hostnames that start with digits and a dot. Thus, if
you have a host named something like <CODE>1.2.foo.com</CODE>, its name will never
match the <CODE>Host</CODE> column of the grant tables.  Only an IP number can
match an IP wildcard value.

</P>
<P>
An incoming connection may be matched by more than one entry in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table.  For example, a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>fred</CODE> would be matched by several of the entries just shown above.  How
does the server choose which entry to use if more than one matches?  The
server resolves this question by sorting the <CODE>user</CODE> table after reading
it at startup time, then looking through the entries in sorted order when a
user attempts to connect.  The first matching entry is the one that is used.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>user</CODE> table sorting works as follows.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table
looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| %         | root     | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
When the server reads in the table, it orders the entries with the
most-specific <CODE>Host</CODE> values first (<CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
means ``any host'' and is least specific).  Entries with the same <CODE>Host</CODE>
value are ordered with the most-specific <CODE>User</CODE> values first (a blank
<CODE>User</CODE> value means ``any user'' and is least specific).  The resulting
sorted <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+-----------+----------+-
| Host      | User     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
| localhost | root     | ...
| localhost |          | ...
| %         | jeffrey  | ...
| %         | root     | ...
+-----------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX487"></A>
<A NAME="IDX488"></A>
<A NAME="IDX489"></A>
When a connection is attempted, the server looks through the sorted entries
and uses the first match found.  For a connection from <CODE>localhost</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE>, the entries with <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column
match first.  Of those, the entry with the blank user name matches both the
connecting hostname and user name.  (The <CODE>'%'/'jeffrey'</CODE> entry would
have matched, too, but it is not the first match in the table.)

</P>
<P>
Here is another example.  Suppose the <CODE>user</CODE> table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
+----------------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
The sorted table looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
+----------------+----------+-
| Host           | User     | ...
+----------------+----------+-
| thomas.loc.gov |          | ...
| %              | jeffrey  | ...
+----------------+----------+-
</PRE>

<P>
A connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the
first entry, whereas a connection from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is matched by the second.

</P>
<P>
A common misconception is to think that for a given user name, all entries
that explicitly name that user will be used first when the server attempts to
find a match for the connection.  This is simply not true.  The previous
example illustrates this, where a connection from <CODE>thomas.loc.gov</CODE> by
<CODE>jeffrey</CODE> is first matched not by the entry containing <CODE>'jeffrey'</CODE>
as the <CODE>User</CODE> field value, but by the entry with no user name!

</P>
<P>
If you have problems connecting to the server, print out the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and sort it by hand to see where the first match is being made.
If connection was successful, but your privileges are not what you
expected you may use <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> function (new in version
4.0.6) to see what user/host combination your connection actually
matched. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Request_access" HREF="manual_toc.html#Request_access">4.2.10  Access Control, Stage 2: Request Verification</A></H3>

<P>
Once you establish a connection, the server enters Stage 2.  For each request
that comes in on the connection, the server checks whether you have
sufficient privileges to perform it, based on the type of operation you wish
to perform.  This is where the privilege fields in the grant tables come into
play.  These privileges can come from any of the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>,
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>tables_priv</CODE>, or <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables.  The grant
tables are manipulated with <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  (You may find it helpful to refer to
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A>, which lists the fields present in each of the grant
tables.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>user</CODE> table grants privileges that are assigned to you on a global
basis and that apply no matter what the current database is.  For example, if
the <CODE>user</CODE> table grants you the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> privilege, you can
delete rows from any database on the server host!  In other words,
<CODE>user</CODE> table privileges are superuser privileges.  It is wise to grant
privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table only to superusers such as server or
database administrators.  For other users, you should leave the privileges
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table set to <CODE>'N'</CODE> and grant privileges on a
database-specific basis only, using the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables.

Values in the scope fields may be specified as follows:

<UL>
<LI>

The wildcard characters <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> can be used in the <CODE>Host</CODE>

the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.

<LI>

A <CODE>'%'</CODE> <CODE>Host</CODE> value in the <CODE>db</CODE> table means ``any host.'' A

<LI>

A <CODE>'%'</CODE> or blank <CODE>Host</CODE> value in the <CODE>host</CODE> table means ``any

fields, and the <CODE>host</CODE> table is sorted on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE>
scope fields.  As with the <CODE>user</CODE> table, sorting puts the most-specific
values first and least-specific values last, and when the server looks for
matching entries, it uses the first match that it finds.

wildcards or be blank in either table.
</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE> tables are sorted on
the <CODE>Host</CODE>, <CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> fields.  This is similar to
<CODE>db</CODE> table sorting, although the sorting is simpler because
only the <CODE>Host</CODE> field may contain wildcards.

The request verification process is described here.  (If you are familiar

explanation simpler.)

</P>
<P>
For administrative requests (<CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>, <CODE>RELOAD</CODE>, etc.), the
server checks only the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry, because that is the only table
that specifies administrative privileges.  Access is granted if the entry
allows the requested operation and denied otherwise.  For example, if you
want to execute <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> but your <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
doesn't grant the <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE> privilege to you, access is denied
without even checking the <CODE>db</CODE> or <CODE>host</CODE> tables.  (They
contain no <CODE>Shutdown_priv</CODE> column, so there is no need to do so.)

</P>
<P>
For database-related requests (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, etc.), the
server first checks the user's global (superuser) privileges by looking in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry.  If the entry allows the requested operation,
access is granted.  If the global privileges in the <CODE>user</CODE> table are
insufficient, the server determines the user's database-specific privileges
by checking the <CODE>db</CODE> and <CODE>host</CODE> tables:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

The server looks in the <CODE>db</CODE> table for a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE>,
<CODE>Db</CODE>, and <CODE>User</CODE> fields.  The <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE> fields are
matched to the connecting user's hostname and MySQL user name.  The
<CODE>Db</CODE> field is matched to the database the user wants to access.  If
there is no entry for the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>, access is denied.

<LI>

If there is a matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry and its <CODE>Host</CODE> field is
not blank, that entry defines the user's database-specific privileges.

<LI>

If the matching <CODE>db</CODE> table entry's <CODE>Host</CODE> field is blank, it
signifies that the <CODE>host</CODE> table enumerates which hosts should be allowed
access to the database.  In this case, a further lookup is done in the
<CODE>host</CODE> table to find a match on the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>Db</CODE> fields.
If no <CODE>host</CODE> table entry matches, access is denied.  If there is a
match, the user's database-specific privileges are computed as the
intersection (<STRONG>not</STRONG> the union!) of the privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> and
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries, that is, the privileges that are <CODE>'Y'</CODE> in both
entries.  (This way you can grant general privileges in the <CODE>db</CODE> table
entry and then selectively restrict them on a host-by-host basis using the
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries.)
</OL>

<P>
After determining the database-specific privileges granted by the <CODE>db</CODE>
and <CODE>host</CODE> table entries, the server adds them to the global privileges
granted by the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  If the result allows the requested
operation, access is granted.  Otherwise, the server checks the user's
table and column privileges in the <CODE>tables_priv</CODE> and <CODE>columns_priv</CODE>
tables and adds those to the user's privileges.  Access is allowed or denied
based on the result.

</P>
<P>
Expressed in boolean terms, the preceding description of how a user's
privileges are calculated may be summarised like this:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
It may not be apparent why, if the global <CODE>user</CODE> entry privileges are
initially found to be insufficient for the requested operation, the server
adds those privileges to the database-, table-, and column-specific privileges
later. The reason is that a request might require more than one type of
privilege.  For example, if you execute an <CODE>INSERT ...  SELECT</CODE>
statement, you need both <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privileges.
Your privileges might be such that the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry grants one
privilege and the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry grants the other.  In this case, you
have the necessary privileges to perform the request, but the server cannot
tell that from either table by itself; the privileges granted by the entries
in both tables must be combined.

After installing MySQL, did you run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>

you have a file <TT>`user.MYD'</TT> in the MySQL database directory.
Ordinarily, this is <TT>`PATH/var/mysql/user.MYD'</TT>, where <CODE>PATH</CODE> is the
pathname to the MySQL installation root.

<LI>

After a fresh installation, you should connect to the server and set up
your users and their access permissions:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
</PRE>

The server should let you connect because the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user
has no password initially.  That is also a security risk, so setting the
<CODE>root</CODE> password is something you should do while you're setting up
your other MySQL users.

If you try to connect as <CODE>root</CODE> and get this error:


<PRE>
Access denied for user: '@unknown' to database mysql
</PRE>

this means that you don't have an entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a
<CODE>User</CODE> column value of <CODE>'root'</CODE> and that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> cannot
resolve the hostname for your client.  In this case, you must restart the
server with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option and edit your
<TT>`/etc/hosts'</TT> or <TT>`\windows\hosts'</TT> file to add an entry for your
host.

<LI>

If you get an error like the following:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx ver
Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

It means that you are using a wrong password. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.7  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

If you have forgot the root password, you can restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to change the password.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Resetting_permissions">A.4.2  How to Reset a Forgotten Root Password</A>.

If you get the above error even if you haven't specified a password,
this means that you a wrong password in some <CODE>my.ini</CODE>
file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  You can avoid using option files with the <CODE>--no-defaults</CODE> option, as follows:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin --no-defaults -u root ver
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
If you updated an existing MySQL installation from a version earlier
than Version 3.22.11 to Version 3.22.11 or later, did you run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script?  If not, do so.  The structure of
the grant tables changed with MySQL Version 3.22.11 when the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement became functional.

<LI>

If your privileges seem to have changed in the middle of a session, it may be
that a superuser has changed them.  Reloading the grant tables affects new
client connections, but it also affects existing connections as indicated in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

<LI>

If you can't get your password to work, remember that you must use
the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function if you set the password with the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> statements.  The
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function is unnecessary if you specify the password using
the <CODE>GRANT ... INDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement or the <CODE>mysqladmin
password</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Passwords">4.3.7  Setting Up Passwords</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>localhost</CODE> is a synonym for your local hostname, and is also the
default host to which clients try to connect if you specify no host
explicitly.  However, connections to <CODE>localhost</CODE> do not work if you are
using a MySQL version prior to 3.23.27 that uses MIT-pthreads
(<CODE>localhost</CODE> connections are made using Unix sockets, which were not
supported by MIT-pthreads at that time).  To avoid this problem on such
systems, you should use the <CODE>--host</CODE> option to name
the server host explicitly.  This will make a TCP/IP connection to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.  In this case, you must have your real hostname in
<CODE>user</CODE> table entries on the server host.  (This is true even if you are
running a client program on the same host as the server.)

<LI>

If you get an <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error when trying to connect to the
database with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE>, you may have a problem
with the <CODE>user</CODE> table. Check this by executing <CODE>mysql -u root
mysql</CODE> and issuing this SQL statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM user;
</PRE>

The result should include an entry with the <CODE>Host</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>
columns matching your computer's hostname and your MySQL user name.

<LI>

The <CODE>Access denied</CODE> error message will tell you who you are trying
to log in as, the host from which you are trying to connect, and whether
or not you were using a password. Normally, you should have one entry in
the <CODE>user</CODE> table that exactly matches the hostname and user name
that were given in the error message. For example if you get an error
message that contains <CODE>Using password: NO</CODE>, this means that you
tried to login without an password.

<LI>

If you get the following error when you try to connect from a different host
than the one on which the MySQL server is running, then there is no
row in the <CODE>user</CODE> table that matches that host:


<PRE>
Host ... is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server
</PRE>

You can fix this by using the command-line tool <CODE>mysql</CODE> (on the
server host!) to add a row to the <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>db</CODE>, or <CODE>host</CODE>
table for the user/hostname combination from which you are trying to
connect and then execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE>.  If you are
not running MySQL Version 3.22 and you don't know the IP number or
hostname of the machine from which you are connecting, you should put an
entry with <CODE>'%'</CODE> as the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--log</CODE> option on the
server machine.  After trying to connect from the client machine, the
information in the MySQL log will indicate how you really did
connect.  (Then replace the <CODE>'%'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table entry
with the actual hostname that shows up in the log.  Otherwise, you'll
have a system that is insecure.)

Another reason for this error on Linux is that you are using a binary
MySQL version that is compiled with a different glibc version
than the one you are using.  In this case you should either upgrade your
OS/glibc or download the source MySQL version and compile this
yourself.  A source RPM is normally trivial to compile and install, so
this isn't a big problem.

<LI>

If you get an error message where the hostname is not shown or where the
hostname is an IP, even if you try to connect with a hostname:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root -pxxxx -h some-hostname ver
Access denied for user: 'root@' (Using password: YES)
</PRE>

This means that MySQL got some error when trying to resolve the
IP to a hostname.  In this case you can execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE> to reset the internal DNS cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DNS">5.5.5  How MySQL uses DNS</A>.

Some permanent solutions are:


<UL>
<LI>

Try to find out what is wrong with your DNS server and fix this.

<LI>

Specify IPs instead of hostnames in the MySQL privilege tables.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>.

<LI>

Connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> if you are running the server and the client
on the same machine.

<LI>

Put the client machine names in <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u root test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -h your_hostname -u root
test</CODE> results in <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, then you may not have the correct name
for your host in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  A common problem here is that the
<CODE>Host</CODE> value in the user table entry specifies an unqualified hostname,
but your system's name resolution routines return a fully qualified domain
name (or vice-versa).  For example, if you have an entry with host
<CODE>'tcx'</CODE> in the <CODE>user</CODE> table, but your DNS tells MySQL that
your hostname is <CODE>'tcx.subnet.se'</CODE>, the entry will not work. Try adding
an entry to the <CODE>user</CODE> table that contains the IP number of your host as
the <CODE>Host</CODE> column value.  (Alternatively, you could add an entry to the
<CODE>user</CODE> table with a <CODE>Host</CODE> value that contains a wildcard--for
example, <CODE>'tcx.%'</CODE>.  However, use of hostnames ending with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is
<STRONG>insecure</STRONG> and is <STRONG>not</STRONG> recommended!)

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name test</CODE> works but <CODE>mysql -u user_name
other_db_name</CODE> doesn't work, you don't have an entry for <CODE>other_db_name</CODE>
listed in the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> works when executed on the server
machine, but <CODE>mysql -u host_name -u user_name db_name</CODE> doesn't work when
executed on another client machine, you don't have the client machine listed
in the <CODE>user</CODE> table or the <CODE>db</CODE> table.

<LI>

If you can't figure out why you get <CODE>Access denied</CODE>, remove from the
<CODE>user</CODE> table all entries that have <CODE>Host</CODE> values containing
wildcards (entries that contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>).  A very common error
is to insert a new entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'%'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some user'</CODE>, thinking that this will allow you to specify
<CODE>localhost</CODE> to connect from the same machine.  The reason that this
doesn't work is that the default privileges include an entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.  Because that entry
has a <CODE>Host</CODE> value <CODE>'localhost'</CODE> that is more specific than
<CODE>'%'</CODE>, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from
<CODE>localhost</CODE>!  The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with
<CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and <CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>'some_user'</CODE>, or to
remove the entry with <CODE>Host</CODE>=<CODE>'localhost'</CODE> and
<CODE>User</CODE>=<CODE>''</CODE>.

<LI>

If you get the following error, you may have a problem with the <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table:


<PRE>
Access to database denied
</PRE>

If the entry selected from the <CODE>db</CODE> table has an empty value in the
<CODE>Host</CODE> column, make sure there are one or more corresponding entries in
the <CODE>host</CODE> table specifying which hosts the <CODE>db</CODE> table entry
applies to.

If you get the error when using the SQL commands <CODE>SELECT ...
INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, your entry in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
probably doesn't have the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege enabled.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX506"></A>
<A NAME="IDX507"></A>
<A NAME="IDX508"></A>
Remember that client programs will use connection parameters specified
in configuration files or environment variables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.  If a client seems to be sending the wrong default
connection parameters when you don't specify them on the command-line,
check your environment and the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your home
directory.  You might also check the system-wide MySQL
configuration files, though it is far less likely that client connection
parameters will be specified there. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  If you get
<CODE>Access denied</CODE> when you run a client without any options, make
sure you haven't specified an old password in any of your option files!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<LI>

If you make changes to the grant tables directly (using an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement) and your changes seem to be ignored, remember
that you must issue a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or execute a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> command to cause the server to re-read
the privilege tables. Otherwise, your changes have no effect until the
next time the server is restarted.  Remember that after you set the
<CODE>root</CODE> password with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> command, you won't need to
specify it until after you flush the privileges, because the server
won't know you've changed the password yet!

<LI>

If you have access problems with a Perl, PHP, Python, or ODBC program, try to
connect to the server with <CODE>mysql -u user_name db_name</CODE> or <CODE>mysql
-u user_name -pyour_pass db_name</CODE>.  If you are able to connect using the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> client, there is a problem with your program and not with the
access privileges.  (Note that there is no space between <CODE>-p</CODE> and the
password; you can also use the <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> syntax to specify
the password. If you use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option alone, MySQL will
prompt you for the password.)

<LI>

For testing, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with the
<CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  Then you can change the MySQL
grant tables and use the <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE> script to check whether
your modifications have the desired effect.  When you are satisfied with your
changes, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server to start using the new grant tables.  <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: reloading the
grant tables overrides the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  This allows
you to tell the server to begin using the grant tables again without bringing
it down and restarting it.

<LI>

If everything else fails, start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with a debugging
option (for example, <CODE>--debug=d,general,query</CODE>). This will print host and
user information about attempted connections, as well as information about
each command issued. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

<LI>

If you have any other problems with the MySQL grant tables and
feel you must post the problem to the mailing list, always provide a
dump of the MySQL grant tables. You can dump the tables with
the <CODE>mysqldump mysql</CODE> command. As always, post your problem using
the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.  In some cases you may need
to restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> to run
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>.

<P>
<CODE>USAGE</CODE> can be used when you want to create a user that has no privileges.

</P>
<P>
The privileges <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>EXECUTE</CODE>,
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>REPLICATION ...</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> and
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> are new for in version 4.0.2.  To use these new privileges
after upgrading to 4.0.2, you have to run the
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> script.

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions, the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege gives the same
rights as the new <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

</P>
<P>
To revoke the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege from a user, use a <CODE>priv_type</CODE>
value of <CODE>GRANT OPTION</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; REVOKE GRANT OPTION ON ... FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a table are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>,
<CODE>GRANT OPTION</CODE>, <CODE>INDEX</CODE>, and <CODE>ALTER</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The only <CODE>priv_type</CODE> values you can specify for a column (that is, when
you use a <CODE>column_list</CODE> clause) are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can set global privileges by using <CODE>ON *.*</CODE> syntax.  You can set
database privileges by using <CODE>ON db_name.*</CODE> syntax. If you specify
<CODE>ON *</CODE> and you have a current database, you will set the privileges for
that database.  (<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: if you specify <CODE>ON *</CODE> and you
<STRONG>don't</STRONG> have a current database, you will affect the global privileges!)

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Please note</STRONG>: the <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> wildcards are allowed when
specifying database names in <CODE>GRANT</CODE> commands. This means that if you
wish to use for instance a <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> character as part of a database name,
you should specify it as <SAMP>`\_'</SAMP> in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> command, to prevent
the user from being able to access additional databases matching the
wildcard pattern, e.g., <CODE>GRANT ... ON `foo\_bar`.* TO ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In order to accommodate granting rights to users from arbitrary hosts,
MySQL supports specifying the <CODE>user_name</CODE> value in the form
<CODE>user@host</CODE>.  If you want to specify a <CODE>user</CODE> string
containing special characters (such as <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>), or a <CODE>host</CODE> string
containing special characters or wildcard characters (such as <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>), you
can quote the user or host name (for example, <CODE>'test-user'@'test-hostname'</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
You can specify wildcards in the hostname.  For example,
<CODE>user@'%.loc.gov'</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE> for any host in the
<CODE>loc.gov</CODE> domain, and <CODE>user@'144.155.166.%'</CODE> applies to <CODE>user</CODE>
for any host in the <CODE>144.155.166</CODE> class C subnet.

</P>
<P>
The simple form <CODE>user</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>user@"%"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't support wildcards in user names.  Anonymous users are
defined by inserting entries with <CODE>User=''</CODE> into the
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table or creating an user with an empty name with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: if you allow anonymous users to connect to the MySQL
server, you should also grant privileges to all local users as
<CODE>user@localhost</CODE> because otherwise the anonymous user entry for
the local host in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table will be used when the user
tries to log into the MySQL server from the local machine!

</P>
<P>
You can verify if this applies to you by executing this query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT Host,User FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
</PRE>

<P>
For the moment, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> only supports host, table, database, and
column names up to 60 characters long. A user name can be up to 16
characters.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a table or column are formed from the
logical OR of the privileges at each of the four privilege
levels.  For example, if the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table specifies that a
user has a global <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege, this can't be denied by an
entry at the database, table, or column level.

</P>
<P>
The privileges for a column can be calculated as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
global privileges
OR (database privileges AND host privileges)
OR table privileges
OR column privileges
</PRE>

<P>
In most cases, you grant rights to a user at only one of the privilege
levels, so life isn't normally as complicated as above. The details of the
privilege-checking procedure are presented in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_system">4.2  General Security Issues and the MySQL Access Privilege System</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a user/hostname combination that does not exist
in the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table, an entry is added and remains there until
deleted with a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command.  In other words, <CODE>GRANT</CODE> may
create <CODE>user</CODE> table entries, but <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> will not remove them;
you must do that explicitly using <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX516"></A>
In MySQL Version 3.22.12 or later,
if a new user is created or if you have global grant privileges, the user's
password will be set to the password specified by the <CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE>
clause, if one is given.  If the user already had a password, it is replaced
by the new one.

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to send the password in clear text you can use the
<CODE>PASSWORD</CODE> option followed by a scrambled password from SQL
function <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> or the C API function
<CODE>make_scrambled_password(char *to, const char *password)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: if you create a new user but do not specify an
<CODE>IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> clause, the user has no password.  This is insecure.

</P>
<P>
Passwords can also be set with the <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you grant privileges for a database, an entry in the <CODE>mysql.db</CODE>
table is created if needed. When all privileges for the database have been
removed with <CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, this entry is deleted.

</P>
<P>
If a user doesn't have any privileges on a table, the table is not displayed
when the user requests a list of tables (for example, with a <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE>
statement).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE> clause gives the user the ability to give
to other users any privileges the user has at the specified privilege level.
You should be careful to whom you give the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege, as two
users with different privileges may be able to join privileges!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR #</CODE>, <CODE>MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR #</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR #</CODE> are new in MySQL version 4.0.2.
These options limit the number of queries/updates and logins the user can
do during one hour. If <CODE>#</CODE> is 0 (default), then this means that there
are no limitations for that user. See section <A HREF="manual.html#User_resources">4.3.6  Limiting user resources</A>.
Note: to specify any of these options for an existing user without adding
other additional privileges, use <CODE>GRANT USAGE ... WITH MAX_...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You cannot grant another user a privilege you don't have yourself;
the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege allows you to give away only those privileges
you possess.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that when you grant a user the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege at a
particular privilege level, any privileges the user already possesses (or
is given in the future!) at that level are also grantable by that user.
Suppose you grant a user the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on a database.  If
you then grant the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege on the database and specify
<CODE>WITH GRANT OPTION</CODE>, the user can give away not only the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
privilege, but also <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.  If you then grant the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
privilege to the user on the database, the user can give away the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should not grant <CODE>ALTER</CODE> privileges to a normal user.  If you
do that, the user can try to subvert the privilege system by renaming
tables!

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using table or column privileges for even one user, the
server examines table and column privileges for all users and this will slow
down MySQL a bit.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all privileges are read into memory.
Database, table, and column privileges take effect at once, and
user-level privileges take effect the next time the user connects.
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> or
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> to tell the server to reload the grant
tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX517"></A>
The biggest differences between the ANSI SQL and MySQL versions of
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In MySQL privileges are given for an username + hostname combination
and not only for an username.

<LI>

ANSI SQL doesn't have global or database-level privileges, and ANSI SQL
doesn't support all privilege types that MySQL supports.
MySQL doesn't support the ANSI SQL <CODE>TRIGGER</CODE> or <CODE>UNDER</CODE>
privileges.

<LI>

ANSI SQL privileges are structured in a hierarchal manner. If you remove
an user, all privileges the user has granted are revoked. In
MySQL the granted privileges are not automatically revoked, but
you have to revoke these yourself if needed.

<LI>

In MySQL, if you have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on only some of the
columns in a table, you can execute <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements on the
table; the columns for which you don't have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege
will be set to their default values. ANSI SQL requires you to have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege on all columns.

<LI>

When you drop a table in ANSI SQL, all privileges for the table are revoked.
If you revoke a privilege in ANSI SQL, all privileges that were granted based
on this privilege are also revoked. In MySQL, privileges can be
dropped only with explicit <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> commands or by manipulating the
MySQL grant tables.
</UL>

<P>
For a description of using <CODE>REQUIRE</CODE>, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.9  Using Secure Connections</A>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="User_names" HREF="manual_toc.html#User_names">4.3.2  MySQL User Names and Passwords</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX518"></A>
<A NAME="IDX519"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are several distinctions between the way user names and passwords are
used by MySQL and the way they are used by Unix or Windows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User names, as used by MySQL for authentication purposes, have
nothing to do with Unix user names (login names) or Windows user names.  Most
MySQL clients by default try to log in using the current Unix user
name as the MySQL user name, but that is for convenience only.
Client programs allow a different name to be specified with the <CODE>-u</CODE> or
<CODE>--user</CODE> options. This means that you can't make a database secure in
any way unless all MySQL user names have passwords.  Anyone may
attempt to connect to the server using any name, and they will succeed if
they specify any name that doesn't have a password.

<LI>

MySQL user names can be up to 16 characters long; Unix user names
typically are limited to 8 characters.

<LI>

MySQL passwords have nothing to do with Unix passwords.  There is no
necessary connection between the password you use to log in to a Unix machine
and the password you use to access a database on that machine.

<LI>

MySQL encrypts passwords using a different algorithm than the
one used during the Unix login process.  See the descriptions of the
<CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> and <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> functions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.  Note that even if the password is stored 'scrambled', and
knowing your 'scrambled' password is enough to be able to connect to
the MySQL server!
From version 4.1, MySQL employs a different password and login mechanism
that is secure even if TCP/IP packets are sniffed and/or the mysql
database is captured.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL users and their privileges are normally created with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you login to a MySQL server with a command-line client you
should specify the password with <CODE>--password=your-password</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Connecting">4.2.8  Connecting to the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password=guess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
If you want the client to prompt for a password, you should use
<CODE>--password</CODE> without any argument

</P>

<PRE>
mysql --user=monty --password database_name
</PRE>

<P>
or the short form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -p database_name
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in the last example the password is <STRONG>not</STRONG> 'database_name'.

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the <CODE>-p</CODE> option to supply a password you should do so
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -u monty -pguess database_name
</PRE>

<P>
On some systems, the library call that MySQL uses to prompt for a
password will automatically cut the password to 8 characters. Internally
MySQL doesn't have any limit for the length of the password.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Privilege_changes" HREF="manual_toc.html#Privilege_changes">4.3.3  When Privilege Changes Take Effect</A></H3>

<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all grant table contents are read into memory and
become effective at that point.

</P>
<P>
Modifications to the grant tables that you perform using <CODE>GRANT</CODE>,
<CODE>REVOKE</CODE>, or <CODE>SET PASSWORD</CODE> are noticed by the server immediately.

</P>
<P>
If you modify the grant tables manually (using <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
etc.), you should execute a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> statement or run
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-privileges</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE> to tell the
server to reload the grant tables. Otherwise, your changes will have <EM>no
effect</EM> until you restart the server. If you change the grant tables manually
but forget to reload the privileges, you will be wondering why your changes
don't seem to make any difference!

</P>
<P>
When the server notices that the grant tables have been changed,
existing client connections are affected as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Table and column privilege changes take effect with the client's next
request.

<LI>

Database privilege changes take effect at the next <CODE>USE db_name</CODE>
command.

<LI>

Global privilege changes and password changes take effect the next time
the client connects.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Default_privileges" HREF="manual_toc.html#Default_privileges">4.3.4  Setting Up the Initial MySQL Privileges</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX520"></A>
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>

</P>
<P>
After installing MySQL, you set up the initial access privileges by
running <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Quick_install">2.3.1  Quick Installation Overview</A>.
The <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script starts up the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
server, then initialises the grant tables to contain the following set
of privileges:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user is created as a superuser who can do
anything.  Connections must be made from the local host.

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>:
The initial <CODE>root</CODE> password is empty, so anyone can connect as <CODE>root</CODE>
<EM>without a password</EM> and be granted all privileges.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
An anonymous user is created that can do anything with databases that have a
name of <CODE>'test'</CODE> or starting with <CODE>'test_'</CODE>.  Connections must be
made from the local host.  This means any local user can connect without a
password and be treated as the anonymous user.

<LI>

Other privileges are denied.  For example, normal users can't use
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: the default privileges are different for Windows.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_running">2.6.2.3  Running MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Because your installation is initially wide open, one of the first things you
should do is specify a password for the MySQL
<CODE>root</CODE> user.  You can do this as follows (note that you specify the
password using the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD('new_password');
</PRE>

<P>
If you know what you are doing, you can also directly manipulate the
privilege tables:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
    -&#62;     WHERE user='root';
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
Another way to set the password is by using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u root password new_password
</PRE>

<P>
Only users with write/update access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can change the
password for others users.  All normal users (not anonymous ones) can only
change their own password with either of the above commands or with
<CODE>SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('new password')</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you update the password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table directly using
the first method, you must tell the server to re-read the grant tables (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>), because the change will go unnoticed otherwise.

</P>
<P>
Once the <CODE>root</CODE> password has been set, thereafter you must supply that
password when you connect to the server as <CODE>root</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You may wish to leave the <CODE>root</CODE> password blank so that you don't need
to specify it while you perform additional setup or testing. However, be sure
to set it before using your installation for any real production work.

</P>
<P>
See the <CODE>scripts/mysql_install_db</CODE> script to see how it sets up
the default privileges.  You can use this as a basis to see how to
add other users.

</P>
<P>
If you want the initial privileges to be different from those just described
above, you can modify <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> before you run it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
To re-create the grant tables completely, remove all the <TT>`.frm'</TT>,
<TT>`.MYI'</TT>, and <TT>`.MYD'</TT> files in the directory containing the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  (This is the directory named <TT>`mysql'</TT> under
the database directory, which is listed when you run <CODE>mysqld
--help</CODE>.) Then run the <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> script, possibly after
editing it first to have the privileges you want.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: for MySQL versions older than Version 3.22.10,
you should not delete the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files.  If you accidentally do this,
you should copy them back from your MySQL distribution before
running <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can add users two different ways: by using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements
or by manipulating the MySQL grant tables directly.  The
preferred method is to use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, because they are
more concise and less error-prone. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are also a lot of contributed programs like <CODE>phpmyadmin</CODE>
that can be used to create and administrate users.

</P>
<P>
The following examples show how to use the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client to set up new
users.  These examples assume that privileges are set up according to the
defaults described in the previous section.  This means that to make changes,
you must be on the same machine where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must
connect as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user, and the <CODE>root</CODE> user must
have the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> privilege for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database and the
<CODE>RELOAD</CODE> administrative privilege.  Also, if you have changed the
<CODE>root</CODE> user password, you must specify it for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> commands here.

</P>
<P>
You can add new users by issuing <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@localhost
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO monty@"%"
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&#62; GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO admin@localhost;
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO dummy@localhost;
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements set up three new users:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>monty</CODE>
<DD>
A full superuser who can connect to the server from anywhere, but who must
use a password <CODE>'some_pass'</CODE> to do so.  Note that we must issue
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements for both <CODE>monty@localhost</CODE> and
<CODE>monty@"%"</CODE>.  If we don't add the entry with <CODE>localhost</CODE>, the
anonymous user entry for <CODE>localhost</CODE> that is created by
<CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> will take precedence when we connect from the local
host, because it has a more specific <CODE>Host</CODE> field value and thus comes
earlier in the <CODE>user</CODE> table sort order.

<DT><CODE>admin</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect from <CODE>localhost</CODE> without a password and who is
granted the <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> and <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> administrative privileges.
This allows the user to execute the <CODE>mysqladmin reload</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, and <CODE>mysqladmin flush-*</CODE> commands, as well as
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> .  No database-related privileges are granted.
(They can be granted later by issuing additional <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements.)

<DT><CODE>dummy</CODE>
<DD>
A user who can connect without a password, but only from the local host.  The
global privileges are all set to <CODE>'N'</CODE>@-the <CODE>USAGE</CODE> privilege
type allows you to create a user with no privileges.  It is assumed that you
will grant database-specific privileges later.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
<A NAME="IDX536"></A>
You can also add the same user access information directly by issuing
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements and then telling the server to reload the grant
tables:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('localhost','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    -&#62;          'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES('%','monty',PASSWORD('some_pass'),
    -&#62;          'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user SET Host='localhost',User='admin',
    -&#62;           Reload_priv='Y', Process_priv='Y';
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62;                  VALUES('localhost','dummy','');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
Depending on your MySQL version, you may have to use a different
number of <CODE>'Y'</CODE> values above (versions prior to Version 3.22.11 had fewer
privilege columns).  For the <CODE>admin</CODE> user, the more readable extended
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax that is available starting with Version 3.22.11 is used.

</P>
<P>
Note that to set up a superuser, you need only create a <CODE>user</CODE> table
entry with the privilege fields set to <CODE>'Y'</CODE>.  No <CODE>db</CODE> or
<CODE>host</CODE> table entries are necessary.

</P>
<P>
The privilege columns in the <CODE>user</CODE> table were not set explicitly in the
last <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (for the <CODE>dummy</CODE> user), so those columns
are assigned the default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>.  This is the same thing that
<CODE>GRANT USAGE</CODE> does.

</P>
<P>
The following example adds a user <CODE>custom</CODE> who can connect from hosts
<CODE>localhost</CODE>, <CODE>server.domain</CODE>, and <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>.  He wants
to access the <CODE>bankaccount</CODE> database only from <CODE>localhost</CODE>,
the <CODE>expenses</CODE> database only from <CODE>whitehouse.gov</CODE>, and
the <CODE>customer</CODE> database from all three hosts.  He wants
to use the password <CODE>stupid</CODE> from all three hosts.

</P>
<P>
To set up this user's privileges using <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements, run these
commands:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON bankaccount.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@localhost
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON expenses.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@whitehouse.gov
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
mysql&#62; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP
    -&#62;     ON customer.*
    -&#62;     TO custom@'%'
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'stupid';
</PRE>

<P>
The reason that we do to grant statements for the user 'custom' is that
we want the give the user access to MySQL both from the local
machine with Unix sockets and from the remote machine 'whitehouse.gov'
over TCP/IP.

</P>
<P>
To set up the user's privileges by modifying the grant tables directly,
run these commands (note the <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> at the end):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --user=root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('localhost','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('server.domain','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('whitehouse.gov','custom',PASSWORD('stupid'));
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES
    -&#62; ('localhost','bankaccount','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES
    -&#62; ('whitehouse.gov','expenses','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO db
    -&#62; (Host,Db,User,Select_priv,Insert_priv,Update_priv,Delete_priv,
    -&#62;  Create_priv,Drop_priv)
    -&#62; VALUES('%','customer','custom','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
The first three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add <CODE>user</CODE> table entries that
allow user <CODE>custom</CODE> to connect from the various hosts with the given
password, but grant no permissions to him (all privileges are set to the
default value of <CODE>'N'</CODE>).  The next three <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements add
<CODE>db</CODE> table entries that grant privileges to <CODE>custom</CODE> for the
<CODE>bankaccount</CODE>, <CODE>expenses</CODE>, and <CODE>customer</CODE> databases, but only
when accessed from the proper hosts.  As usual, when the grant tables are
modified directly, the server must be told to reload them (with
<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE>) so that the privilege changes take effect.

</P>
<P>
If you want to give a specific user access from any machine in a given
domain, you can issue a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT ...
    -&#62;     ON *.*
    -&#62;     TO myusername@"%.mydomainname.com"
    -&#62;     IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
</PRE>

<P>
To do the same thing by modifying the grant tables directly, do this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user VALUES ('%.mydomainname.com', 'myusername',
    -&#62;             PASSWORD('mypassword'),...);
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="User_resources" HREF="manual_toc.html#User_resources">4.3.6  Limiting user resources</A></H3>

<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.2 one can limit certain resources per user.

</P>
<P>
So far, the only available method of limiting usage of MySQL
server resources has been setting the <CODE>max_user_connections</CODE>
startup variable to a non-zero value. But this method is strictly
global and does not allow for management of individual users, which
could be of particular interest to Internet Service Providers.

</P>
<P>
Therefore, management of three resources is introduced on the
individual user level:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Number of all queries per hour:

All commands that could be run by a user.
<LI>Number of all updates per hour:

Any command that changes any table or database.
<LI>Number of connections made per hour:

New connections opened per hour.
</UL>

<P>
A user in the aforementioned context is a single entry in the
<CODE>user</CODE> table, which is uniquely identified by its <CODE>user</CODE>
and <CODE>host</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
All users are by default not limited in using the above resources,
unless the limits are granted to them. These limits can be granted
<STRONG>only</STRONG> via global <CODE>GRANT (*.*)</CODE>, using this syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
GRANT ... WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR N1
               MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR N2
               MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR N3;
</PRE>

<P>
One can specify any combination of the above resources.
N1, N2 and N3 are integers and stands for count / hour.

</P>
<P>
If user reaches any of the above limits withing one hour, his
connection will be terminated or refused and the appropriate error
message shall be issued.

</P>
<P>
Current usage values for a particular user can be flushed (set to zero)
by issuing a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement with any of the above clauses,
including a <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement with the current values.

In most cases you should use <CODE>GRANT</CODE> to set up your users/passwords,
so the following only applies for advanced users. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The examples in the preceding sections illustrate an important principle:
when you store a non-empty password using <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statements, you must use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function to encrypt it.  This
is because the <CODE>user</CODE> table stores passwords in encrypted form, not as
plaintext.  If you forget that fact, you are likely to attempt to set
passwords like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root mysql
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('%','jeffrey','biscuit');
mysql&#62; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is that the plaintext value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> is stored as the
password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table.  When the user <CODE>jeffrey</CODE> attempts to
connect to the server using this password, the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client encrypts
it with <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>, generates an authentification vector
based on <STRONG>encrypted</STRONG> password and a random number,
obtained from server, and sends the result to the server.
The server uses the <CODE>password</CODE> value in the <CODE>user</CODE> table
(that is <STRONG>not encrypted</STRONG> value <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE>)
to perform the same calculations, and compares results.
The comparison fails and the server rejects the
connection:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u jeffrey -pbiscuit test
Access denied
</PRE>

<P>
Passwords must be encrypted when they are inserted in the <CODE>user</CODE>
table, so the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement should have been specified like this
instead:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password)
    -&#62; VALUES('%','jeffrey',PASSWORD('biscuit'));
</PRE>

<P>
You must also use the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function when you use <CODE>SET
PASSWORD</CODE> statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR jeffrey@"%" = PASSWORD('biscuit');
</PRE>

<P>
If you set passwords using the <CODE>GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY</CODE> statement
or the <CODE>mysqladmin password</CODE> command, the <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> function
is unnecessary.  They both take care of encrypting the password for you,
so you would specify a password of <CODE>'biscuit'</CODE> like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO jeffrey@"%" IDENTIFIED BY 'biscuit';
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -u jeffrey password biscuit
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE> is different from Unix password encryption.

<H3><A NAME="Password_security" HREF="manual_toc.html#Password_security">4.3.8  Keeping Your Password Secure</A></H3>

<P>
It is inadvisable to specify your password in a way that exposes it to
discovery by other users.  The methods you can use to specify your password
when you run client programs are listed here, along with an assessment of
the risks of each method:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Never give a normal user access to the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table. Knowing
the encrypted password for a user makes it possible to login as this
user.  The passwords are only scrambled so that one shouldn't be able to
see the real password you used (if you happen to use a similar password
with your other applications).

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-pyour_pass</CODE> or <CODE>--password=your_pass</CODE> option on the command
line.  This is convenient but insecure, because your password becomes visible
to system status programs (such as <CODE>ps</CODE>) that may be invoked by other
users to display command-lines.  (MySQL clients typically overwrite
the command-line argument with zeroes during their initialisation sequence,
but there is still a brief interval during which the value is visible.)

<LI>

Use a <CODE>-p</CODE> or <CODE>--password</CODE> option (with no <CODE>your_pass</CODE> value
specified).  In this case, the client program solicits the password from
the terminal:
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u user_name -p
Enter password: ********
</PRE>

The <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> characters represent your password.

It is more secure to enter your password this way than to specify it on the
command-line because it is not visible to other users.  However, this method
of entering a password is suitable only for programs that you run
interactively.  If you want to invoke a client from a script that runs
non-interactively, there is no opportunity to enter the password from the
terminal. On some systems, you may even find that the first line of your
script is read and interpreted (incorrectly) as your password!

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
Store your password in a configuration file.  For example, you can list your
password in the <CODE>[client]</CODE> section of the <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT> file in your
home directory:


<PRE>
[client]
password=your_pass
</PRE>

If you store your password in <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>, the file should not be group or
world readable or writable.  Make sure the file's access mode is <CODE>400</CODE>
or <CODE>600</CODE>.

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.
<LI>

You can store your password in the <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE> environment variable, but
this method must be considered extremely insecure and should not be used.
Some versions of <CODE>ps</CODE> include an option to display the environment of
running processes; your password will be in plain sight for all to see if
you set <CODE>MYSQL_PWD</CODE>.  Even on systems without such a version of
<CODE>ps</CODE>, it is unwise to assume there is no other method to observe process
environments. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A>.
</UL>

<P>
All in all, the safest methods are to have the client program prompt for the
password or to specify the password in a properly protected <TT>`.my.cnf'</TT>
file.

<P>
Beginning with version 4.0.0,
MySQL has support for SSL encrypted connections. To understand how MySQL
uses SSL, it's necessary to explain some basic SSL and X509 concepts. People
who are already familiar with them can skip this part.

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL uses unencrypted connections between the client and the
server. This means that someone could watch all your traffic and look at
the data being sent or received.  They could even change the data
while it is in transit between client and server. Sometimes you need to
move information over public networks in a secure fashion; in such cases,
using an unencrypted connection is unacceptable.

</P>
<P>
SSL is a protocol that uses different encryption algorithms to ensure
that data received over a public network can be trusted. It has
mechanisms to detect any change, loss or replay of data. SSL also
incorporates algorithms to recognise and provide identity verification
using the X509 standard.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
Encryption is the way to make any kind of data unreadable. In fact,
today's practice requires many additional security elements from
encryption algorithms.  They should resist many kind of known attacks
like just messing with the order of encrypted messages or replaying data
twice.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
X509 is a standard that makes it possible to identify someone on the
Internet.  It is most commonly used in e-commerce applications. In basic
terms, there should be some company (called a ``Certificate Authority'') that
assigns electronic certificates to anyone who needs them. Certificates
rely on asymmetric encryption algorithms that have two encryption keys
(a public key and a secret key). A certificate owner can prove his identity by
showing his certificate to other party. A certificate consists of its
owner's public key. Any data encrypted with this public key can be
decrypted only using the corresponding secret key, which is held by the owner
of the certificate.

</P>
<P>
MySQL doesn't use encrypted connections by default, because doing so
would make the client/server protocol much slower. Any kind of
additional functionality requires the computer to do additional work and
encrypting data is a CPU-intensive operation that requires time and can delay
MySQL main tasks. By default MySQL is tuned to be fast as possible.

</P>
<P>
If you need more information about SSL, X509, or encryption, you should use
your favourite Internet search engine and search for keywords in which you are
interested.

To get secure connections to work with MySQL you must do the following:

<OL>
<LI>

Install the OpenSSL library. We have tested MySQL with OpenSSL 0.9.6.
<a HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>.
<LI>

Configure MySQL with <CODE>--with-vio --with-openssl</CODE>.
<LI>

If you are using an old MySQL installation, you have to update your
<CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table with some new SSL-related columns. You can do this by
running the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables.sh</CODE> script.
This is necessary if your grant tables date from a version prior to MySQL
4.0.0.

You can check if a running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server supports OpenSSL by
examining if <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_openssl'</CODE> returns <CODE>YES</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>REQUIRE ISSUER "issuer"</CODE> places a restriction on connection attempts:
The client must present a valid X509 certificate issued by CA <CODE>"issuer"</CODE>.
Using X509 certificates always implies encryption, so the <CODE>SSL</CODE> option

Because MySQL tables are stored as files, it is easy to do a
backup. To get a consistent backup, do a <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> on the
relevant tables followed by <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> for the tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.2  <CODE>LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You only need a read lock; this allows other threads to continue to
query the tables while you are making a copy of the files in the
database directory.  The <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> is needed to ensure that
the all active index pages is written to disk before you start the backup.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.56 and 4.0.12 <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> will not allow you
to overwrite existing files as this would be a security risk.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make a SQL level backup of a table, you can use
<CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE> or <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BACKUP_TABLE">4.4.2  <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

You can also simply copy all table files (<TT>`*.frm'</TT>, <TT>`*.MYD'</TT>, and

You can also do selective backups with <CODE>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'

...</CODE> To avoid duplicate records, you need a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> or a
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key in the table. The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> keyword causes old records
to be replaced with new ones when a new record duplicates an old record on
a unique key value.

If you get performance problems in making backups on your system, you can

BACKUP TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...] TO '/path/to/backup/directory'
</PRE>

<P>
Copies to the backup directory the minimum number of table files needed
to restore the table, after flushing any buffered changes to disk. Currently
works only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, copies <TT>`.frm'</TT> (definition)  and
<TT>`.MYD'</TT> (data) files. The index file can be rebuilt from those two.

</P>
<P>
Before using this command, please see section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>
<P>
During the backup, a read lock will be held for each table, one at time,
as they are being backed up. If you want to back up several tables as
a snapshot, you must first issue <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> obtaining a read
lock for each table in the group.

</P>
<P>
The command returns a table with the following columns:

</P>

Restores the table(s) from the backup that was made with
<CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE>. Existing tables will not be overwritten; if you
try to restore over an existing table, you will get an error. Restoring
will take longer than backing up due to the need to rebuild the index. The

<P>
<CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> works only on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables. On

table_name</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify any option <CODE>MEDIUM</CODE> is used.

</P>
<P>
Checks the table(s) for errors. For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables the key statistics

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Note that you can get many rows of information for each checked table. The
last row will be of <CODE>Msg_type status</CODE> and should normally be
<CODE>OK</CODE>.  If you don't get <CODE>OK</CODE>, or <CODE>Table is already up to
date</CODE> you should normally run a repair of the table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>. <CODE>Table is already up to date</CODE> means that the table the
given <CODE>TYPE</CODE> told MySQL that there wasn't any need to check the
table.

</P>
<P>
The different check types stand for the following:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>QUICK</CODE> </TD><TD> Don't scan the rows to check for wrong links.

<TR><TD><CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> </TD><TD> Do a full key lookup for all keys for each row.  This ensures that the table is 100% consistent, but will take a long time!
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
For dynamically sized <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables a started check will always
do a <CODE>MEDIUM</CODE> check. For statically sized rows we skip the row scan
for <CODE>QUICK</CODE> and <CODE>FAST</CODE> as the rows are very seldom corrupted.

</P>
<P>
You can combine check options as in:

</P>

<PRE>
CHECK TABLE test_table FAST QUICK;
</PRE>

<P>
Which would simply do a quick check on the table to see whether it was
closed properly.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: that in some case <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will change the
table!  This happens if the table is marked as 'corrupted' or 'not
closed properly' but <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> didn't find any problems in the
table.  In this case <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> will mark the table as okay.

</P>
<P>
If a table is corrupted, then it's most likely that the problem is in
the indexes and not in the data part.  All of the above check types
checks the indexes thoroughly and should thus find most errors.

</P>
<P>
If you just want to check a table that you assume is okay, you should use
no check options or the <CODE>QUICK</CODE> option. The latter should be used
when you are in a hurry and can take the very small risk that
<CODE>QUICK</CODE> didn't find an error in the datafile. (In most cases
MySQL should find, under normal usage, any error in the data
file. If this happens then the table will be marked as 'corrupted',
in which case the table can't be used until it's repaired.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>FAST</CODE> and <CODE>CHANGED</CODE> are mostly intended to be used from a
script (for example to be executed from <CODE>cron</CODE>) if you want to check your
table from time to time. In most cases you <CODE>FAST</CODE> is to be prefered
over <CODE>CHANGED</CODE>.  (The only case when it isn't is when you suspect a
bug you have found a bug in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> code.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> is only to be used after you have run a normal check but
still get strange errors from a table when MySQL tries to
update a row or find a row by key (this is very unlikely if a
normal check has succeeded!).

</P>
<P>
Some things reported by check table, can't be corrected automatically:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>Found row where the auto_increment column has the value 0</CODE>.

This means that you have in the table a row where the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index column contains the value 0.
(It's possible to create a row where the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column is 0 by
explicitly setting the column to 0 with an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement)

This isn't an error in itself, but could cause trouble if you decide to
dump the table and restore it or do an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the
table. In this case the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column will change value,
according to the rules of <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns, which could cause
problems like a duplicate key error.

To get rid of the warning, just execute an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement
to set the column to some other value than 0.

as running <CODE>myisamchk -r table_name</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
Normally you should never have to run this command, but if disaster strikes
you are very likely to get back all your data from a MyISAM table with
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>. If your tables get corrupted a lot you should
try to find the reason for this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_problems">7.1.3  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Problems</A>.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Note that you can get many rows of information for each repaired
table. The last one row will be of <CODE>Msg_type status</CODE> and should
normally be <CODE>OK</CODE>.  If you don't get <CODE>OK</CODE>, you should try
repairing the table with <CODE>myisamchk -o</CODE>, as <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>
does not yet implement all the options of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. In the near
future, we will make it more flexible.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>QUICK</CODE> is given then MySQL will try to do a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> of only the index tree.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>EXTENDED</CODE> then MySQL will create the index row
by row instead of creating one index at a time with sorting; this may be
better than sorting on fixed-length keys if you have long <CODE>CHAR</CODE>
keys that compress very well.  This type of repair is like that done by
<CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.2, there is a <CODE>USE_FRM</CODE> mode for <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>.
Use it if the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file is missing or if its header is corrupted.
In this mode MySQL will recreate the table, using information from the
<TT>`.frm'</TT> file. This kind of repair cannot be done with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Table_maintenance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
To check/repair MyISAM tables (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>) you should
use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility. To check/repair ISAM tables
(<TT>`.ISM'</TT> and <TT>`.ISD'</TT>) you should use the <CODE>isamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the following text we will talk about <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but everything
also applies to the old <CODE>isamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility to get information about your
database tables, check and repair them, or optimise them.  The following
sections describe how to invoke <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (including a
description of its options), how to set up a table maintenance schedule,
and how to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to perform its various functions.

</P>
<P>
You can, in most cases, also use the command <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLES</CODE> to
optimise and repair tables, but this is not as fast or reliable (in case
of real fatal errors) as <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  On the other hand,
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier to use and you don't have to worry about
flushing tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Even that the repair in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is quite secure, it's always a
good idea to make a backup <EM>before</EM> doing a repair (or anything that could
make a lot of changes to a table)

</P>



<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_syntax" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A></H4>

<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk [options] tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>options</CODE> specify what you want <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to do.  They are
described here.  (You can also get a list of options by invoking
<CODE>myisamchk --help</CODE>.)  With no options, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> simply checks your
table.  To get more information or to tell <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to take corrective
action, specify options as described here and in the following sections.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the database table you want to check/repair.  If you run
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> somewhere other than in the database directory, you must
specify the path to the file, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> has no idea where your
database is located.  Actually, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> doesn't care whether
the files you are working on are located in a database directory; you can
copy the files that correspond to a database table into another location and
perform recovery operations on them there.

</P>
<P>
You can name several tables on the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command-line if you
wish.  You can also specify a name as an index file
name (with the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> suffix), which allows you to specify all
tables in a directory by using the pattern <TT>`*.MYI'</TT>.
For example, if you are in a database directory, you can check all the
tables in the directory like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk *.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the tables there
by specifying the path to the directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a wildcard
with the path to the MySQL data directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
The recommended way to quickly check all tables is:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to check all tables and repair all tables that are corrupted,
you can use the following line:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state -O key_buffer=64M \
          -O sort_buffer=64M -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M \
          /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
isamchk --silent --force -O key_buffer=64M -O sort_buffer=64M \
        -O read_buffer=1M -O write_buffer=1M /path/to/datadir/*/*.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
The above assumes that you have more than 64 M free.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you get an error like:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk: warning: 1 clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
</PRE>

<P>
This means that you are trying to check a table that has been updated by
the another program (like the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server) that hasn't yet closed
the file or that has died without closing the file properly.

</P>
<P>
If you <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running, you must force a sync/close of all
tables with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and ensure that no one is using the
tables while you are running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In MySQL Version 3.23
the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
instead of <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check tables.

<TR><TD>decode_bits </TD><TD> 9
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> is used when the keys are repaired by sorting
keys, which is the normal case when you use <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is used when you are checking the table with
<CODE>--extended-check</CODE> or when the keys are repaired by inserting key
row by row in to the table (like when doing normal inserts). Repairing
through the key buffer is used in the following cases:


<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

If the temporary files needed to sort the keys would be more than twice
as big as when creating the key file directly.  This is often the case
when you have big <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> keys as the
sort needs to store the whole keys during sorting. If you have lots
of temporary space and you can force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair by sorting
you can use the <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE> option.
</UL>

Reparing through the key buffer takes much less disk space than using
sorting, but is also much slower.

If you want a faster repair, set the above variables to about 1/4 of your
available memory.  You can set both variables to big values, as only one
of the above buffers will be used at a time.

<DT><CODE>-s or --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur. You can use <CODE>-s</CODE>
twice (<CODE>-ss</CODE>) to make <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> very silent.
<DT><CODE>-v or --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print more information. This can be used with <CODE>-d</CODE> and
<CODE>-e</CODE>. Use <CODE>-v</CODE> multiple times (<CODE>-vv</CODE>, <CODE>-vvv</CODE>) for more
verbosity!
<DT><CODE>-V or --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> version and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w or, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of giving an error if the table is locked, wait until the table
is unlocked before continuing.  Note that if you are running <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
on the table with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>, the table can only be locked
by another <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command.

<DD>
Check table for errors. This is the default operation if you are not

<DT><CODE>-e or --extend-check</CODE>
<DD>
Check the table very thoroughly (which is quite slow if you have many
indexes).  This option should only be used in extreme cases.  Normally,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk --medium-check</CODE> should, in most
cases, be able to find out if there are any errors in the table.

If you are using <CODE>--extended-check</CODE> and have much memory, you should
increase the value of <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> a lot!

<DT><CODE>-F or --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that haven't been closed properly.
<DT><CODE>-C or --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since the last check.
<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> finds any errors in the table.
<DT><CODE>-i or --information</CODE>
<DD>
Print informational statistics about the table that is checked.
<DT><CODE>-m or --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99% of all errors.
Should, however, be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-U or --update-state</CODE>
<DD>
Store in the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file when the table was checked and if the table crashed.  This should be used to get full benefit of the
<CODE>--check-only-changed</CODE> option, but you shouldn't use this
option if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is using the table and you are
running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-T or --read-only</CODE>

Try to recover every possible row from the datafile.
Normally this will also find a lot of garbage rows. Don't use this option

<DT><CODE>-f or --force</CODE>
<DD>
Overwrite old temporary files (<CODE>table_name.TMD</CODE>) instead of aborting.
<DT><CODE>-k # or keys-used=#</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using ISAM, tells the ISAM storage engine to update only the
first <CODE>#</CODE> indexes.  If you are using <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, tells which keys
to use, where each binary bit stands for one key (first key is bit 0).
This can be used to get faster inserts!  Deactivated indexes can be
reactivated by using <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.  keys.
<DT><CODE>-l or --no-symlinks</CODE>

Do not follow symbolic links. Normally <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> repairs the
table a symlink points at.  This option doesn't exist in MySQL 4.0,
as MySQL 4.0 will not remove symlinks during repair.
<DT><CODE>-r or --recover</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique
(which is an extremely unlikely error with ISAM/MyISAM tables).
If you want to recover a table, this is the option to try first. Only if
myisamchk reports that the table can't be recovered by <CODE>-r</CODE>, you
should then try <CODE>-o</CODE>.  (Note that in the unlikely case that <CODE>-r</CODE>
fails, the datafile is still intact.)
If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-o or --safe-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Uses an old recovery method (reads through all rows in order and updates
all index trees based on the found rows); this is an order of magnitude
slower than <CODE>-r</CODE>, but can handle a couple of very unlikely cases that
<CODE>-r</CODE> cannot handle.  This recovery method also uses much less disk
space than <CODE>-r</CODE>. Normally one should always first repair with
<CODE>-r</CODE>, and only if this fails use <CODE>-o</CODE>.

If you have lots of memory, you should increase the size of
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>!
<DT><CODE>-n or --sort-recover</CODE>
<DD>
Force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to use sorting to resolve the keys even if the
temporary files should be very big.

<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are stored.
<DT><CODE>--set-character-set=name</CODE>
<DD>
Change the character set used by the index
<DT><CODE>-t or --tmpdir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path for storing temporary files. If this is not set, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will
use the environment variable <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> for this.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> can be set to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<DT><CODE>-q or --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Faster repair by not modifying the datafile. One can give a second
<CODE>-q</CODE> to force <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to modify the original datafile in case
of duplicate keys
<DT><CODE>-u or --unpack</CODE>
<DD>
Unpack file packed with myisampack.

<P>
Other actions that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can do, besides repair and check tables:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a or --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyse the distribution of keys. This improves join performance by
enabling the join optimiser to better choose in which order it should
join the tables and which keys it should use:
<CODE>myisamchk --describe --verbose table_name'</CODE> or using <CODE>SHOW KEYS</CODE> in
MySQL.
<DT><CODE>-d or --description</CODE>
<DD>
Prints some information about table.
<DT><CODE>-A or --set-auto-increment[=value]</CODE>
<DD>
Force <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> to start at this or higher value. If no value is
given, then sets the next <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value to the highest used value
for the auto key + 1.
<DT><CODE>-S or --sort-index</CODE>
<DD>
Sort the index tree blocks in high-low order.
This will optimise seeks and will make table scanning by key faster.
<DT><CODE>-R or --sort-records=#</CODE>
<DD>
Sorts records according to an index.  This makes your data much more localised
and may speed up ranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> operations on
this index. (It may be very slow to do a sort the first time!)
To find out a table's index numbers, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE>, which shows a
table's indexes in the same order that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> sees them.  Indexes are
numbered beginning with 1.

<H4><A NAME="myisamchk_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#myisamchk_memory">4.4.6.6  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Memory Usage</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>

</P>
<P>
Memory allocation is important when you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses no more memory than you specify with the <CODE>-O</CODE>
options.  If you are going to use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on very large files,
you should first decide how much memory you want it to use.  The default
is to use only about 3M to fix things.  By using larger values, you can
get <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to operate faster.  For example, if you have more
than 32M RAM, you could use options such as these (in addition to any
other options you might specify):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk -O sort=16M -O key=16M -O read=1M -O write=1M ...
</PRE>

<P>
Using <CODE>-O sort=16M</CODE> should probably be enough for most cases.

</P>
<P>
Be aware that <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> uses temporary files in <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>. If
<CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> points to a memory filesystem, you may easily get out of
memory errors. If this happens, set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point at some directory
with more space and restart <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When repairing, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will also need a lot of disk space:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Double the size of the record file (the original one and a copy).  This
space is not needed if one does a repair with <CODE>--quick</CODE>, as in this
case only the index file will be re-created.  This space is needed on the
same disk as the original record file!
<LI>

Space for the new index file that replaces the old one. The old
index file is truncated at start, so one usually ignore this space.
This space is needed on the same disk as the original index file!
<LI>

When using <CODE>--recover</CODE> or <CODE>--sort-recover</CODE>
(but not when using <CODE>--safe-recover</CODE>), you will need space for a
sort buffer for:
<CODE>(largest_key + row_pointer_length)*number_of_rows * 2</CODE>.
You can check the length of the keys and the row_pointer_length with
<CODE>myisamchk -dv table</CODE>.
This space is allocated on the temporary disk (specified by <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> or
<CODE>--tmpdir=#</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
If you have a problem with disk space during repair, you can try to use
<CODE>--safe-recover</CODE> instead of <CODE>--recover</CODE>.

If you run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> (which is the
default on some systems, like Linux), you can't reliably use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
to check a table when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is using the same table.  If you
can be sure that no one is accessing the tables through <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
while you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, you only have to do <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE> before you start checking the tables.  If you can't
guarantee the above, then you must take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> while you
check the tables.  If you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> while <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is updating
the tables, you may get a warning that a table is corrupt even if it
isn't.

</P>
<P>
If you are not using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>, you can use
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check tables at any time.  While you do this, all clients
that try to update the table will wait until <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is ready before
continuing.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to repair or optimise tables, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> always ensure that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not using
the table (this also applies if you are using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>).
If you don't take down <CODE>mysqld</CODE> you should at least do a
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
Your tables <STRONG>may be corrupted</STRONG> if the server and <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
access the tables simultaneously.

</P>
<P>
This chapter describes how to check for and deal with data corruption
in MySQL databases.  If your tables get corrupted frequently you should
try to find the reason for this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table section contains reason for why a table could be
corrupted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_problems">7.1.3  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Problems</A>.

</P>
<P>
When performing crash recovery, it is important to understand that each table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in a database corresponds to three files in the database
directory:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>File</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.frm'</TT> </TD><TD> Table definition (form) file
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.MYD'</TT> </TD><TD> Datafile
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><TT>`tbl_name.MYI'</TT> </TD><TD> Index file
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Each of these three file types is subject to corruption in various ways, but
problems occur most often in datafiles and index files.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> works by creating a copy of the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> (data) file
row by row. It ends the repair stage by removing the old <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file and renaming the new file to the original file name.  If you use
<CODE>--quick</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not create a temporary <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file, but instead assumes that the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is correct and only
generates a new index file without touching the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file. This
is safe, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> automatically detects if the
<TT>`.MYD'</TT> file is corrupt and aborts the repair in this case.  You can
also give two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options to <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  In this case,
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> does not abort on some errors (like duplicate key) but
instead tries to resolve them by modifying the <TT>`.MYD'</TT>
file. Normally the use of two <CODE>--quick</CODE> options is useful only if
you have too little free disk space to perform a normal repair.  In this
case you should at least make a backup before running <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To check a MyISAM table, use the following commands:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This finds 99.99% of all errors. What it can't find is corruption that
involves <STRONG>only</STRONG> the datafile (which is very unusual). If you want
to check a table, you should normally run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> without options or
with either the <CODE>-s</CODE> or <CODE>--silent</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -m tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This finds 99.999% of all errors. It checks first all index entries for errors and
then it reads through all rows. It calculates a checksum for all keys in
the rows and verifies that they checksum matches the checksum for the keys
in the index tree.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
This does a complete and thorough check of all data (<CODE>-e</CODE> means
``extended check''). It does a check-read of every key for each row to verify
that they indeed point to the correct row.  This may take a long time on a
big table with many keys.  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will normally stop after the first
error it finds. If you want to obtain more information, you can add the
<CODE>--verbose</CODE> (<CODE>-v</CODE>) option.  This causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to keep
going, up through a maximum of 20 errors.  In normal usage, a simple
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (with no arguments other than the table name) is sufficient.

<DT><CODE>myisamchk -e -i tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Like the previous command, but the <CODE>-i</CODE> option tells <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to
print some informational statistics, too.

</P>
<P>
In the following section we only talk about using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>).  If you
are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables (extensions <TT>`.ISM'</TT> and <TT>`.ISD'</TT>),
you should use <CODE>isamchk</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.14, you can repair MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The symptoms of a corrupted table include queries that abort unexpectedly
and observable errors such as these:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`tbl_name.frm'</TT> is locked against change
<LI>

Can't find file <TT>`tbl_name.MYI'</TT> (Errcode: ###)
<LI>

Unexpected end of file
<LI>

Record file is crashed
<LI>

Got error ### from table handler

To get more information about the error you can run <CODE>perror ###</CODE>. Here
is the most common errors that indicates a problem with the table:


<PRE>
shell&#62; perror 126 127 132 134 135 136 141 144 145
126 = Index file is crashed / Wrong file format
127 = Record-file is crashed
132 = Old database file
134 = Record was already deleted (or record file crashed)
135 = No more room in record file
136 = No more room in index file
141 = Duplicate unique key or constraint on write or update
144 = Table is crashed and last repair failed
145 = Table was marked as crashed and should be repaired
</PRE>

Note that error 135, no more room in record file, is not an error that
can be fixed by a simple repair. In this case you have to do:


<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table MAX_ROWS=xxx AVG_ROW_LENGTH=yyy;
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
In the other cases, you must repair your tables. <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
can usually detect and fix most things that go wrong.

</P>
<P>
The repair process involves up to four stages, described here. Before you
begin, you should <CODE>cd</CODE> to the database directory and check the
permissions of the table files. Make sure they are readable by the Unix user
that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> runs as (and to you, because you need to access the files
you are checking).  If it turns out you need to modify files, they must also
be writable by you.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL Version 3.23.16 and above, you can (and
should) use the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> commands to check and repair
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The manual section about table maintenance includes the options to
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_maintenance">4.4.6  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following section is for the cases where the above command fails or
if you want to use the extended features that <CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> provides.

</P>
<P>
If you are going to repair a table from the command-line, you must first
take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. Note that when you do
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE> on a remote server, the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
will still be alive for a while after <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> returns, until
all queries are stopped and all keys have been flushed to disk.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 1: Checking your tables</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Run <CODE>myisamchk *.MYI</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk -e *.MYI</CODE> if you have
more time.  Use the <CODE>-s</CODE> (silent) option to suppress unnecessary
information.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is done you should use the --update option to tell
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to mark the table as 'checked'.

</P>
<P>
You have to repair only those tables for which <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> announces an
error.  For such tables, proceed to Stage 2.

</P>
<P>
If you get weird errors when checking (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 2: Easy safe repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Note: If you want repairing to go much faster, you should add: <CODE>-O
sort_buffer=# -O key_buffer=#</CODE> (where # is about 1/4 of the available
memory) to all <CODE>isamchk/myisamchk</CODE> commands.

</P>
<P>
First, try <CODE>myisamchk -r -q tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r -q</CODE> means ``quick
recovery mode''). This will attempt to repair the index file without
touching the datafile.  If the datafile contains everything that it
should and the delete links point at the correct locations within the
datafile, this should work, and the table is fixed. Start repairing the
next table.  Otherwise, use the following procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make a backup of the datafile before continuing.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk -r tbl_name</CODE> (<CODE>-r</CODE> means ``recovery mode''). This will
remove incorrect records and deleted records from the datafile and
reconstruct the index file.

<LI>

If the preceding step fails, use <CODE>myisamchk --safe-recover tbl_name</CODE>.
Safe recovery mode uses an old recovery method that handles a few cases that
regular recovery mode doesn't (but is slower).
</OL>

<P>
If you get weird errors when repairing (such as <CODE>out of
memory</CODE> errors), or if <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> crashes, go to Stage 3.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 3: Difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should only reach this stage if the first 16K block in the index file is
destroyed or contains incorrect information, or if the index file is
missing.  In this case, it's necessary to create a new index file. Do so as
follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Move the datafile to some safe place.

<LI>

Use the table description file to create new (empty) data and index files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql db_name
mysql&#62; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
mysql&#62; quit
</PRE>

If your SQL version doesn't have <CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE>, use <CODE>DELETE FROM
table_name</CODE> instead.

<LI>

Copy the old datafile back onto the newly created datafile.
(Don't just move the old file back onto the new file; you want to retain
a copy in case something goes wrong.)
</OL>

<P>
Go back to Stage 2.  <CODE>myisamchk -r -q</CODE> should work now.  (This shouldn't
be an endless loop.)

</P>
<P>
As of <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0.2 you can also use <CODE>REPAIR ... USE_FRM</CODE>
which performs the whole procedure automatically.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Stage 4: Very difficult repair</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
You should reach this stage only if the description file has also
crashed. That should never happen, because the description file isn't changed
after the table is created:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Restore the description file from a backup and go back to Stage 3.  You can
also restore the index file and go back to Stage 2.  In the latter case, you
should start with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.

<LI>

If you don't have a backup but know exactly how the table was created, create
a copy of the table in another database.  Remove the new datafile, then move
the description and index files from the other database to your crashed
database.  This gives you new description and index files, but leaves
the datafile alone.  Go back to Stage 2 and attempt to reconstruct
the index file.
</OL>

You can optimise a table in the same way using the SQL <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>

There is also no possibility of unwanted interaction between a utility

Starting with MySQL Version 3.23.13, you can check MyISAM
tables with the <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  You can
repair tables with the <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to perform table checks on a regular basis rather than
waiting for problems to occur.  For maintenance purposes, you can use
<CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> to check tables.  The <CODE>-s</CODE> option (short for
<CODE>--silent</CODE>) causes <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to run in silent mode, printing
messages only when errors occur.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
It's also a good idea to check tables when the server starts up.
For example, whenever the machine has done a reboot in the middle of an
update, you usually need to check all the tables that could have been
affected. (This is an ``expected crashed table''.) You could add a test to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> that runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to check all tables that have
been modified during the last 24 hours if there is an old <TT>`.pid'</TT>
(process ID) file left after a reboot.  (The <TT>`.pid'</TT> file is created by
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> when it starts up and removed when it terminates normally.  The
presence of a <TT>`.pid'</TT> file at system startup time indicates that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> terminated abnormally.)

</P>
<P>
An even better test would be to check any table whose last-modified time
is more recent than that of the <TT>`.pid'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also check your tables regularly during normal system
operation.  At MySQL AB, we run a <CODE>cron</CODE> job to check all
our important tables once a week, using a line like this in a <TT>`crontab'</TT>
file:

</P>

<PRE>
35 0 * * 0 /path/to/myisamchk --fast --silent /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
</PRE>

<P>
This prints out information about crashed tables so we can examine and repair
them when needed.

</P>
<P>
As we haven't had any unexpectedly crashed tables (tables that become
corrupted for reasons other than hardware trouble)
for a couple of years now (this is really true), once a week is
more than enough for us.

</P>
<P>
We recommend that to start with, you execute <CODE>myisamchk -s</CODE> each
night on all tables that have been updated during the last 24 hours,
until you come to trust MySQL as much as we do.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
Normally you don't need to maintain MySQL tables that much.  If
you are changing tables with dynamic size rows (tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns) or have tables with many deleted rows
you may want to from time to time (once a month?) defragment/reclaim space
from the tables.

</P>
<P>
You can do this by using <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on the tables in question or
if you can take the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server down for a while do:

</P>

<PRE>
isamchk -r --silent --sort-index -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.ISM
myisamchk -r --silent --sort-index  -O sort_buffer_size=16M */*.MYI

<P>
To get a description of a table or statistics about it, use the commands shown
here. We explain some of the information in more detail later:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>myisamchk -d tbl_name

Runs <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> in ``describe mode'' to produce a description of
your table. If you start the MySQL server using the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option, <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> may report an error
for a table that is updated while it runs.  However, because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
doesn't change the table in describe mode, there isn't any risk of
destroying data.

<LI>myisamchk -d -v tbl_name

To produce more information about what <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is doing, add <CODE>-v</CODE>
to tell it to run in verbose mode.

<LI>myisamchk -eis tbl_name

Shows only the most important information from a table. It is slow because it
must read the whole table.

<LI>myisamchk -eiv tbl_name

This is like <CODE>-eis</CODE>, but tells you what is being done.

Here are the sizes of the data and index files for the table used in the
preceding examples:

</PRE>

<P>
Explanations for the types of information <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> produces are
given here.  The ``keyfile'' is the index file.  ``Record'' and ``row''
are synonymous:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>ISAM file

Name of the ISAM (index) file.

<LI>Isam-version

Version of ISAM format. Currently always 2.

<LI>Creation time

When the datafile was created.

<LI>Recover time

When the index/datafile was last reconstructed.

<LI>Data records

How many records are in the table.

<LI>Deleted blocks

How many deleted blocks still have reserved space.
You can optimise your table to minimise this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Data file: Parts

For dynamic record format, this indicates how many data blocks there are. For
an optimised table without fragmented records, this is the same as <CODE>Data
records</CODE>.

<LI>Deleted data

How many bytes of non-reclaimed deleted data there are.
You can optimise your table to minimise this space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Data file pointer

The size of the datafile pointer, in bytes. It is usually 2, 3, 4, or 5
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this cannot be controlled
from MySQL yet. For fixed tables, this is a record address. For
dynamic tables, this is a byte address.

<LI>Keyfile pointer

The size of the index file pointer, in bytes. It is usually 1, 2, or 3
bytes. Most tables manage with 2 bytes, but this is calculated
automatically by MySQL. It is always a block address.

<LI>Max datafile length

How long the table's datafile (<TT>`.MYD'</TT> file) can become, in bytes.

<LI>Max keyfile length

How long the table's key file (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> file) can become, in bytes.

<LI>Recordlength

How much space each record takes, in bytes.

<LI>Record format

The format used to store table rows.
The examples shown above use <CODE>Fixed length</CODE>.
Other possible values are <CODE>Compressed</CODE> and <CODE>Packed</CODE>.

<LI>table description

A list of all keys in the table. For each key, some low-level information
is presented:


<UL>
<LI>Key

This key's number.

<LI>Start

Where in the record this index part starts.

<LI>Len

How long this index part is. For packed numbers, this should always be
the full length of the column. For strings, it may be shorter than the full
length of the indexed column, because you can index a prefix of a string
column.

<LI>Index

<CODE>unique</CODE> or <CODE>multip.</CODE> (multiple). Indicates whether one value
can exist multiple times in this index.

<LI>Type

What data-type this index part has. This is an ISAM data-type
with the options <CODE>packed</CODE>, <CODE>stripped</CODE> or <CODE>empty</CODE>.

<LI>Root

Address of the root index block.

<LI>Blocksize

The size of each index block. By default this is 1024, but the value may be
changed at compile time.

<LI>Rec/key

This is a statistical value used by the optimiser. It tells how many
records there are per value for this key. A unique key always has a
value of 1. This may be updated after a table is loaded (or greatly
changed) with <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE>. If this is not updated at all, a default
value of 30 is given.
</UL>

<LI>

In the first example above, the 9th key is a multi-part key with two parts.

<LI>Keyblocks used

What percentage of the keyblocks are used. Because the table used in the
examples had just been reorganised with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, the values are very
high (very near the theoretical maximum).

<LI>Packed

MySQL tries to pack keys with a common suffix. This can only be used
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE>/<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>/<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> keys. For long strings like
names, this can significantly reduce the space used. In the third example
above, the 4th key is 10 characters long and a 60% reduction in space is
achieved.

<LI>Max levels

How deep the B-tree for this key is. Large tables with long keys get high
values.

<LI>Records

How many rows are in the table.

<LI>M.recordlength

The average record length. For tables with fixed-length records, this is the
exact record length.

<LI>Packed

MySQL strips spaces from the end of strings. The <CODE>Packed</CODE>
value indicates the percentage of savings achieved by doing this.

<LI>Recordspace used

What percentage of the datafile is used.

<LI>Empty space

What percentage of the datafile is unused.

<LI>Blocks/Record

Average number of blocks per record (that is, how many links a fragmented
record is composed of). This is always 1.0 for fixed-format tables. This
value should stay as close to 1.0 as possible. If it gets too big, you can
reorganise the table with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

<LI>Recordblocks

How many blocks (links) are used. For fixed format, this is the same as the number
of records.

<LI>Deleteblocks

How many blocks (links) are deleted.

<LI>Recorddata

How many bytes in the datafile are used.

<LI>Deleted data

How many bytes in the datafile are deleted (unused).

<LI>Lost space

If a record is updated to a shorter length, some space is lost. This is
the sum of all such losses, in bytes.

<LI>Linkdata

When the dynamic table format is used, record fragments are linked with
pointers (4 to 7 bytes each). <CODE>Linkdata</CODE> is the sum of the amount of
storage used by all such pointers.
</UL>

<P>
If a table has been compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, <CODE>myisamchk
-d</CODE> prints additional information about each table column.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>, for an example of this
information and a description of what it means.

<PRE>
OPTIMIZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name]...
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> should be used if you have deleted a large part of a
table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows
(tables that have <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns).
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations reuse old record positions. You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the datafile.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> works only on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables. For <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
currently mapped to <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> to work on other table types by starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> or <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE>, but in this
case <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is just mapped to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

<UL>
<LI>

If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
<LI>

If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
<LI>

If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be done
by sorting the index), update them.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> for a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table is equivalent to running
<CODE>myisamchk --quick --check-only-changed --sort-index --analyze</CODE>
on the table.

</P>
<P>
Note that the table is locked during the time <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is
running!

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX586"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
ANALYZE TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name...]
</PRE>

<P>
Analyse and store the key distribution for the table.  During the
analysis, the table is locked with a read lock.  This works on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to running <CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses the stored key distribution to decide in which order
tables should be joined when one does a join on something else than a
constant.

</P>
<P>
The command returns a table with the following columns:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Msg_text </TD><TD> The message.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You can check the stored key distribution with the <CODE>SHOW INDEX</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_DATABASE_INFO">4.5.6.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the table hasn't changed since the last <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> command,
the table will not be analysed again.

FLUSH flush_option [,flush_option] ...
</PRE>

<P>
You should use the <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> command if you want to clear some of the
internal caches MySQL uses.  To execute <CODE>FLUSH</CODE>, you must have
the <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> privilege.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>flush_option</CODE> can be any of the following:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

<TR><TD><CODE>HOSTS</CODE> </TD><TD> Empties the host cache tables.  You should flush the
host tables if some of your hosts change IP number or if you get the
error message <CODE>Host ... is blocked</CODE>.  When more than
<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> errors occur in a row for a given host while
connection to the MySQL server, MySQL assumes
something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection requests.
Flushing the host tables allows the host to attempt to connect
again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Blocked_host">A.2.4  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A>. You can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O max_connect_errors=999999999</CODE> to avoid this error message.

If you have specified the update log file or a binary log file without
an extension, the extension number of the log file will be incremented
by one relative to the previous file.  If you have used an extension in
the file name, MySQL will close and reopen the update log file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>. This is the same thing as sending the <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>

which threads are running with the <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> command and kill
a thread with the <CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
If you have the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege, you can see all threads.
If you have the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege, you can kill all threads.
Otherwise, you can only see and kill your own threads.

</P>
<P>
You can also use the <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> and <CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE>
commands to examine and kill threads.

</P>
<P>
When you do a <CODE>KILL</CODE>, a thread-specific <CODE>kill flag</CODE> is set for
the thread.

</P>
<P>
In most cases it may take some time for the thread to die as the kill
flag is only checked at specific intervals.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> loops, the flag is
checked after reading a block of rows. If the kill flag is set, the
statement is aborted.
<LI>

When doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> the kill flag is checked before each block of
rows are read from the original table. If the kill flag was set the command
is aborted and the temporary table is deleted.
<LI>

When doing an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, the kill flag
is checked after each block read and after each updated or deleted
row. If the kill flag is set, the statement is aborted.  Note that if you
are not using transactions, the changes will not be rolled back!
<LI>

<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> will abort with <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

An <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> thread will quickly flush all rows it has in
memory and die.
<LI>

If the thread is in the table lock handler (state: <CODE>Locked</CODE>),
the table lock will be quickly aborted.
<LI>

If the thread is waiting for free disk space in a <CODE>write</CODE> call, the
write is aborted with an disk full error message.

mysql&#62; SHOW INDEX FROM mytable FROM mydb;
mysql&#62; SHOW INDEX FROM mydb.mytable;

<P>
<CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> lists the databases on the MySQL server host.
You can also get this list using the <CODE>mysqlshow</CODE> command line tool.
In version 4.0.2 you will only see those databases for which you have some
kind of privilege, if you don't have the global <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE>
privilege.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> lists the tables in a given database.  You can also
get this list using the <CODE>mysqlshow db_name</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: if a user doesn't have any privileges for a table, the table
will not show up in the output from <CODE>SHOW TABLES</CODE> or <CODE>mysqlshow
db_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW OPEN TABLES</CODE> lists the tables that are currently open in
the table cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.7  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.  The <CODE>Comment</CODE> field tells
how many times the table is <CODE>cached</CODE> and <CODE>in_use</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS</CODE> lists the columns in a given table.  If you specify
the <CODE>FULL</CODE> option, you will also get the privileges you have for
each column.  If the column types are different from what you expect them to
be based on a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement, note that MySQL
sometimes changes column types.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

<P>
<CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS</CODE>, and

either split your table(s) or use replication. Available after 3.23.33.

<P>
Some comments about the above:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
variable is probably too small.
<LI>

If <CODE>Key_reads</CODE> is big, then your <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> variable is
probably too small.  The <STRONG>cache miss rate</STRONG> can be calculated with
<CODE>Key_reads</CODE>/<CODE>Key_read_requests</CODE>.
<LI>

If <CODE>Handler_read_rnd</CODE> is big, then you probably have a lot of
queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables or you have
joins that don't use keys properly.
<LI>

If <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> is big, you may want to increase the
<CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable.  The cache hit rate can be calculated
with <CODE>Threads_created</CODE>/<CODE>Connections</CODE>.
<LI>

If <CODE>Created_tmp_disk_tables</CODE> is big, you may want to increase the
<CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> variable to get the temporary tables memory-based
instead of disk based.
</UL>

<PRE>
SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION] VARIABLES [LIKE wild]
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> shows the values of some MySQL system
variables.  You can also get this information using the <CODE>mysqladmin
variables</CODE> command.  If the default values are unsuitable, you can set most
of these variables using command-line options when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
The options <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> and <CODE>SESSION</CODE> are new in MySQL 4.0.3.
With <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> you will get the variables that will be used for new
connections to MySQL. With <CODE>SESSION</CODE> you will get the values that
are in effect for the current connection. If you are not using either
option, <CODE>SESSION</CODE> is used.

</P>
<P>
You can change most options with the  <CODE>SET</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

The output resembles that shown here, though the format and numbers may
differ somewhat:

<P>
Each option is described here. Values for buffer sizes, lengths, and stack
sizes are given in bytes.  You can specify values with a suffix of <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`M'</SAMP> to indicate kilobytes or megabytes. For example, <CODE>16M</CODE>
indicates 16 megabytes.  The case of suffix letters does not matter;
<CODE>16M</CODE> and <CODE>16m</CODE> are equivalent:

<P>
<A NAME="IDX617"></A>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>ansi_mode</CODE>.

Is <CODE>ON</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was started with <CODE>--ansi</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_mode">1.7.2  Running MySQL in ANSI Mode</A>.

<LI><CODE>back_log</CODE>

The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can have. This
comes into play when the main MySQL thread gets <STRONG>very</STRONG>
many connection requests in a very short time. It then takes some time
(although very little) for the main thread to check the connection and start
a new thread. The <CODE>back_log</CODE> value indicates how many requests can be
stacked during this short time before MySQL momentarily stops
answering new requests. You need to increase this only if you expect a large
number of connections in a short period of time.

In other words, this value is the size of the listen queue for incoming
TCP/IP connections.  Your operating system has its own limit on the size
of this queue.  The manual page for the Unix <CODE>listen(2)</CODE> system
call should have more details.  Check your OS documentation for the
maximum value for this variable.  Attempting to set <CODE>back_log</CODE>
higher than your operating system limit will be ineffective.

<LI><CODE>basedir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_cache_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<LI><CODE>bdb_log_buffer_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated to cache index and rows for <CODE>BDB</CODE>
tables.  If you don't use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should set this to 0 or
start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> to not waste memory for this
cache.

<LI><CODE>bdb_home</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-home</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE>

The maximum number of locks (10,000 by default) you can have active on a
BDB table. You should increase this if you get errors of type <CODE>bdb:
Lock table is out of available locks</CODE> or <CODE>Got error 12 from ...</CODE>
when you have do long transactions or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has to examine
a lot of rows to calculate the query.

<LI><CODE>bdb_logdir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-logdir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>bdb_shared_data</CODE>

Is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you are using <CODE>--bdb-shared-data</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>bdb_tmpdir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--bdb-tmpdir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE>.  The size of the cache to hold the SQL

statements for the binary log during a transaction.  If you often use
big, multi-statement transactions you can increase this to get more
performance. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI><CODE>bulk_insert_buffer_size</CODE> (was <CODE>myisam_bulk_insert_tree_size</CODE>)

MyISAM uses special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts (that is,
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ...</CODE>, and
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>) faster. This variable limits
the size of the cache tree in bytes per thread. Setting it to 0
will disable this optimisation.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: this cache is only used when adding data to non-empty table.
Default value is 8 MB.

<LI><CODE>character_set</CODE>

The default character set.

<LI><CODE>character_sets</CODE>

The supported character sets.

<LI><CODE>concurrent_inserts</CODE>

If <CODE>ON</CODE> (the default), MySQL will allow you to use <CODE>INSERT</CODE> on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time as you run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries
on them.  You can turn this option off by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--safe</CODE> or <CODE>--skip-new</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX618"></A>
<LI><CODE>connect_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is waiting for a connect
packet before responding with <CODE>Bad handshake</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>datadir</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--datadir</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>delay_key_write</CODE>

Option for MyISAM tables. Can have one of the following values:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD>OFF </TD><TD> All CREATE TABLE ... DELAYED_KEY_WRITES are ignored.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ON </TD><TD> (default)  MySQL will honor the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option
for <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ALL </TD><TD> All new opened tables are treated as if they were created with the <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> option.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

If <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> is enabled this means that the key buffer for
tables with this option will not get flushed on every index update, but
only when a table is closed.  This will speed up writes on keys a lot,
but you should add automatic checking of all tables with <CODE>myisamchk
--fast --force</CODE> if you use this.

<LI><CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE>

After inserting <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows, the <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler will check if there are any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements
pending. If so, it allows these to execute before continuing.

<LI><CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE>

How long a <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> thread should wait for <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements before terminating.

<LI><CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE>

What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for handling <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE>.  If the queue becomes full, any client that does <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> will wait until there is room in the queue again.

<LI><CODE>flush</CODE>

This is <CODE>ON</CODE> if you have started MySQL with the <CODE>--flush</CODE>
option.

<LI><CODE>flush_time</CODE>

If this is set to a non-zero value, then every <CODE>flush_time</CODE> seconds all
tables will be closed (to free up resources and sync things to disk). We
only recommend this option on Windows 9x/Me, or on systems where you have
very little resources.

<LI><CODE>ft_boolean_syntax</CODE>

List of operators supported by <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST(... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.

<LI><CODE>ft_min_word_len</CODE>

The minimum length of the word to be included in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.)

<LI><CODE>ft_max_word_len</CODE>

The maximum length of the word to be included in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.)

<LI><CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE>

The maximum length of the word in a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index
to be used in fast index recreation method in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>,
<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>,  or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.  Longer words are inserted the
slow way.  The rule of the thumb is as follows: with
<CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE> increasing, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will create bigger
temporary files (thus slowing the process down, due to disk I/O), and will put
fewer keys in one sort block (again, decreasing the efficiency).  When
<CODE>ft_max_word_len_for_sort</CODE> is too small, instead, <STRONG>MySQL</STRONG> will insert a
lot of words into index the slow way, but short words will be inserted very
quickly.

<LI><CODE>ft_stopword_file</CODE>

The file to read the list of stopwords for fulltext search from.
All the words from the file will be used, comments are <STRONG>not</STRONG> honored.
By default, built-in list of stopwords is used
(as defined in <TT>`myisam/ft_static.c'</TT>).
Setting this parameter to an empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) will disable
stopword filtering.
<STRONG>Note: <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes must be rebuilt after changing
this variable.</STRONG> (This option is new for MySQL 4.0.10)

<LI><CODE>have_innodb</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports InnoDB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-innodb</CODE> is used.
<LI><CODE>have_bdb</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports Berkeley DB tables. <CODE>DISABLED</CODE>
if <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE> is used.
<LI><CODE>have_raid</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports the <CODE>RAID</CODE> option.
<LI><CODE>have_openssl</CODE>

<CODE>YES</CODE> if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> supports SSL (encryption) on the client/server
protocol.

<LI><CODE>init_file</CODE>

The name of the file specified with the <CODE>--init-file</CODE> option when
you start the server.  This is a file of SQL statements you want the
server to execute when it starts.

<LI><CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an interactive
connection before closing it.  An interactive client is defined as a
client that uses the <CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.  See also <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>join_buffer_size</CODE>

The size of the buffer that is used for full joins (joins that do not
use indexes).  The buffer is allocated one time for each full join
between two tables. Increase this value to get a faster full join when
adding indexes is not possible. (Normally the best way to get fast joins
is to add indexes.)

<A NAME="IDX619"></A>
<LI><CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>

Index blocks are buffered and are shared by all threads.
<CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> is the size of the buffer used for index blocks.

Increase this to get better index handling (for all reads and multiple
writes) to as much as you can afford; 64M on a 256M machine that mainly
runs MySQL is quite common.  If you, however, make this too big
(for instance more than 50% of your total memory) your system may start
to page and become extremely slow. Remember that because MySQL does not
cache data reads, you will have to leave some room for the OS
filesystem cache.

You can check the performance of the key buffer by doing <CODE>SHOW
STATUS</CODE> and examine the variables <CODE>Key_read_requests</CODE>,
<CODE>Key_reads</CODE>, <CODE>Key_write_requests</CODE>, and <CODE>Key_writes</CODE>.  The
<CODE>Key_reads/Key_read_request</CODE> ratio should normally be &#60; 0.01.
The <CODE>Key_write/Key_write_requests</CODE> is usually near 1 if you are
using mostly updates/deletes but may be much smaller if you tend to
do updates that affect many at the same time or if you are
using <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW">4.5.6  <CODE>SHOW</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To get even more speed when writing many rows at the same time, use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOCK_TABLES">6.7.2  <CODE>LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI><CODE>language</CODE>

The language used for error messages.

<LI><CODE>large_file_support</CODE>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was compiled with options for big file support.

<LI><CODE>locked_in_memory</CODE>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was locked in memory with <CODE>--memlock</CODE>

<LI><CODE>log</CODE>

If logging of all queries is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_update</CODE>

If the update log is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_bin</CODE>

If the binary log is enabled.

<LI><CODE>log_slave_updates</CODE>

If the updates from the slave should be logged.

<LI><CODE>long_query_time</CODE>

If a query takes longer than this (in seconds), the <CODE>Slow_queries</CODE> counter
will be incremented. If you are using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, the query
will be logged to the slow query logfile. This value is measured in real
time, not CPU time, so a query that may be under the threshold on a lightly
loaded system may be above the threshold on a heavily loaded one.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

<LI><CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE>

If set to 1 table names are stored in lowercase on disk and table
name comparisons will be case-insensitive.
From version 4.0.2, this option also applies to database names.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Name_case_sensitivity">6.1.3  Case Sensitivity in Names</A>.

<LI><CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>

The maximum size of one packet. The message buffer is initialised to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes, but can grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>
bytes when needed.  This value by default is small, to catch big (possibly
wrong) packets.  You must increase this value if you are using big
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. It should be as big as the biggest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> you want
to use.  The protocol limits for <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is 16M in MySQL
3.23 and 1G in MySQL 4.0.

<LI><CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE>

If a multi-statement transaction requires more than this amount of memory,
one will get the error "Multi-statement transaction required more than
'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage".

<LI><CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>

Available after 3.23.33. If a write to the binary (replication) log exceeds
the given value, rotate the logs. You cannot set it to less than 1024 bytes,
or more than 1 GB. Default is 1 GB.

<LI><CODE>max_connections</CODE>

The number of simultaneous clients allowed. Increasing this value increases
the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.  See below for
comments on file descriptor limits. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Too_many_connections">A.2.5  <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> Error</A>.

<LI><CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE>

If there is more than this number of interrupted connections from a host
this host will be blocked from further connections.  You can unblock a host
with the command <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>max_delayed_threads</CODE>

Don't start more than this number of threads to handle <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
statements.  If you try to insert data into a new table after all <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> threads are in use, the row will be inserted as if the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute wasn't specified.

<LI><CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE>

Don't allow creation of heap tables bigger than this.

<LI><CODE>max_join_size</CODE>

Joins that are probably going to read more than <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
records return an error. Set this value if your users tend to perform joins
that lack a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, that take a long time, and that return
millions of rows.

<LI><CODE>max_sort_length</CODE>

The number of bytes to use when sorting <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
values (only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of each value
are used; the rest are ignored).

<LI><CODE>max_user_connections</CODE>

The maximum number of active connections for a single user (0 = no limit).

<LI><CODE>max_tmp_tables</CODE>

(This option doesn't yet do anything.)
Maximum number of temporary tables a client can keep open at the same time.

<LI><CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE>

After this many write locks, allow some read locks to run in between.

<LI><CODE>myisam_recover_options</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>myisam_sort_buffer_size</CODE>

The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when doing a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or when creating indexes with <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> or
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE>.

If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger than
using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the key
cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in large
tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes starting from this version.

<LI><CODE>myisam_max_sort_file_size</CODE>

The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use
while recreating the index (during <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If the file-size would be bigger than this,
the index will be created through the key cache (which is slower).
<STRONG>Note</STRONG> that this parameter is given in megabytes before 4.0.3 and
in bytes starting from this version.

<LI><CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>

The communication buffer is reset to this size between queries. This
should not normally be changed, but if you have very little memory, you
can set it to the expected size of a query.  (That is, the expected length of
SQL statements sent by clients.  If statements exceed this length, the buffer
is automatically enlarged, up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.)

<LI><CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for more data from a connection before aborting
the read.  Note that when we don't expect data from a connection, the timeout
is defined by <CODE>write_timeout</CODE>. See also <CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>net_retry_count</CODE>

If a read on a communication port is interrupted, retry this many times
before giving up.  This value should be quite high on <CODE>FreeBSD</CODE> as
internal interrupts are sent to all threads.

<LI><CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for a block to be written to a connection before
aborting the write.

<LI><CODE>open_files_limit</CODE>

If this is not 0, then <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will use this value to reserve file
descriptors to use with <CODE>setrlimit()</CODE>.  If this value is 0 then
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will reserve <CODE>max_connections*5</CODE> or
<CODE>max_connections + table_cache*2</CODE> (whichever is larger) number of
files.  You should try increasing this if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gives you the
error 'Too many open files'.

<LI><CODE>pid_file</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--pid-file</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>port</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--port</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>protocol_version</CODE>

The protocol version used by the MySQL server.

<LI><CODE>read_buffer_size</CODE> (was <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>)

Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this
size for each table it scans. If you do many sequential scans, you may
want to increase this value.

<LI><CODE>record_rnd_buffer_size</CODE>

When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows are read
through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks.  Can improve <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
by a lot if set to a high value.  As this is a thread-specific variable,
one should not set this big globally, but just change this when running
some specific big queries.

<LI><CODE>query_cache_limit</CODE>

Don't cache results that are bigger than this. (Default 1M).

<LI><CODE>query_cache_size</CODE>

The memory allocated to store results from old queries.
If this is 0, the query cache is disabled (default).

<LI><CODE>query_cache_type</CODE>

This may be set (only numeric) to
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Alias</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Comment</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0 </TD><TD> OFF </TD><TD> Don't cache or retrieve results.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 </TD><TD> ON </TD><TD> Cache all results except <CODE>SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE ...</CODE> queries.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2 </TD><TD> DEMAND </TD><TD> Cache only <CODE>SELECT SQL_CACHE ...</CODE> queries.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI><CODE>safe_show_database</CODE>

Don't show databases for which the user doesn't have any database or
table privileges. This can improve security if you're concerned about
people being able to see what databases other users have. See also
<CODE>skip_show_database</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>server_id</CODE>

The value of the <CODE>--server-id</CODE> option.

<LI><CODE>skip_locking</CODE>

Is OFF if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses external locking.

<LI><CODE>skip_networking</CODE>

Is ON if we only allow local (socket) connections.

<LI><CODE>skip_show_database</CODE>

This prevents people from doing <CODE>SHOW DATABASES</CODE> if they don't have
the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege. This can improve security if you're
concerned about people being able to see what databases other users
have. See also <CODE>safe_show_database</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE>

Number of seconds to wait for more data from a master/slave connection
before aborting the read.

<LI><CODE>slow_launch_time</CODE>

If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in seconds), the
<CODE>Slow_launch_threads</CODE> counter will be incremented.

<LI><CODE>socket</CODE>

The Unix socket used by the server.

<LI><CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE>

Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this
size. Increase this value for faster <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
operations.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<LI><CODE>table_cache</CODE>

The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
increases the number of file descriptors that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> requires.
You can check if you need to increase the table cache by checking the
<CODE>Opened_tables</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.6.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.
If this variable
is big and you don't do <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> a lot (which just forces all
tables to be closed and reopenend), then you should increase the value of this
variable.

For more information about the table cache, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.7  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<LI><CODE>table_type</CODE>

The default table type.

<LI><CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE>

How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse.  When a
client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there
aren't more than <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> threads from before.  All new
threads are first taken from the cache, and only when the cache is empty
is a new thread created.  This variable can be increased to improve
performance if you have a lot of new connections. (Normally this doesn't
give a notable performance improvement if you have a good
thread implementation.)  By examing the difference between
the <CODE>Connections</CODE> and <CODE>Threads_created</CODE> status variables 
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.6.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A> for details) you can see how efficient  
thread cache is.

<LI><CODE>thread_concurrency</CODE>

On Solaris, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will call <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> with
this value.  <CODE>thr_setconcurrency()</CODE> permits the application to give
the threads system a hint for the desired number of threads that should
be run at the same time.

<LI><CODE>thread_stack</CODE>

The stack size for each thread.  Many of the limits detected by the
<CODE>crash-me</CODE> test are dependent on this value. The default is
large enough for normal operation.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>.

<LI><CODE>timezone</CODE>

The timezone for the server.

<LI><CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>

If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL
will automatically convert it to an on-disk <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
Increase the value of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> if you do many advanced
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> queries and you have lots of memory.

<LI><CODE>tmpdir</CODE>

The directory used for temporary files and temporary tables.
Starting from MySQL 4.1, it can be set to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion. This feature can be used to
spread load between several physical disks.

<LI><CODE>version</CODE>

The version number for the server.

<LI><CODE>wait_timeout</CODE>

The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a not interactive
connection before closing it.

On thread startup <CODE>SESSION.WAIT_TIMEOUT</CODE> is initialised from
<CODE>GLOBAL.WAIT_TIMEOUT</CODE> or <CODE>GLOBAL.INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT</CODE> depending
on the type of client (as defined by the <CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> connect
option). See also <CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE>.

<UL>
<LI><CODE>Checking table</CODE>

The thread is performing [automatic] checking of the table.
<LI><CODE>Closing tables</CODE>

Means that the thread is flushing the changed table data to disk and
closing the used tables. This should be a fast operation.  If not, then
you should check that you don't have a full disk or that the disk is not
in very heavy use.
<LI><CODE>Connect Out</CODE>

Slave connecting to master.
<LI><CODE>Copying to tmp table on disk</CODE>

The temporary result set was larger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> and the
thread is now changing the in memory-based temporary table to a disk
based one to save memory.
<LI><CODE>Creating tmp table</CODE>

The thread is creating a temporary table to hold a part of the result for
the query.
<LI><CODE>deleting from main table</CODE>

When executing the first part of a multi-table delete and we are only
deleting from the first table.
<LI><CODE>deleting from reference tables</CODE>

When executing the second part of a multi-table delete and we are deleting
the matched rows from the other tables.
<LI><CODE>Flushing tables</CODE>

The thread is executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> and is waiting for all
threads to close their tables.
<LI><CODE>Killed</CODE>

Someone has sent a kill to the thread and it should abort next time it
checks the kill flag.  The flag is checked in each major loop in MySQL,
but in some cases it may still take a short time for the thread to die.
If the thread is locked by some other thread, the kill will take affect
as soon as the other thread releases it's lock.
<LI><CODE>Sending data</CODE>

The thread is processing rows for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement and is
also sending data to the client.
<LI><CODE>Sorting for group</CODE>

The thread is doing a sort to satsify a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Sorting for order</CODE>

The thread is doing a sort to satsify a <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Opening tables</CODE>

This simply means that the thread is trying to open a table. This is
should be very fast procedure, unless something prevents opening. For
example an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or a <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> can prevent opening
a table until the command is finished.
<LI><CODE>Removing duplicates</CODE>

The query was using <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> in such a way that MySQL
couldn't optimise that distinct away at an early stage. Because of this
MySQL has to do an extra stage to remove all duplicated rows before
sending the result to the client.
<LI><CODE>Reopen table</CODE>

The thread got a lock for the table, but noticed after getting the lock
that the underlying table structure changed. It has freed the lock,
closed the table and is now trying to reopen it.
<LI><CODE>Repair by sorting</CODE>

The repair code is using sorting to create indexes.
<LI><CODE>Repair with keycache</CODE>

The repair code is using creating keys one by one through the key cache.
This is much slower than <CODE>Repair by sorting</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Searching rows for update</CODE>

The thread is doing a first phase to find all matching rows before
updating them.  This has to be done if the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> is changing
the index that is used to find the involved rows.
<LI><CODE>Sleeping</CODE>

The thread is wating for the client to send a new command to it.
<LI><CODE>System lock</CODE>

The thread is waiting for getting to get a external system lock for the
table. If you are not using multiple mysqld servers that are accessing
the same tables, you can disable system locks with the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option.
<LI><CODE>Upgrading lock</CODE>

The <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> handler is trying to get a lock for the table
to insert rows.
<LI><CODE>Updating</CODE>

The thread is searching for rows to update and updating them.
<LI><CODE>User Lock</CODE>

The thread is waiting on a <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>Waiting for tables</CODE>

The thread got a notification that the underlying structure for a table
has changed and it needs to reopen the table to get the new structure.
To be able to reopen the table it must however wait until all other
threads have closed the table in question.

This notification happens if another thread has used <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>
or one of the following commands on the table in question: <CODE>FLUSH
TABLES table_name</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>waiting for handler insert</CODE>

The <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> handler has processed all inserts and are
waiting to get new ones.

Most states are very quick operations. If threads last in any of these
states for many seconds, there may be a problem around that needs to be
investigated.

<P>
There are some other states that are not mentioned previously, but most of
these are only useful to find bugs in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Character_sets" HREF="manual_toc.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX632"></A>
<A NAME="IDX633"></A>
<A NAME="IDX634"></A>

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL uses the ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) character set
with sorting according to Swedish/Finnish. This is the character set suitable
in the USA and western Europe.

</P>
<P>
All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-charsets=complex</CODE>.  This will add code to all
standard programs to be able to handle <CODE>latin1</CODE> and all multi-byte
character sets within the binary. Other character sets will be
loaded from a character-set definition file when needed.

</P>
<P>
The character set determines what characters are allowed in names and how
things are sorted by the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses of
the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
You can change the character set with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>
option when you start the server.  The character sets available depend
on the <CODE>--with-charset=charset</CODE> and <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=
list-of-charset | complex | all</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>, and the
character set configuration files listed in
<TT>`SHAREDIR/charsets/Index'</TT>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you change the character set when running MySQL (which may
also change the sort order), you must run <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
--set-character-set=charset</CODE> on all
tables. Otherwise, your indexes may not be ordered correctly.

</P>
<P>
When a client connects to a MySQL server, the server sends the
default character set in use to the client.  The client will switch to
use this character set for this connection.

</P>
<P>
One should use <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> when escaping strings
for a SQL query.  <CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> is identical to the
old <CODE>mysql_escape_string()</CODE> function, except that it takes the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
connection handle as the first parameter.

</P>
<P>
If the client is compiled with different paths than where the server is
installed and the user who configured MySQL didn't include all
character sets in the MySQL binary, one must specify for
the client where it can find the additional character sets it will need
if the server runs with a different character set than the client.

</P>
<P>
One can specify this by putting in a MySQL option file:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
character-sets-dir=/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets
</PRE>

<P>
where the path points to the directory in which the dynamic MySQL character
sets are stored.

</P>
<P>
One can force the client to use specific character set by specifying:

</P>

<PRE>
[client]
default-character-set=character-set-name
</PRE>

<P>
but normally this is never needed.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="German_character_set" HREF="manual_toc.html#German_character_set">4.6.1.1  German character set</A></H4>

<P>
To get German sorting order, you should start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--default-character-set=latin1_de</CODE>.  This will give you the following
characteristics.

</P>
<P>
When sorting and comparing string's the following mapping is done on the
strings before doing the comparison:

</P>

<PRE>
ä  -&#62;  ae
ö  -&#62;  oe
ü  -&#62;  ue
ß  -&#62;  ss
</PRE>

<P>
All accented characters, are converted to their un-accented uppercase
counterpart.  All letters are converted to uppercase.

</P>
<P>
When comparing strings with <CODE>LIKE</CODE> the one -&#62; two character mapping
is not done. All letters are converted to uppercase. Accent are removed
from all letters except: <CODE>Ü</CODE>, <CODE>ü</CODE>, <CODE>Ö</CODE>, <CODE>ö</CODE>,
<CODE>Ä</CODE> and <CODE>ä</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX636"></A>
<A NAME="IDX637"></A>
<A NAME="IDX638"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> can issue error messages in the following languages:
Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (the default), Estonian, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Norwegian-ny, Polish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish.

</P>
<P>
To start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a particular language, use either the
<CODE>--language=lang</CODE> or <CODE>-L lang</CODE> options. For example:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --language=swedish
</PRE>

<P>
or:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld --language=/usr/local/share/swedish
</PRE>

<P>
Note that all language names are specified in lowercase.

</P>
<P>
The language files are located (by default) in
<TT>`<VAR>mysql_base_dir</VAR>/share/<VAR>LANGUAGE</VAR>/'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
To update the error message file, you should edit the <TT>`errmsg.txt'</TT> file
and execute the following command to generate the <TT>`errmsg.sys'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; comp_err errmsg.txt errmsg.sys
</PRE>

<P>
If you upgrade to a newer version of MySQL, remember to repeat
your changes with the new <TT>`errmsg.txt'</TT> file.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Adding_character_set" HREF="manual_toc.html#Adding_character_set">4.6.3  Adding a New Character Set</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX639"></A>
<A NAME="IDX640"></A>

</P>
<P>
To add another character set to MySQL, use the following procedure.

</P>
<P>
Decide if the set is simple or complex.  If the character set
does not need to use special string collating routines for
sorting and does not need multi-byte character support, it is
simple.  If it needs either of those features, it is complex.

</P>
<P>
For example, <CODE>latin1</CODE> and <CODE>danish</CODE> are simple charactersets while
<CODE>big5</CODE> or <CODE>czech</CODE> are complex character sets.

</P>
<P>
In the following section, we have assumed that you name your character
set <CODE>MYSET</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a simple character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file
Assign a unique number to it.

<LI>

Create the file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/MYSET.conf'</TT>.
(You can use <TT>`sql/share/charsets/latin1.conf'</TT> as a base for this.)

The syntax for the file very simple:


<UL>
<LI>

Comments start with a '#' character and proceed to the end of the line.
<LI>

Words are separated by arbitrary amounts of whitespace.
<LI>

When defining the character set, every word must be a number in hexadecimal
format
<LI>

The <CODE>ctype</CODE> array takes up the first 257 words. The
<CODE>to_lower[]</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> and <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> arrays take up
256 words each after that.
</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.

</OL>

<P>
For a complex character set do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Create the file <TT>`strings/ctype-MYSET.c'</TT> in the MySQL source
distribution.

<LI>

Add MYSET to the end of the <TT>`sql/share/charsets/Index'</TT> file.
Assign a unique number to it.

<LI>

Look at one of the existing <TT>`ctype-*.c'</TT> files to see what needs to
be defined, for example <TT>`strings/ctype-big5.c'</TT>. Note that the
arrays in your file must have names like <CODE>ctype_MYSET</CODE>,
<CODE>to_lower_MYSET</CODE>, and so on.  This corresponds to the arrays
in the simple character set. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A>.  For a complex
character set

<LI>

Near the top of the file, place a special comment like this:


<PRE>
/*
 * This comment is parsed by configure to create ctype.c,
 * so don't change it unless you know what you are doing.
 *
 * .configure. number_MYSET=MYNUMBER
 * .configure. strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N
 * .configure. mbmaxlen_MYSET=N
 */
</PRE>

The <CODE>configure</CODE> program uses this comment to include
the character set into the MySQL library automatically.

The strxfrm_multiply and mbmaxlen lines will be explained in
the following sections.  Only include these if you need the string
collating functions or the multi-byte character set functions,
respectively.

<LI>

You should then create some of the following functions:


<UL>
<LI><CODE>my_strncoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strcoll_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_strxfrm_MYSET()</CODE>

<LI><CODE>my_like_range_MYSET()</CODE>

</UL>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

<LI>

Add the character set name to the <CODE>CHARSETS_AVAILABLE</CODE> and
<CODE>COMPILED_CHARSETS</CODE> lists in <CODE>configure.in</CODE>.

<LI>

Reconfigure, recompile, and test.
</OL>

<P>
The file <TT>`sql/share/charsets/README'</TT> includes some more instructions.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have the character set included in the MySQL
distribution, mail a patch to <a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Character_arrays" HREF="manual_toc.html#Character_arrays">4.6.4  The Character Definition Arrays</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>to_lower[]</CODE> and <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> are simple arrays that hold the
lowercase and uppercase characters corresponding to each member of the
character set.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
to_lower['A'] should contain 'a'
to_upper['a'] should contain 'A'
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> is a map indicating how characters should be ordered for
comparison and sorting purposes. Quite often (but not for all character sets)
this is the same as <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE> (which means sorting will be
case-insensitive). MySQL will sort characters based on the value of
<CODE>sort_order[character]</CODE>.  For more complicated sorting rules, see
the discussion of string collating below. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_collating">4.6.5  String Collating Support</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is an array of bit values, with one element for one character.
(Note that <CODE>to_lower[]</CODE>, <CODE>to_upper[]</CODE>, and <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE>
are indexed by character value, but <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> is indexed by character
value + 1.  This is an old legacy to be able to handle <CODE>EOF</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
You can find the following bitmask definitions in <TT>`m_ctype.h'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
#define _U      01      /* Uppercase */
#define _L      02      /* Lowercase */
#define _N      04      /* Numeral (digit) */
#define _S      010     /* Spacing character */
#define _P      020     /* Punctuation */
#define _C      040     /* Control character */
#define _B      0100    /* Blank */
#define _X      0200    /* heXadecimal digit */
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>ctype[]</CODE> entry for each character should be the union of the
applicable bitmask values that describe the character.  For example,
<CODE>'A'</CODE> is an uppercase character (<CODE>_U</CODE>) as well as a
hexadecimal digit (<CODE>_X</CODE>), so <CODE>ctype['A'+1]</CODE> should contain the
value:

</P>

<PRE>
_U + _X = 01 + 0200 = 0201
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX642"></A>

</P>
<P>
If the sorting rules for your language are too complex to be handled
with the simple <CODE>sort_order[]</CODE> table, you need to use the string
collating functions.

</P>
<P>
Right now the best documentation on this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the <CODE>big5</CODE>, <CODE>czech</CODE>, <CODE>gbk</CODE>,
<CODE>sjis</CODE>, and <CODE>tis160</CODE> character sets for examples.

</P>
<P>
You must specify the <CODE>strxfrm_multiply_MYSET=N</CODE> value in the
special comment at the top of the file.  <CODE>N</CODE> should be set to
the maximum ratio the strings may grow during <CODE>my_strxfrm_MYSET</CODE> (it
must be a positive integer).

<P>
<A NAME="IDX643"></A>

</P>
<P>
If your want to add support for a new character set that includes
multi-byte characters, you need to use the multi-byte character
functions.

</P>
<P>
Right now the best documentation on this is the character sets that are
already implemented.  Look at the <CODE>euc_kr</CODE>, <CODE>gb2312</CODE>,
<CODE>gbk</CODE>, <CODE>sjis</CODE>, and <CODE>ujis</CODE> character sets for
examples. These are implemented in the <TT>`ctype-'charset'.c'</TT> files
in the <TT>`strings'</TT> directory.

</P>
<P>
You must specify the <CODE>mbmaxlen_MYSET=N</CODE> value in the special
comment at the top of the source file.  <CODE>N</CODE> should be set to the
size in bytes of the largest character in the set.

you can run into a couple of different problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Your program has a wrong path to where the character sets are stored.
(Default <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets'</TT>).
This can be fixed by using the <CODE>--character-sets-dir</CODE>
option to the program in question.
<LI>

The character set is a multi-byte character set that can't be loaded
dynamically.  In this case you have to recompile the program with the
support for the character set.
<LI>

The character set is a dynamic character set, but you don't have a
configure file for it.  In this case you should install the configure
file for the character set from a new MySQL distribution.
<LI>

Your <TT>`Index'</TT> file doesn't contain the name for the character set.


<PRE>
ERROR 1105: File '/usr/local/share/mysql/charsets/?.conf' not found
(Errcode: 2)
</PRE>

In this case you should either get a new <CODE>Index</CODE> file or add
by hand the name of any missing character sets.
</UL>

<P>
For <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can check the character set name and number for a
table with <CODE>myisamchk -dvv table_name</CODE>.

The following list briefly describes the server-side MySQL programs:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX647"></A>
 
Utility to describe, check, optimise, and repair MySQL tables.
Because <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> has many functions, it is described in its own
chapter. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<A NAME="IDX648"></A>
<DT><CODE>make_binary_distribution</CODE>
<DD>
Makes a binary release of a compiled MySQL. This could be sent
by FTP to <TT>`/pub/mysql/Incoming'</TT> on <CODE>support.mysql.com</CODE> for the
convenience of other MySQL users.

<A NAME="IDX649"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlbug</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL bug report script.  This script should always be used when
filing a bug report to the MySQL list.

<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DD>
The SQL daemon. This should always be running.

<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>
<DD>
Creates the MySQL grant tables with default privileges. This is
usually executed only once, when first installing MySQL
on a system.

Note that in MySQL 4.0 <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> was renamed to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> is the recommended way to start a <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
daemon on Unix.  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> adds some safety features such as
restarting the server when an error occurs and logging run-time
information to a log file.

</P>
<P>
If you don't use <CODE>--mysqld=#</CODE> or <CODE>--mysqld-version=#</CODE>
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will use an executable named <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> if it
exists. If not, <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
This makes it very easy to test to use <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> instead of
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>; just copy <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> to where you have
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and it will be used.

</P>
<P>
Normally one should never edit the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script, but
instead put the options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> in the
<CODE>[safe_mysqld]</CODE> section in the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file. <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will read all options from the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE>,
<CODE>[server]</CODE> and <CODE>[safe_mysqld]</CODE> sections from the option files.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that all options on the command-line to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> are passed
to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  If you wants to use any options in <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> that
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't support, you must specify these in the option file.

</P>
<P>
Most of the options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> are the same as the options to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

<P>
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--basedir=path</CODE>

<DT><CODE>--core-file-size=#</CODE>
<DD>
Size of the core file <CODE>mysqld</CODE> should be able to create. Passed to <CODE>ulimit -c</CODE>.

<DD>
Write the error log to the above file. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.
<DT><CODE>--ledir=path</CODE>
<DD>
Path to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<DT><CODE>--log=path</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--mysqld=mysqld-version</CODE>
<DD>
Name of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version in the <CODE>ledir</CODE> directory you want to start.
<DT><CODE>--mysqld-version=version</CODE>
<DD>
Similar to <CODE>--mysqld=</CODE> but here you only give the suffix for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
For example if you use <CODE>--mysqld-version=max</CODE>, <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will
start the <CODE>ledir/mysqld-max</CODE> version.  If the argument to
<CODE>--mysqld-version</CODE> is empty, <CODE>ledir/mysqld</CODE> will be used.
<DT><CODE>--no-defaults</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE>
<DD>
Number of files <CODE>mysqld</CODE> should be able to open. Passed to <CODE>ulimit -n</CODE>. Note that you need to start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as root for this to work properly!
<DT><CODE>--pid-file=path</CODE>

<P>
The <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script is written so that it normally is able to start
a server that was installed from either a source or a binary version of
MySQL, even if these install the server in slightly different
locations.  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> expects one of these conditions to be true:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The server and databases can be found relative to the directory from which
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> is invoked.  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> looks under its working
directory for <TT>`bin'</TT> and <TT>`data'</TT> directories (for binary
distributions) or for <TT>`libexec'</TT> and <TT>`var'</TT> directories (for source
distributions).  This condition should be met if you execute
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> from your MySQL installation directory (for
example, <TT>`/usr/local/mysql'</TT> for a binary distribution).

<LI>

If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working directory,
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> attempts to locate them by absolute pathnames.  Typical
locations are <TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT> and <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>.
The actual locations are determined when the distribution was built from which
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> comes.  They should be correct if
MySQL was installed in a standard location.
</UL>

<P>
Because <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will try to find the server and databases relative
to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
MySQL anywhere, as long as you start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> from the
MySQL installation directory:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql_installation_directory
shell&#62; bin/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> fails, even when invoked from the MySQL
installation directory, you can modify it to use the path to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
and the pathname options that are correct for your system.  Note that if you
upgrade MySQL in the future, your modified version of
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will be overwritten, so you should make a copy of your
edited version that you can reinstall.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="mysqld_multi" HREF="manual_toc.html#mysqld_multi">4.7.3  <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, A Program for Managing Multiple MySQL Servers</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX656"></A>
<A NAME="IDX657"></A>
<A NAME="IDX658"></A>
<A NAME="IDX659"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> is meant for managing several <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
processes that listen for connections on different Unix sockets and
TCP/IP ports.

</P>
<P>
The program will search for group(s) named <CODE>[mysqld#]</CODE> from
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> (or the file named by the <CODE>--config-file=...</CODE> option),
where <CODE>#</CODE> can be any positive number starting from 1.  This number
is referred to in the following discussion as the option group number,
or GNR.  Group numbers distinquish option groups from one another and are
used as arguments to <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> to specify which servers you want
to start, stop, or obtain status for.  Options listed in these groups
should be the same as you would use in the usual <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE>
group used for starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  (See, for example, section <A HREF="manual.html#Automatic_start">2.4.3  Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically</A>.)  However, for <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, be sure that each group
includes options for values such as the port, socket, etc., to be used
for each individual <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> is invoked using the following syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
Usage: mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR,GNR,GNR...]
or     mysqld_multi [OPTIONS] {start|stop|report} [GNR-GNR,GNR,GNR-GNR,...]
</PRE>

<P>
Each
GNR represents an option group number. You can start, stop or report
any GNR, or several of them at the same time. For an example of how you
might set up an option file, use this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld_multi --example
</PRE>

<P>
The GNR values in the list can be comma-separated or combined with a dash;
in the latter case, all the GNRs between GNR1-GNR2 will be affected. With
no GNR argument, all groups listed in the option file will be either
started, stopped, or reported. Note that you must not have any white
spaces in the GNR list. Anything after a white space is ignored.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--config-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
 
Alternative config file. Note: This will not affect this program's own
options (group <CODE>[mysqld_multi]</CODE>), but only groups
<CODE>[mysqld#]</CODE>. Without this option, everything will be searched from the
ordinary <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file.
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
<DT><CODE>--example</CODE>
<DD>
Display an example option file.
<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Print this help and exit.
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<DT><CODE>--log=...</CODE>
<DD>
Log file. Full path to and the name for the log file. Note: If the file
exists, everything will be appended.
<A NAME="IDX664"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqladmin=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> binary to be used for a server shutdown.
<A NAME="IDX665"></A>
<DT><CODE>--mysqld=...</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary to be used. Note that you can give
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to this option also. The options are passed to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. Just make sure you have <CODE>mysqld</CODE> in your environment
variable <CODE>PATH</CODE> or fix <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX666"></A>
<DT><CODE>--no-log</CODE>
<DD>
Print to stdout instead of the log file. By default the log file is
turned on.
<A NAME="IDX667"></A>
<DT><CODE>--password=...</CODE>
<DD>
Password for user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX668"></A>
<DT><CODE>--tcp-ip</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to the MySQL server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead of
the Unix socket. This affects stopping and reporting.  If a socket file
is missing, the server may still be running, but can be accessed only
via the TCP/IP port.  By default, connections are made using the Unix socket.
<A NAME="IDX669"></A>
<DT><CODE>--user=...</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL user for <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX670"></A>
<DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD>
Print the version number and exit.
</DL>

<P>
Some notes about <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure that the MySQL user, who is stopping the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> services (e.g using the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> program) have the same
password and username for all the data directories accessed (to the
<CODE>mysql</CODE> database) And make sure that the user has the <CODE>SHUTDOWN</CODE>
privilege! If you have many data directories and many different <CODE>mysql</CODE>
databases with different passwords for the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user,
you may want to create a common <CODE>multi_admin</CODE> user for each using the
same password (see below). Example how to do it:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -proot_password -e
"GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.* TO multi_admin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'multipass'"
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges">4.2.6  How the Privilege System Works</A>.
You will have to do the above for each <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running in each
data directory, that you have (just change the socket, <CODE>-S=...</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>pid-file</CODE> is very important, if you are using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (e.g., <CODE>--mysqld=safe_mysqld</CODE>) Every
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> should have its own <CODE>pid-file</CODE>. The advantage
using <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> instead of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> directly here is,
that <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> ``guards'' every <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process and will
restart it, if a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process terminates due to a signal
sent using <CODE>kill -9</CODE>, or for other reasons such as a segmentation
fault (which MySQL should never do, of course ;). Please note that the
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script may require that you start it from a certain
place. This means that you may have to <CODE>cd</CODE> to a certain directory,
before you start the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>. If you have problems starting,
please see the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script. Check especially the lines:


<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY_PWD=`pwd` Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary
release) if test -d /data/mysql -a -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys
-a -x ./bin/mysqld
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.
The above test should be successful, or you may encounter problems.
<LI>

Beware of the dangers starting multiple <CODE>mysqld</CODE>s in the same data
directory.  Use separate data directories, unless you <STRONG>know</STRONG> what
you are doing!
<LI>

The socket file and the TCP/IP port must be different for every <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

The first and fifth <CODE>mysqld</CODE> group were intentionally left out from
the example.  You may have 'gaps' in the config file. This gives you
more flexibility.  The order in which the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE> are started or
stopped depends on the order in which they appear in the config file.
<LI>

When you want to refer to a certain group using GNR with this program,
just use the number in the end of the group name.
For example, the GNR for a group named <CODE>[mysqld17]</CODE> is 17.
<LI>

You may want to use option <CODE>--user</CODE> for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, but in order to
do this you need to run the <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE> script as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE>
user. Having the option in the config file doesn't matter; you will
just get a warning, if you are not the superuser and the <CODE>mysqlds</CODE>
are started under <STRONG>your</STRONG> Unix account. <STRONG>Important</STRONG>: Make
sure that the <CODE>pid-file</CODE> and the data directory are
read+write(+execute for the latter one) accessible for <STRONG>that</STRONG>
Unix user, who the specific <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is started
as. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> use the Unix root account for this, unless you
<STRONG>know</STRONG> what you are doing!
<LI>

<STRONG>Most important</STRONG>: Make sure that you understand the meanings of
the options that are passed to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>s and <STRONG>why one
would want</STRONG> to have separate <CODE>mysqld</CODE> processes. Starting multiple
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>s in one data directory <STRONG>will not</STRONG> give you extra
performance in a threaded system!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is used to compress MyISAM tables, and <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>
is used to compress ISAM tables. Because ISAM tables are deprecated, we
will only discuss <CODE>myisampack</CODE> here, but everything said about
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> should also be true for <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> works by compressing each column in the table separately.
The information needed to decompress columns is read into memory when the
table is opened. This results in much better performance when accessing
individual records, because you only have to uncompress exactly one record, not
a much larger disk block as when using Stacker on MS-DOS.
Usually, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the datafile 40%-70%.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses memory mapping (<CODE>mmap()</CODE>) on compressed tables and
falls back to normal read/write file usage if <CODE>mmap()</CODE> doesn't work.

</P>
<P>
Please note the following:

<UL>
<LI>

After packing, the table is read-only. This is generally intended
(such as when accessing packed tables on a CD). Also allowing writes
to a packed table is on our TODO list but with low priority.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can also pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
The older <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> (for <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables) can not do this.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisampack [options] filename ...
</PRE>

<P>
Each filename should be the name of an index (<TT>`.MYI'</TT>) file.  If you
are not in the database directory, you should specify the pathname to the
file.  It is permissible to omit the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> extension.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-b, --backup</CODE>
<DD>
Make a backup of the table as <CODE>tbl_name.OLD</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=debug_options</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. The <CODE>debug_options</CODE> string often is
<CODE>'d:t:o,filename'</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Force packing of the table even if it becomes bigger or if the temporary file
exists.  <CODE>myisampack</CODE> creates a temporary file named <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT>
while it compresses the table.  If you kill <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, the <TT>`.TMD'</TT>
file may not be deleted.  Normally, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> exits with an error if
it finds that <TT>`tbl_name.TMD'</TT> exists.  With <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> packs the table anyway.

<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>-j big_tbl_name, --join=big_tbl_name</CODE>
<DD>
Join all tables named on the command-line into a single table
<CODE>big_tbl_name</CODE>.  All tables that are to be combined
<STRONG>must</STRONG> be identical (same column names and types, same indexes, etc.).

<DT><CODE>-p #, --packlength=#</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the record length storage size, in bytes.  The value should be 1, 2,
or 3.  (<CODE>myisampack</CODE> stores all rows with length pointers of 1, 2, or 3
bytes.  In most normal cases, <CODE>myisampack</CODE> can determine the right length
value before it begins packing the file, but it may notice during the packing
process that it could have used a shorter length. In this case,
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> will print a note that the next time you pack the same file,
you could use a shorter record length.)

<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

<DT><CODE>-t, --test</CODE>
<DD>
Don't actually pack table, just test packing it.

<DT><CODE>-T dir_name, --tmp_dir=dir_name</CODE>
<DD>
Use the named directory as the location in which to write the temporary table.

<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Write information about progress and packing result.

<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Display version information and exit.

<DT><CODE>-w, --wait</CODE>
<DD>
Wait and retry if table is in use.  If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server was
invoked with the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option, it is not a good idea
to invoke <CODE>myisampack</CODE> if the table might be updated during the
packing process.

The information printed by <CODE>myisampack</CODE> is described here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>normal</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns for which no extra packing is used.

<DT><CODE>empty-space</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns containing
values that are only spaces; these will occupy 1 bit.

<DT><CODE>empty-zero</CODE>

The number of columns containing
values that are only binary 0's; these will occupy 1 bit.

<DT><CODE>empty-fill</CODE>
<DD>
The number of integer columns that don't occupy the full byte range of their
type; these are changed to a smaller type (for example, an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>
column may be changed to <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>).

<DT><CODE>pre-space</CODE>
<DD>
The number of decimal columns that are stored with leading spaces. In this
case, each value will contain a count for the number of leading spaces.

<DT><CODE>end-space</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns that have a lot of trailing spaces.  In this case, each
value will contain a count for the number of trailing spaces.

<DT><CODE>table-lookup</CODE>
<DD>
The column had only a small number of different values, which were
converted to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> before Huffman compression.

<DT><CODE>zero</CODE>
<DD>
The number of columns for which all values are zero.

<DT><CODE>Original trees</CODE>
<DD>
The initial number of Huffman trees.

<DT><CODE>After join</CODE>
<DD>
The number of distinct Huffman trees left after joining
trees to save some header space.
</DL>

<P>
After a table has been compressed, <CODE>myisamchk -dvv</CODE> prints additional
information about each field:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Type</CODE>
<DD>
The field type may contain the following descriptors:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>constant</CODE>
<DD>
All rows have the same value.

<DT><CODE>no endspace</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace.

<DT><CODE>no endspace, not_always</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace and don't do end space compression for all values.

<DT><CODE>no endspace, no empty</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store endspace. Don't store empty values.

<DT><CODE>table-lookup</CODE>
<DD>
The column was converted to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>zerofill(n)</CODE>
<DD>
The most significant <CODE>n</CODE> bytes in the value are always 0 and are not
stored.

<DT><CODE>no zeros</CODE>
<DD>
Don't store zeros.

<DT><CODE>always zero</CODE>
<DD>
0 values are stored in 1 bit.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>Huff tree</CODE>
<DD>
The Huffman tree associated with the field.

<DT><CODE>Bits</CODE>
<DD>
The number of bits used in the Huffman tree.
</DL>

<P>
After you have run <CODE>pack_isam</CODE>/<CODE>myisampack</CODE> you must run
<CODE>isamchk</CODE>/<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to re-create the index.  At this time you
can also sort the index blocks and create statistics needed for
the MySQL optimiser to work more efficiently:

</P>

<PRE>
myisamchk -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.MYI
isamchk   -rq --analyze --sort-index table_name.ISM
</PRE>

<P>
After you have installed the packed table into the MySQL database
directory you should do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> to force <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
to start using the new table.

</P>
<P>
If you want to unpack a packed table, you can do this with the
<CODE>--unpack</CODE> option to <CODE>isamchk</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The Windows MySQL binary distributions includes both the

See section <A HREF="manual.html#Windows_installation">2.1.2  Installing MySQL on Windows</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that as InnoDB and Berkeley DB are not available for all platforms,
some of the <CODE>Max</CODE> binaries may not have support for both of these.
You can check which table types are supported by doing the following
query:

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>:  To be able to create InnoDB tables you <STRONG>must</STRONG> edit
your startup options to include at least the <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>
option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.2  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
To get better performance for BDB tables, you should add some configuration

</P>
<P>
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will automatically try to start any <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary
with the <CODE>-max</CODE> suffix. This makes it very easy to test out a
another <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary in an existing installation.  Just
run <CODE>configure</CODE> with the options you want and then install the
new <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary as <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> in the same directory
where your old <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary is. See section <A HREF="manual.html#safe_mysqld">4.7.2  <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, The Wrapper Around <CODE>mysqld</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> RPM uses the above mentioned <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
feature. It just installs the <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE> executable and
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> will automatically use this executable when
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> is restarted.

The following list briefly describes the client-side MySQL programs:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX695"></A>
 
A shell script that converts <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to MySQL. It doesn't
handle all cases, but it gives a good start when converting.

<A NAME="IDX696"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>
<DD>
A script that checks the access privileges for a host, user, and database
combination.

<A NAME="IDX697"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>
<DD>
Utility for performing administrative operations, such as creating or
dropping databases, reloading the grant tables, flushing tables to disk, and
reopening log files.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> can also be used to retrieve version,
process, and status information from the server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqladmin">4.8.3  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, Administrating a MySQL Server</A>.

<A NAME="IDX698"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqldump</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a MySQL database into a file as SQL statements or
as tab-separated text files. Enhanced freeware originally by Igor Romanenko.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqldump">4.8.5  <CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, Dumping Table Structure and Data</A>.

<A NAME="IDX699"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>
<DD>
Imports text files into their respective tables using <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlimport">4.8.7  <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>, Importing Data from Text Files</A>.

<A NAME="IDX700"></A>
<DT><CODE>mysqlshow</CODE>
<DD>
Displays information about databases, tables, columns, and indexes.

<A NAME="IDX701"></A>
<DT><CODE>replace</CODE>
<DD>
A utility program that is used by <CODE>msql2mysql</CODE>, but that has more
general applicability as well.  <CODE>replace</CODE> changes strings in place in
files or on the standard input. Uses a finite state machine to match longer
strings first. Can be used to swap strings. For example, this command
swaps <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE> in the given files:


<PRE>
shell&#62; replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

<CODE>mysql</CODE> is a simple SQL shell (with GNU <CODE>readline</CODE> capabilities).
It supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used interactively,
query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When used
non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
tab-separated format.  (The output format can be changed using command-line
options.)  You can run scripts simply like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql database &#60; script.sql &#62; output.tab
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems due to insufficient memory in the client, use the
<CODE>--quick</CODE> option!  This forces <CODE>mysql</CODE> to use
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> rather than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to
retrieve the result set.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>mysql</CODE> is very easy. Just start it as follows:
<CODE>mysql database</CODE> or <CODE>mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password database</CODE>. Type a SQL statement, end it with <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\g'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`\G'</SAMP>
and press Enter.

If the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client loses connection to the server while
sending it a query, it will immediately and automatically try to
reconnect once to the server and send the query again.
Note that even if it succeeds in reconnecting, as your first
connection has ended, all your previous session objects are lost : temporary
tables, user and session variables. Therefore, the above behaviour may
be dangerous for you, like in this example where the server was shut
down and restarted without you knowing it :

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; set @a=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql&#62; insert into t values(@a);
ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...

+------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>@a</CODE> user variable has been lost with the connection, and
after the reconnection it is undefined.
To protect from this risk, you can start the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client
with the <CODE>--disable-reconnect</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
If you type 'help' on the command-line, <CODE>mysql</CODE> will print out the
commands that it supports:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX759"></A>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; help

MySQL commands:
help    (\h)    Display this text.
?       (\h)    Synonym for `help'.
clear   (\c)    Clear command.
connect (\r)    Reconnect to the server.
                Optional arguments are db and host.
edit    (\e)    Edit command with $EDITOR.
ego     (\G)    Send command to mysql server,
                display result vertically.
exit    (\q)    Exit mysql. Same as quit.
go      (\g)    Send command to mysql server.
nopager (\n)    Disable pager, print to stdout.
notee   (\t)    Don't write into outfile.
pager   (\P)    Set PAGER [to_pager].
                Print the query results via PAGER.
print   (\p)    Print current command.
prompt  (\R)    Change your mysql prompt.
quit    (\q)    Quit mysql.
rehash  (\#)    Rebuild completion hash.
source  (\.)    Execute a SQL script file.
                Takes a file name as an argument.
status  (\s)    Get status information from the server.
tee     (\T)    Set outfile [to_outfile].
                Append everything into given outfile.
use     (\u)    Use another database.
                Takes database name as argument.
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>pager</CODE> command works only in Unix.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX760"></A>
The <CODE>status</CODE> command gives you some information about the
connection and the server you are using. If you are running in the
<CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> mode, <CODE>status</CODE> will also print the values for
the <CODE>mysql</CODE> variables that affect your queries.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX761"></A>
A useful startup option for beginners (introduced in MySQL
Version 3.23.11) is <CODE>--safe-updates</CODE> (or <CODE>--i-am-a-dummy</CODE> for
users that has at some time done a <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> but
forgot the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause).  When using this option, <CODE>mysql</CODE>
sends the following command to the MySQL server when opening
the connection:

</P>

<PRE>
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=#select_limit#,
    SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=#max_join_size#"
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> and <CODE>#max_join_size#</CODE> are variables that
can be set from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The effect of the above is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are not allowed to do an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement
if you don't have a key constraint in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part. One can,
however, force an <CODE>UPDATE/DELETE</CODE> by using <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET not_key_column=# WHERE not_key_column=# LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

All big results are automatically limited to <CODE>#select_limit#</CODE> rows.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>#max_join_size</CODE> row combinations will be aborted.
</UL>

<P>
Some useful hints about the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client:

</P>
<P>
Some data is much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of
the usual horizontal box type output. For example longer text, which
includes new lines, is often much easier to be read with vertical
output.

For logging, you can use the <CODE>tee</CODE> option. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be
started with option <CODE>--tee=...</CODE>, or from the command-line
interactively with command <CODE>tee</CODE>. All the data displayed on the
screen will also be appended into a given file. This can be very useful
for debugging purposes also. The <CODE>tee</CODE> can be disabled from the
command-line with command <CODE>notee</CODE>. Executing <CODE>tee</CODE> again
starts logging again. Without a parameter the previous file will be
used. Note that <CODE>tee</CODE> will flush the results into the file after
each command, just before the command-line appears again waiting for the
next command.

</P>
<P>
Browsing, or searching the results in the interactive mode in Unix less,
more, or any other similar program, is now possible with option
<CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>. Without argument, <CODE>mysql</CODE> client will look
for environment variable PAGER and set <CODE>pager</CODE> to that.
<CODE>pager</CODE> can be started from the interactive command-line with
command <CODE>pager</CODE> and disabled with command <CODE>nopager</CODE>.  The
command takes an argument optionally and the <CODE>pager</CODE> will be set to
that. Command <CODE>pager</CODE> can be called without an argument, but this
requires that the option <CODE>--pager</CODE> was used, or the <CODE>pager</CODE>
will default to stdout. <CODE>pager</CODE> works only in Unix, since it uses
the popen() function, which doesn't exist in Windows. In Windows, the
<CODE>tee</CODE> option can be used instead, although it may not be as handy
as <CODE>pager</CODE> can be in some situations.

</P>
<P>
A few tips about <CODE>pager</CODE>:

<UL>
<LI>

You can use it to write to a file:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat &#62; /tmp/log.txt
</PRE>

and the results will only go to a file. You can also pass any options
for the programs that you want to use with the <CODE>pager</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager less -n -i -S
</PRE>

<LI>

From the above do note the option '-S'. You may find it very useful when
browsing the results; try the option with horizontal output (end
commands with '\g', or ';') and with vertical output (end commands with
'\G'). Sometimes a very wide result set is hard to be read from the screen,
with option -S to less you can browse the results within the interactive
less from left to right, preventing lines longer than your screen from
being continued to the next line. This can make the result set much more
readable. You can swith the mode between on and off within the interactive
less with '-S'. See the 'h' for more help about less.

<LI>

You can combine very complex ways to handle the results, for example the
following would send the results to two files in two different
directories, on two different hard-disks mounted on /dr1 and /dr2, yet
let the results still be seen on the screen via less:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt | \
tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
You can also combine the two functions above; have the <CODE>tee</CODE>
enabled, <CODE>pager</CODE> set to 'less' and you will be able to browse the
results in unix 'less' and still have everything appended into a file
the same time. The difference between Unix <CODE>tee</CODE> used with the
<CODE>pager</CODE> and the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client in-built <CODE>tee</CODE>, is that
the in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> works even if you don't have the Unix <CODE>tee</CODE>
available. The in-built <CODE>tee</CODE> also logs everything that is printed
on the screen, where the Unix <CODE>tee</CODE> used with <CODE>pager</CODE> doesn't
log quite that much. Last, but not least, the interactive <CODE>tee</CODE> is
more handy to switch on and off, when you want to log something into a
file, but want to be able to turn the feature off sometimes.

<H3><A NAME="Using_mysqlcheck" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_mysqlcheck">4.8.4  Using <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> for Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery</A></H3>

<P>
Since MySQL version 3.23.38 you will be able to use a new
checking and repairing tool for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables. The difference to
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is that <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> should be used when the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is running, where as <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> should be used
when it is not. The benefit is that you no longer have to take the
server down for checking or repairing your tables.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> uses MySQL server commands <CODE>CHECK</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> and <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> in a convenient way
for the user.

</P>
<P>
There are three alternative ways to invoke <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] database [tables]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --databases DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
shell&#62; mysqlcheck [OPTIONS] --all-databases
</PRE>

<P>
So it can be used in a similar way as <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> when it
comes to what databases and tables you want to choose.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> does have a special feature compared to the other
clients; the default behaviour, checking tables (-c), can be changed by
renaming the binary. So if you want to have a tool that repairs tables
by default, you should just copy <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> to your harddrive
with a new name, <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>, or alternatively make a symbolic
link to <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> and name the symbolic link as
<CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE>. If you invoke <CODE>mysqlrepair</CODE> now, it will repair
tables by default.

</P>
<P>
The names that you can use to change <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> default behaviour
are here:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqlrepair:   The default option will be -r
mysqlanalyze:  The default option will be -a
mysqloptimize: The default option will be -o
</PRE>

<P>
The options available for <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> are listed here, please
check what your version supports with <CODE>mysqlcheck --help</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-A, --all-databases</CODE>
<DD>
Check all the databases. This will be same as --databases with all
databases selected
<DT><CODE>-1, --all-in-1</CODE>
<DD>
Instead of making one query for each table, execute all queries in 1
query separately for each database. Table names will be in a comma
separated list.
<DT><CODE>-a, --analyze</CODE>
<DD>
Analyse given tables.
<DT><CODE>--auto-repair</CODE>
<DD>
If a checked table is corrupted, automatically fix it. Repairing will be
done after all tables have been checked, if corrupted ones were found.
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug=...</CODE>
<DD>
Output debug log. Often this is 'd:t:o,filename'
<DT><CODE>--character-sets-dir=...</CODE>
<DD>
Directory where character sets are
<DT><CODE>-c, --check</CODE>
<DD>
Check table for errors
<DT><CODE>-C, --check-only-changed</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that have changed since last check or haven't been
closed properly.
<DT><CODE>--compress</CODE>
<DD>
Use compression in server/client protocol.
<DT><CODE>-?, --help</CODE>
<DD>
Display this help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To check several databases. Note the difference in usage; in this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<DT><CODE>--default-character-set=...</CODE>
<DD>
Set the default character set
<DT><CODE>-F, --fast</CODE>
<DD>
Check only tables that hasn't been closed properly
<DT><CODE>-f, --force</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get an sql-error.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it will ensure that the
table is 100 percent consistent, but will take a long time.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will run an extended
repair on the table, which may not only take a long time to execute, but
may produce a lot of garbage rows also!
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=...</CODE>
<DD>
Connect to host.
<DT><CODE>-m, --medium-check</CODE>
<DD>
Faster than extended-check, but only finds 99.99 percent of all
errors. Should be good enough for most cases.
<DT><CODE>-o, --optimize</CODE>
<DD>
Optimise table
<DT><CODE>-p, --password[=...]</CODE>
<DD>
Password to use when connecting to server. If password is not given
it's solicited on the tty.
<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to use for TCP/IP connections.
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
If you are using this option with CHECK TABLE, it prevents the check
from scanning the rows to check for wrong links. This is the fastest
check.

If you are using this option with REPAIR TABLE, it will try to repair
only the index tree. This is the fastest repair method for a table.
<DT><CODE>-r, --repair</CODE>
<DD>
Can fix almost anything except unique keys that aren't unique.
<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Print only error messages.
<DT><CODE>-S, --socket=...</CODE>
<DD>
Socket file to use for connection.
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-u, --user=#</CODE>
<DD>
User for login if not current user.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Print info about the various stages.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Output version information and exit.

Utility to dump a database or a collection of database for backup or for
transferring the data to another SQL server (not necessarily a MySQL
server).  The dump will contain SQL statements to create the table
and/or populate the table.

</P>
<P>
If you are doing a backup on the server, you should consider using
the <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> instead. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqlhotcopy">4.8.6  <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>, Copying MySQL Databases and Tables</A>.

</P>

<PRE>

OR     mysqldump [OPTIONS] --databases [OPTIONS] DB1 [DB2 DB3...]
OR     mysqldump [OPTIONS] --all-databases [OPTIONS]
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't give any tables or use the <CODE>--databases</CODE> or
<CODE>--all-databases</CODE>, the whole database(s) will be dumped.

</P>
<P>
You can get a list of the options your version of <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> supports
by executing <CODE>mysqldump --help</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you run <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> without <CODE>--quick</CODE> or
<CODE>--opt</CODE>, <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will load the whole result set into
memory before dumping the result.  This will probably be a problem if
you are dumping a big database.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using a new copy of the <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> program
and you are going to do a dump that will be read into a very old MySQL
server, you should not use the <CODE>--opt</CODE> or <CODE>-e</CODE> options.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--add-locks</CODE>
<DD>
Add <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> before and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLE</CODE> after each table dump.
(To get faster inserts into MySQL.)
<DT><CODE>--add-drop-table</CODE>
<DD>
Add a <CODE>drop table</CODE> before each create statement.
<DT><CODE>-A, --all-databases</CODE>
<DD>
Dump all the databases. This will be same as <CODE>--databases</CODE> with all
databases selected.
<DT><CODE>-a, --all</CODE>
<DD>
Include all MySQL-specific create options.
<DT><CODE>--allow-keywords</CODE>
<DD>
Allow creation of column names that are keywords.  This works by
prefixing each column name with the table name.
<DT><CODE>-c, --complete-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use complete insert statements (with column names).
<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>
<DD>
Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.
<DT><CODE>-B, --databases</CODE>
<DD>
To dump several databases. Note the difference in usage. In this case
no tables are given. All name arguments are regarded as database names.
<CODE>USE db_name;</CODE> will be included in the output before each new database.
<DT><CODE>--delayed</CODE>
<DD>
Insert rows with the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> command.
<DT><CODE>-e, --extended-insert</CODE>
<DD>
Use the new multiline <CODE>INSERT</CODE> syntax. (Gives more compact and
faster inserts statements.)
<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.
<DT><CODE>--fields-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-escaped-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--lines-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
These options are used with the <CODE>-T</CODE> option and have the same
meaning as the corresponding clauses for <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<DT><CODE>-F, --flush-logs</CODE>
<DD>
Flush log file in the MySQL server before starting the dump.
<DT><CODE>-f, --force,</CODE>
<DD>
Continue even if we get a SQL error during a table dump.
<DT><CODE>-h, --host=..</CODE>
<DD>
Dump data from the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables.</CODE>
<DD>
Lock all tables before starting the dump.  The tables are locked with
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> to allow concurrent inserts in the case of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.

Please note that when dumping multiple databases, <CODE>--lock-tables</CODE>
will lock tables for each database separately. So using this option will
not guarantee your tables will be logically consistent between databases.
Tables in different databases may be dumped in completely different
states.
<DT><CODE>-K, --disable-keys</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tb_name DISABLE KEYS */;</CODE> and
<CODE>/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tb_name ENABLE KEYS */;</CODE>
will be put in the output.  This will make loading the data into a MySQL
4.0 server faster as the indexes are created after all data are inserted.
<DT><CODE>-n, --no-create-db</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>CREATE DATABASE /*!32312 IF NOT EXISTS*/ db_name;</CODE> will not be put in the
output. The above line will be added otherwise, if a <CODE>--databases</CODE> or
<CODE>--all-databases</CODE> option was given.
<DT><CODE>-t, --no-create-info</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write table creation information (the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement).
<DT><CODE>-d, --no-data</CODE>
<DD>
Don't write any row information for the table.  This is very useful if you
just want to get a dump of the structure for a table!
<DT><CODE>--opt</CODE>
<DD>
Same as <CODE>--quick --add-drop-table --add-locks --extended-insert
--lock-tables</CODE>.  Should give you the fastest possible dump for reading
into a MySQL server.
<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.
<DT><CODE>-P, --port=...</CODE>
<DD>
Port number to use for TCP/IP connections.
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.
<DT><CODE>-q, --quick</CODE>
<DD>
Don't buffer query, dump directly to stdout. Uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to do this.
<DT><CODE>-Q, --quote-names</CODE>
<DD>
Quote table and column names within <SAMP>``'</SAMP> characters.
<DT><CODE>-r, --result-file=...</CODE>
<DD>
Direct output to a given file. This option should be used in MSDOS,
because it prevents new line <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP> from being converted to <SAMP>`\n\r'</SAMP>
(new line + carriage return).
<DT><CODE>--single-transaction</CODE>
<DD>
This option issues a <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> SQL command before dumping data from
server. It is mostly useful with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables and
<CODE>READ_COMMITTED</CODE> transaction isolation level, as in this mode it
will dump the consistent state of the database at the time then
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> was issued without blocking any applications.

When using this option you should keep in mind that only transactional
tables will be dumped in a consistent state, e.g., any <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables dumped while using this option may still change
state.

The <CODE>--single-transaction</CODE> option was added in version 4.0.2.
This option is mutually exclusive with the <CODE>--lock-tables</CODE> option
as <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> already commits a previous transaction internally.
<DT><CODE>-S /path/to/socket, --socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
The socket file to use when connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the
default host).
<DT><CODE>--tables</CODE>
<DD>
Overrides option --databases (-B).
<DT><CODE>-T, --tab=path-to-some-directory</CODE>
<DD>
Creates a <CODE>table_name.sql</CODE> file, that contains the SQL CREATE commands,
and a <CODE>table_name.txt</CODE> file, that contains the data, for each give table.
The format of the <TT>`.txt'</TT> file is made according to the
<CODE>--fields-xxx</CODE> and <CODE>--lines--xxx</CODE> options.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This option only works if <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is run on the same
machine as the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon, and the user/group that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
is running as (normally user <CODE>mysql</CODE>, group <CODE>mysql</CODE>) needs to have
permission to create/write a file at the location you specify.
<DT><CODE>-u user_name, --user=user_name</CODE>
<DD>
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The
default value is your Unix login name.
<DT><CODE>-O var=option, --set-variable var=option</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value of a variable.  The possible variables are listed below.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE>
is deprecated since MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--var=option</CODE> on its own.
<DT><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE>
<DD>
Verbose mode.  Print out more information on what the program does.
<DT><CODE>-V, --version</CODE>
<DD>
Print version information and exit.
<DT><CODE>-w, --where='where-condition'</CODE>
<DD>
Dump only selected records. Note that quotes are mandatory:
<DT><CODE>-X, --xml</CODE>
<DD>
Dumps a database as well formed XML
<DT><CODE>-x, --first-slave</CODE>
<DD>
Locks all tables across all databases.

When creating multi-row-insert statements (as with option
<CODE>--extended-insert</CODE> or <CODE>--opt</CODE>), <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> will create
rows up to <CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> length. If you increase this

variable in the MySQL server is bigger than the
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>.

The most normal use of <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> is probably for making a backup of
whole databases. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database &#62; backup-file.sql

You can read this back into MySQL with:

</P>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
mysql -e "source /patch-to-backup/backup-file.sql" database

However, it's also very useful to populate another MySQL server with
information from a database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqldump --opt database | mysql --host=remote-host -C database

See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> is invoked like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlimport [options] database textfile1 [textfile2 ...]
</PRE>

<P>
For each text file named on the command-line,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> strips any extension from the filename and uses the result
to determine which table to import the file's contents into.  For example,
files named <TT>`patient.txt'</TT>, <TT>`patient.text'</TT>, and <TT>`patient'</TT> would
all be imported into a table named <CODE>patient</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> supports the following options:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-c, --columns=...</CODE>
<DD>
This option takes a comma-separated list of field names as an argument.
The field list is used to create a proper <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command,
which is then passed to MySQL. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<DT><CODE>-C, --compress</CODE>
<DD>
Compress all information between the client and the server if both support
compression.

<DT><CODE>-#, --debug[=option_string]</CODE>
<DD>
Trace usage of the program (for debugging).

<DT><CODE>-d, --delete</CODE>
<DD>
Empty the table before importing the text file.

<DT><CODE>--fields-terminated-by=...</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--fields-enclosed-by=...</CODE>
<DD>

Ignore errors.  For example, if a table for a text file doesn't exist,
continue processing any remaining files.  Without <CODE>--force</CODE>,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> exits if a table doesn't exist.

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Display a help message and exit.

<DD>
Import data to the MySQL server on the named host. The default host
is <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-i, --ignore</CODE>
<DD>
See the description for the <CODE>--replace</CODE> option.

<DT><CODE>-l, --lock-tables</CODE>
<DD>
Lock <STRONG>all</STRONG> tables for writing before processing any text files. This
ensures that all tables are synchronised on the server.

<DT><CODE>-L, --local</CODE>
<DD>
Read input files from the client.  By default, text files are assumed to be on
the server if you connect to <CODE>localhost</CODE> (which is the default host).

<DT><CODE>-pyour_pass, --password[=your_pass]</CODE>
<DD>
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you specify
no <SAMP>`=your_pass'</SAMP> part,
<CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> you will be prompted for a password.

<DT><CODE>-P port_num, --port=port_num</CODE>
<DD>
TCP/IP port number to use for connection.

<A NAME="IDX791"></A>
<DT><CODE><CODE>--protocol=(TCP | SOCKET | PIPE | MEMORY)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
To specify the connect protocol to use.  New in MySQL 4.1.

<DT><CODE>-r, --replace</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>--replace</CODE> and <CODE>--ignore</CODE> options control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
<CODE>--replace</CODE>, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify <CODE>--ignore</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text
file is ignored.

<DT><CODE>-s, --silent</CODE>
<DD>
Silent mode.  Write output only when errors occur.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>The slow log </TD><TD> Stores all queries that took more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> to execute or didn't use indexes.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
All logs can be found in the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.  You can
force <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to reopen the log files (or in some cases
switch to a new log) by executing <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Error_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A></H3>

<P>
The error log file contains information indicating when <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
was started and stopped and also any critical errors found when running.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly and <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> needs to
restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> will write a <CODE>restarted
mysqld</CODE> row in this file.  This log also holds a warning if
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> notices a table that needs to be automatically checked or
repaired.

</P>
<P>
On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace
for where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. This can be used to find out where
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_stack_trace">E.1.4  Using a Stack Trace</A>.

</P>
<P>
Beginning with MySQL 4.0.10 you can specify where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> stores the
error log file with the option <CODE>--log-error[=filename]</CODE>. If no file
name is given <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will use <CODE>mysql-data-dir/'hostname'.err</CODE> on
Unix and <TT>`\mysql\data\mysql.err'</TT> on windows.
If you execute <CODE>flush logs</CODE> the old file will be prefixed with
<CODE>--old</CODE> and <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will create a new empty log file.

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions the error log handling was done by
<CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> which redirected the error file to
<CODE>'hostname'.err</CODE>.  One could change this file name with the option
<CODE>--err-log=filename</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify <CODE>--log-error</CODE> or if you use the <CODE>--console</CODE>
option the errors will be written to stderr (the terminal).

</P>
<P>
On windows the output is always done to the <CODE>.err</CODE> file if
<CODE>--console</CODE> is not given.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Query_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX802"></A>
<A NAME="IDX803"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you want to know what happens within <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should start
it with <CODE>--log[=file]</CODE>.  This will log all connections and queries
to the log file (by default named <TT>`'hostname'.log'</TT>).  This log can
be very useful when you suspect an error in a client and want to know
exactly what <CODE>mysqld</CODE> thought the client sent to it.

</P>
<P>
Older versions of the <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> script (from MySQL 3.23.4 to 3.23.8)
pass <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> a <CODE>--log</CODE> option (enable general query log).
If you need better performance when you start using MySQL in a production
environment, you can remove the <CODE>--log</CODE> option from <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>
or change it to <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
The entries in this log are written as <CODE>mysqld</CODE> receives the questions.
This may be different from the order in which the statements are executed.
This is in contrast to the update log and the binary log which are written
after the query is executed, but before any locks are released.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Update_log" HREF="manual_toc.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX804"></A>
<A NAME="IDX805"></A>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: the update log is replaced by the binary
log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.  With this you can do anything that you can do
with the update log.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-update[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update
data. If no filename is given, it defaults to the name of the host
machine. If a filename is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the file
is written in the data directory. If <TT>`file_name'</TT> doesn't have an
extension, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will create log file names like so:
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>, where <CODE>###</CODE> is a number that is incremented each
time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> statement, or restart the server.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: for the above scheme to work, you must not create
your own files with the same filename as the update log + some extensions
that may be regarded as a number, in the directory used by the update log!

</P>
<P>
If you use the <CODE>--log</CODE> or <CODE>-l</CODE> options, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a
general log with a filename of <TT>`hostname.log'</TT>, and restarts and
refreshes do not cause a new log file to be generated (although it is closed
and reopened). In this case you can copy it (on Unix) by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
mv hostname.log hostname-old.log
mysqladmin flush-logs
cp hostname-old.log to-backup-directory
rm hostname-old.log
</PRE>

<P>
Update logging is smart because it logs only statements that really update
data. So an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> that finds no
rows is not written to the log. It even skips <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that
set a column to the value it already has.

</P>
<P>
The update logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
If you want to update a database from update log files, you could do the
following (assuming your update logs have names of the form
<TT>`file_name.###'</TT>):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ls -1 -t -r file_name.[0-9]* | xargs cat | mysql
</PRE>

<CODE>ls</CODE> is used to get all the log files in the right order.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX806"></A>
<A NAME="IDX807"></A>

</P>
<P>
The intention is that the binary log should replace the update log, so
we recommend you to switch to this log format as soon as possible!

</P>
<P>
The binary log contains all information that is available in the update
log in a more efficient format. It also contains information about how long
each query took that updated the database.  It doesn't contain queries that
don't modify any data.  If you want to log all queries (for example to
find a problem query) you should use the general query log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
The binary log is also used when you are replicating a slave from a master.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-bin[=file_name]</CODE> option, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
writes a log file containing all SQL commands that update data. If no
file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine followed
by <CODE>-bin</CODE>. If file name is given, but it doesn't contain a path, the
file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
If you supply an extension to <CODE>--log-bin=filename.extension</CODE>, the
extension will be silenty removed.

</P>
<P>
To the binary log filename <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will append an extension that
is a number that is incremented each time you execute <CODE>mysqladmin
refresh</CODE>, execute <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE>, execute the <CODE>FLUSH
LOGS</CODE> statement or restart the server. A new binary log will also
automatically be created when it reaches <CODE>max_binlog_size</CODE>. You can
delete all not active binary log files with the <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>
command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#RESET">4.5.4  <CODE>RESET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can use the following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to affect what is logged
to the binary log:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that it should log updates to the binary log if the
current database
(i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
database is 'database_name'. All others
databases which are not explicitly mentioned are ignored.
Note that if you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in
the current database.
(Example: <CODE>binlog-do-db=some_database</CODE>)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that updates where the current database
(i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>) is
'database_name' should not be stored in the binary log.  Note that if
you use this you should ensure that you only do updates in the current
database.
(Example: <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=some_database</CODE>)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
To be able to know which different binary log files have been used,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will also create a binary log index file that
contains the name of all used binary log files. By default this has the
same name as the binary log file, with the extension <CODE>'.index'</CODE>.
You can change the name of the binary log index file with the
<CODE>--log-bin-index=[filename]</CODE> option.
You should not manually edit this file while <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is running;
doing this would confuse <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using replication, you should not delete old binary log
files until you are sure that no slave will ever need to use them.
One way to do this is to do <CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> once a day and then
remove any logs that are more than 3 days old. You can remove them
manually, or preferably using <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_SQL">4.10.6  SQL Commands Related to Replication</A>) which will also safely update the binary 
log index file for you.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX808"></A>
You can examine the binary log file with the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> command.
For example, you can update a MySQL server from the binary log
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqlbinlog log-file | mysql -h server_name
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use the <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> program to read the binary log
directly from a remote MySQL server!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqlbinlog --help</CODE> will give you more information of how to use
this program!

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>BEGIN [WORK]</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you must
use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the old update log.

</P>
<P>
The binary logging is done immediately after a query completes but before
any locks are released or any commit is done. This ensures that the log
will be logged in the execution order.

</P>
<P>
Updates to non-transactional tables are stored in the binary log
immediately after execution.  For transactional tables such as <CODE>BDB</CODE>
or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, all updates (<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
or <CODE>INSERT</CODE>) that change tables are cached until a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>
command is sent to the server. At this point <CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes the whole
transaction to the binary log before the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> is executed.
Every thread will, on start, allocate a buffer of <CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE>
to buffer queries.  If a query is bigger than this, the thread will open
a temporary file to store the transaction.  The temporary file will
be deleted when the thread ends.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE> (default 4G) can be used to restrict the
total size used to cache a multi-query transaction.  If a transaction is
bigger than this it will fail and roll back.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the update or binary log, concurrent inserts will
be converted to normal inserts when using <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> or
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE>.
This is to ensure that you can recreate an exact copy of your tables by
applying the log on a backup.

<A NAME="IDX810"></A>

</P>
<P>
When started with the <CODE>--log-slow-queries[=file_name]</CODE> option,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> writes a log file containing all SQL commands that took
more than <CODE>long_query_time</CODE> to execute. The time to get the initial
table locks are not counted as execution time.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log is logged after the query is executed and after all
locks has been released. This may be different from the order in which
the statements are executed.

</P>
<P>
If no file name is given, it defaults to the name of the host machine
suffixed with <CODE>-slow.log</CODE>. If a filename is given, but doesn't
contain a path, the file is written in the data directory.

</P>
<P>
The slow query log can be used to find queries that take a long time to
execute and are thus candidates for optimisation. With a large log, that
can become a difficult task. You can pipe the slow query log through the
<CODE>mysqldumpslow</CODE> command to get a summary of the queries which
appear in the log.

</P>
<P>
You are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that are not
using indexes are printed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

<A NAME="IDX813"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL Server can create a number of different log files, which make
it easy to see what is going on. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Log_Files">4.9  The MySQL Log Files</A>. One must however
regularly clean up these files, to ensure that the logs don't take up
too much disk space.

</P>
<P>
When using MySQL with log files, you will, from time to time,
want to remove/backup old log files and tell MySQL to start
logging on new files.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>
<P>
On a Linux (<CODE>Red Hat</CODE>) installation, you can use the
<CODE>mysql-log-rotate</CODE> script for this. If you installed MySQL
from an RPM distribution, the script should have been installed
automatically.  Note that you should be careful with this if you are using
the log for replication!

</P>
<P>
On other systems you must install a short script yourself that you
start from <CODE>cron</CODE> to handle log files.

</P>
<P>
You can force MySQL to start using new log files by using
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-logs</CODE> or by using the SQL command <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE>.
If you are using MySQL Version 3.21 you must use <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The above command does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If standard logging (<CODE>--log</CODE>) or slow query logging
(<CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>) is used, closes and reopens the log file
(<TT>`mysql.log'</TT> and <TT>``hostname`-slow.log'</TT> as default).
<LI>

If update logging (<CODE>--log-update</CODE>) is used, closes the update log and
opens a new log file with a higher sequence number.
</UL>

<P>
If you are using only an update log, you only have to flush the logs and then
move away the old update log files to a backup.
If you are using the normal logging, you can do something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd mysql-data-directory
shell&#62; mv mysql.log mysql.old
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-logs
</PRE>

<P>

This section describes the various replication features in MySQL.
It serves as a reference to the options available with replication.
You will be introduced to replication and learn how to implement it.
Toward the end, there are some frequently asked questions and descriptions
of problems and how to solve them.

</P>
<P>
We suggest that you visit our website at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
often and read updates to this section. Replication is constantly being
improved, and we update the manual frequently with the most current
information.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Replication_Intro" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Intro">4.10.1  Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
One way replication can be used is to increase both robustness and
speed. For robustness you can have two systems and can switch to the backup if
you have problems with the master. The extra speed is achieved by
sending a part of the non-updating queries to the replica server. Of
course this only works if non-updating queries dominate, but that is the
normal case.

</P>
<P>
Starting in Version 3.23.15, MySQL supports one-way replication
internally. One server acts as the master, while the other acts as the
slave. Note that one server could play the roles of master in one pair
and slave in the other. The master server keeps a binary log of updates
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>) and an index file to binary logs to keep track of
log rotation.  The slave, upon connecting, informs the master where it
left off since the last successfully propagated update, catches up on
the updates, and then blocks and waits for the master to notify it of
the new updates.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are replicating a database, all updates to this
database should be done through the master!

</P>
<P>
Another benefit of using replication is that one can get live backups of
the system by doing a backup on a slave instead of doing it on the
master. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Replication_Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Implementation">4.10.2  Replication Implementation Overview</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX818"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL replication is based on the server keeping track of all
changes to your database (updates, deletes, etc) in the binary
log (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>) and the slave server(s) reading the saved
queries from the master server's binary log so that the slave can
execute the same queries on its copy of the data.

</P>
<P>
It is <STRONG>very important</STRONG> to realise that the binary log is simply a
record starting from a fixed point in time (the moment you enable binary
logging). Any slaves which you set up will need copies of all the data
from your master as it existed the moment that you enabled binary
logging on the master. If you start your slaves with data that doesn't
agree with what was on the master <STRONG>when the binary log was
started</STRONG>, your slaves may fail.

</P>
<P>
Please see the following table for an indication of master-slave
compatibility between different versions. With regard to version 4.0,
we recommend using same version on both sides.

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: MySQL Version 4.0.2 is not recommended for replication.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 4.0.0, one can use <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> to set up
a slave. Be aware that <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> currently works only
if all the tables on the master are <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> type, and will acquire a
global read lock, so no writes are possible while the tables are being
transferred from the master. This limitation is of a temporary nature, and is
due to the fact that we have not yet implemented hot lock-free table backup.
It will be removed in the future 4.0 branch versions once we implement hot
backup enabling <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> to work without blocking master
updates.

</P>
<P>
Due to the above limitation, we recommend that at this point  you use
<CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> only if the dataset on the master is relatively
small, or if a prolonged read lock on the master is acceptable. While the
actual speed of <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> may vary from system to system,
a good rule for a rough estimate of how long it is going to take is 1 second
per 1 MB of the datafile. You will get close to the estimate if both master
and slave are equivalent to 700 MHz Pentium, are connected through
100 MBit/s network, and your index file is about half the size of your data
file. Of course, your mileage will vary from system to system, the above rule
just gives you a rough order of magnitude estimate.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is properly configured and running, it will simply connect
to the master and wait for updates to process. If the master goes away
or the slave loses connectivity with your master, it will keep trying to
connect every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> seconds until it is able to
reconnect and resume listening for updates.

</P>
<P>
Each slave keeps track of where it left off. The master server has no
knowledge of how many slaves there are or which ones are up-to-date at
any given time.

</P>
<P>
The next section explains the master/slave setup process in more detail.

<H3><A NAME="Replication_HOWTO" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_HOWTO">4.10.3  How To Set Up Replication</A></H3>

<P>
Here is a quick description of how to set up complete replication on
your current MySQL server. It assumes you want to replicate all
your databases and have not configured replication before. You will need
to shutdown your master server briefly to complete the steps outlined
here.

</P>
<P>
While this method is the most straightforward way to set up a slave,
it is not the only one. For example, if you already have a snapshot
of the master, and
the master already has server id set and binary logging enabled, you can
set up a slave without shutting the master down or even blocking the updates.
For more details, please see section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.7  Replication FAQ</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you want to become a real MySQL replication guru, we suggest that you
begin by studying, pondering, and trying all commands
mentioned in section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_SQL">4.10.6  SQL Commands Related to Replication</A>. You should also familiarise yourself
with replication startup options in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> in
section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication_Options">4.10.5  Replication Options in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT></A>.

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Make sure you have a recent version of MySQL installed on the master
and slave(s).

Use Version 3.23.29 or higher. Previous releases used a different binary
log format and had bugs which have been fixed in newer releases. Please,
do not report bugs until you have verified that the problem is present
in the latest release.

<LI>

Set up special a replication user on the master with the <CODE>FILE</CODE>
(in MySQL versions older than 4.0.2) or <CODE>REPLICATION SLAVE</CODE>
privilege in newer MySQL versions.  You must also have given permission
to connect from all the slaves. If the user is only doing replication
(which is recommended), you don't need to grant any additional privileges.

For example, to create a user named <CODE>repl</CODE> which can access your
master from any host, you might use this command:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT FILE ON *.* TO repl@"%" IDENTIFIED BY '&#60;password&#62;'; # master &#60; 4.0.2
</PRE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO repl@"%" IDENTIFIED BY '&#60;password&#62;'; # master &#62;= 4.0.2
</PRE>

If you plan to use the <CODE>LOAD TABLE FROM MASTER</CODE> or
<CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> commands (available
starting from version 4.0.0), you will also need to grant the
<CODE>RELOAD</CODE> and <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privileges on the master to the above user.

<LI>

If you are using MyISAM tables, flush all the tables and block write queries
by executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> command.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
</PRE>

and then take a snapshot of the data on your master server.

The easiest way to do this (on Unix) is to simply use <STRONG>tar</STRONG> to
produce an archive of your entire data directory. The exact data
directory location depends on your installation.


<PRE>
tar -cvf /tmp/mysql-snapshot.tar /path/to/data-dir
</PRE>

Windows users can use <CODE>WinZIP</CODE> or similar software to create an
archive of the data directory.

After or during the process of taking a snapshot, read the value of the
current binary log name and the offset on the master:


<PRE>
mysql &#62; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
+---------------+----------+--------------+-------------------------------+
| File          | Position | Binlog_do_db | Binlog_ignore_db              |
+---------------+----------+--------------+-------------------------------+
| mysql-bin.003 | 73       | test,bar     | foo,manual,sasha_likes_to_run |
+---------------+----------+--------------+-------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
</PRE>

The <CODE>File</CODE> column shows the name of the log,  while <CODE>Position</CODE> shows
the offset. In the above example, the binary log value is
<CODE>mysql-bin.003</CODE> and the offset is 73. Record the values - you will need
to use them later when you are setting up the slave.

Once you have taken the snapshot and recorded the log name and offset, you can
re-enable write activity on the master:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

If you are using InnoDB tables, ideally you should use the InnoDB Hot Backup
tool that is available to those who purchase MySQL commercial licenses,
support, or the backup tool itself. It will take a consistent snapshot
without acquiring any locks on the master server, and record the log name and
offset corresponding to the snapshot to be later used on the slave. More
information about the tool is avaliable at
<a HREF="http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html">http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html</a>.

Without the hot backup tool, the quickest way to take a snapshot of  InnoDB
tables is to shut the master server down and copy the data files, the logs,
and the table definition files (<CODE>.frm</CODE>). To record the current log file
name and offset, you should do the following before you shut down the server:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
mysql&#62; SHOW MASTER STATUS;
</PRE>

And then record the log name and the offset from the output of
<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> as was shown earlier. Once you have recorded the
log name and the offset, shut the server down without unlocking the tables to
make sure it goes down with the snapshot corresponding to the current log file
and offset:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -uroot shutdown
</PRE>

If the master has been previously running without <CODE>log-bin</CODE> enabled,
the values of log name and position will be empty when you run
<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE>. In that case, record empty string ('') for the
log name, and 4 for the offset.

<LI>

Make sure that <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> on the master has  <CODE>log-bin</CODE> if it is not there already
and <CODE>server-id=unique number</CODE> in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section. If those
options are not present, add them and restart the server.
It is very important that the id of the slave is different from
the id of the master. Think of <CODE>server-id</CODE> as something similar
to the IP address - it uniquely identifies the server instance in the
community of replication partners.


<PRE>
[mysqld]
log-bin
server-id=1
</PRE>

<LI>

Add the following to <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> on the slave(s):


<PRE>
server-id=&#60;some unique number between 1 and 2^32-1 that is different from
 that of the master&#62;
</PRE>

replacing the values in &#60;&#62; with what is relevant to your system.

<CODE>server-id</CODE> must be different for each server participating in
replication.  If you don't specify a server-id, it will be set to 1 if
you have not defined <CODE>master-host</CODE>, else it will be set to 2. Note
that in the case of <CODE>server-id</CODE> omission the master will refuse
connections from all slaves, and the slave will refuse to connect to a
master. Thus, omitting <CODE>server-id</CODE> is only good for backup with a
binary log.

<LI>

While the slave is running, make it forget about the old replication
configuration if it has been replicating previously:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; RESET SLAVE;
</PRE>

<LI>

Copy the snapshot data into your data directory on your slave(s). Make
sure that the privileges on the files and directories are correct. The
user which MySQL runs as needs to be able to read and write to
them, just as on the master.

<LI>Restart the slave(s).

<LI>

Once the slave comes up, execute the following command:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='&#60;master host name&#62;',
 MASTER_USER='&#60;replication user name&#62;',
 MASTER_PASSWORD='&#60;replication password&#62;',
 MASTER_LOG_FILE='&#60;recorded log file name&#62;',
 MASTER_LOG_POS=&#60;recorded log offset&#62;;
</PRE>

replacing the values in &#60;&#62; with the actual values relevant to your system.

<LI>

Start the slave thread:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SLAVE START;
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
After you have done the above, the slave(s) should connect to the master
and catch up on any updates which happened since the snapshot was taken.

</P>
<P>
If you have forgotten to set <CODE>server-id</CODE> for the slave you will get
the following error in the error log file:

</P>

<PRE>
Warning: one should set server_id to a non-0 value if master_host is set.
The server will not act as a slave.
</PRE>

<P>
If you have forgotten to do this for the master, the slaves will not be
able to connect to the master.

</P>
<P>
If a slave is not able to replicate for any reason, you will find error
messages in the error log on the slave.

</P>
<P>
Once a slave is replicating, you will find a file called
<TT>`master.info'</TT> in the same directory as your error log. The
<TT>`master.info'</TT> file is used by the slave to keep track of how much
of the master's binary log it has processed. <STRONG>Do not</STRONG> remove or
edit the file, unless you really know what you are doing. Even in that case,
it is preferred that you use <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
Now that you have a snapshot, you can use it to set up other slaves. To do so,
follow the slave portion of the procedure described above. You do not need to
take another snapshot of the master.

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> in updates does not replicate properly. Use
<CODE>RAND(some_non_rand_expr)</CODE> if you are replicating updates with
<CODE>RAND()</CODE>. You can, for example, use <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> for the
argument to <CODE>RAND()</CODE>.
<LI>

You have to use the same character set (<CODE>--default-character-set</CODE>)
on the master and the slave. If not, you may get duplicate key errors on
the slave, because a key that is regarded as unique in the master character
set may not be unique in the slave character set.
<LI>

In 3.23, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> will be handled properly as long as the file
still resides on the master server at the time of update
propagation. <CODE>LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE</CODE> will be skipped. In 4.0, this
limitation is not present - all forms of <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> are properly
replicated.
<LI>

Update queries that use user variables are not replication-safe (yet).
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH</CODE> commands are not stored in the binary log and are because
of this not replicated to the slaves. This is not normally a problem as
<CODE>FLUSH</CODE> doesn't change anything. This does however mean that if you
update the MySQL privilege tables directly without using the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> statement and you replicate the <CODE>mysql</CODE> privilege
database, you must do a <CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> on your slaves to put
the new privileges into effect.
<LI>

Temporary tables starting in 3.23.29 are replicated properly with the
exception of the case when you shut down slave server ( not just slave thread),
you have some temporary tables open, and they are used in subsequent updates.
To deal with this problem shutting down the slave, do <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE>,
check <CODE>Slave_open_temp_tables</CODE> variable to see if it is 0, then issue
<CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>. If the number is not 0, restart the slave thread
with <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> and see
if you have better luck next time. There will be a cleaner solution, but it
has to wait until version 4.0.
In earlier versions temporary tables are not replicated properly - we
recommend that you either upgrade, or execute <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE> on
your clients before all queries with temp tables.
<LI>

MySQL only supports one master and many slaves. In 4.x, we will
add a voting algorithm to automatically change master if something goes
wrong with the current master. We will also introduce 'agent' processes
to help do load balancing by sending select queries to different
slaves.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.26, it is safe to connect servers in a circular
master-slave relationship with <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> enabled.
Note, however, that many queries will not work right in this kind of
setup unless your client code is written to take care of the potential
problems that can happen from updates that occur in different sequence
on different servers.

This means that you can do a setup like the following:


<PRE>
A -&#62; B -&#62; C -&#62; A
</PRE>

This setup will only works if you only do non conflicting updates
between the tables.  In other words, if you insert data in A and C, you
should never insert a row in A that may have a conflicting key with a
row insert in C.  You should also not update the sam rows on two servers
if the order in which the updates are applied matters.

Note that the log format has changed in Version 3.23.26 so that
pre-3.23.26 slaves will not be able to read it.
<LI>

If the query on the slave gets an error, the slave thread will
terminate, and a message will appear in the <TT>`.err'</TT> file. You should
then connect to the slave manually, fix the cause of the error (for
example, non-existent table), and then run the <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> SQL
command (available starting in Version 3.23.16). In Version 3.23.15, you
will have to restart the server.
<LI>

If connection to the master is lost, the slave will retry immediately,
and then in case of failure every <CODE>master-connect-retry</CODE> (default
60) seconds. Because of this, it is safe to shut down the master, and
then restart it after a while. The slave will also be able to deal with
network connectivity outages. However, the slave will notice the
network outage only after receiving no data from the master for
<CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE> seconds. So if your outages are short, you may want
to decrease <CODE>slave_net_timeout</CODE> ; see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

<LI>

Shutting down the slave (cleanly) is also safe, as it keeps track of
where it left off.  Unclean shutdowns might produce problems, especially
if disk cache was not synced before the system died. Your system fault
tolerance will be greatly increased if you have a good UPS.
<LI>

If the master is listening on a non-standard port, you will also need to
specify this with <CODE>master-port</CODE> parameter in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> .
<LI>

In Version 3.23.15, all of the tables and databases will be
replicated. Starting in Version 3.23.16, you can restrict replication to
a set of databases with <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE> directives in
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or just exclude a set of databases with
<CODE>replicate-ignore-db</CODE>. Note that up until Version 3.23.23, there was a bug
that did not properly deal with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> if you did it in
a database that was excluded from replication.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.16, <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN = 0</CODE> will turn off
replication (binary) logging on the master, and <CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN =
1</CODE> will turn it back on -- you must have the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> (in MySQL
4.0.2 and above) or <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> (in older MySQL versions) privilege
to do this.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.19, you can clean up stale replication leftovers when
something goes wrong and you want a clean start with <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>
and <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> commands. In Version 3.23.26 we have renamed them to
<CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE> respectively to clarify
what they do. The old <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> variants still work, though, for
compatibility.

<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.23, you can change masters and adjust log position
with <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.23, you tell the master that updates in certain
databases should not be logged to the binary log with <CODE>binlog-ignore-db</CODE>.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.26, you can use <CODE>replicate-rewrite-db</CODE> to tell
the slave to apply updates from one database on the master to the one
with a different name on the slave.
<LI>

Starting in Version 3.23.28, you can use <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'log-name'</CODE>
to get rid of old logs while the slave is running. This will remove all old
logs before, but not including <CODE>'log-name'</CODE>.
<LI>

Due to the non-transactional nature of MyISAM tables, it is possible to have
a query that will only partially update a table and return an error code. This
can happen, for example, on a multi-row insert that has one row violating a
key constraint, or if a long update query is killed after updating some of the
rows. If that happens on the master, the slave thread will exit and wait for
the DBA to decide what to do about it unless the error code is legitimate and
the query execution results in the same error code. If this error code
validation behaviour is not desirable, some ( or all) errors could be masked
out with <CODE>slave-skip-errors</CODE> option starting in Version 3.23.47.
<LI>

While individual tables can be excluded from replication with
<CODE>replicate-do-table</CODE>/<CODE>replicate-ignore-table</CODE> or
<CODE>replicate-wild-do-table</CODE>/<CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table</CODE>, there
are currently some design deficiencies that in some rather rare cases
produce unexpected results. The replication protocol does not inform the
slave explicitly which tables are going to be modified by the query -- so
the slave has to parse the query to know this. To avoid redundant
parsing for queries that will end up actually being executed, table
exclusion is currently implemented by sending the query to the standard
MySQL parser, which will short-circuit the query and report success if
it detects that the table should be ignored. In addition to several
inefficiencies, this approach is also more bug prone, and there are two
known bugs as of Version 3.23.49 -- because the parser automatically opens
the table when parsing some queries the ignored table has to exist on
the slave. The other bug is that if the ignored table gets partially
updated, the slave thread will not notice that the table actually should
have been ignored and will suspend the replication process. While the
above bugs are conceptually very simple to fix, we have not yet found a way
to do this without a significant code change that would compromise the stability
status of 3.23 branch. There exists a workaround for both if in the rare case
it happens to affect your application -- use <CODE>slave-skip-errors</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Replication_Options" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Options">4.10.5  Replication Options in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT></A></H3>

<P>
If you are using replication, we recommend that you use MySQL Version
3.23.33 or later. Older versions work, but they do have some bugs and are
missing some features. Some of the options mentioned here may not be available in
your version if it is not the most recent one. For all options specific to
the 4.0 branch, there is a note indicating so. Otherwise, if you discover
that the option you are interested in is not available in your 3.23 version,
and you really need it, please upgrade to the most recent 3.23 branch.

</P>
<P>
Please be aware that 4.0 branch is still in alpha, so some things may not be
working as smoothly as you would like. If you really would like to try
the new features of 4.0, we recommend you do it in such a way that in
case there is a problem  your mission critical applications will not be
disrupted.

</P>
<P>
On both master and slave you need to use the <CODE>server-id</CODE> option.
This sets a unique replication id. You should pick a unique value in the
range between 1 to 2^32-1 for each master and slave.
Example: <CODE>server-id=3</CODE>

</P>
<P>
The following table describes the options you can use for the <CODE>MASTER</CODE>:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>log-bin=filename</CODE> </TD><TD>
Write to a binary update log to the specified location. Note that if you
give it a parameter with an extension (for example,
<CODE>log-bin=/mysql/logs/replication.log</CODE> ) versions up to 3.23.24 will
not work right during replication if you do <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> . The
problem is fixed in Version 3.23.25. If you are using this kind of log
name, <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> will be ignored on binlog. To clear the log, run
<CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>, and do not forget to run <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> on all
slaves. In Versions 3.23.26 and later, you should use
<CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>.
You can use this option if you want to have a name which is independant
of your hostname (could be useful in case you rename your host one day).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>log-bin-index=filename</CODE> </TD><TD>
Because the user could issue the <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> command, we need to
know which log is currently active and which ones have been rotated out
and in what sequence. This information is stored in the binary log index file.
The default is <TT>``hostname`.index'</TT>. You should not need to change this.

Example: <CODE>log-bin-index=db.index</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>sql-bin-update-same</CODE> </TD><TD>
If set, setting <CODE>SQL_LOG_BIN</CODE> to a value will automatically set
<CODE>SQL_LOG_UPDATE</CODE> to the same value and vice versa.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that it should log updates to the binary log if the
current database
(i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE>. All others
databases which are not explicitly mentioned are ignored.  Note that if
you use this, you should ensure that you do updates only in the current
database.

Example: <CODE>binlog-do-db=sales</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>binlog-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the master that updates where the current database
(i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE> should not be stored in the binary log.  Note that if
you use this, you should ensure that you do updates only in the current
database.

Example: <CODE>binlog-ignore-db=accounting</CODE>
</TD></TR>

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-host=host</CODE> </TD><TD>
Master hostname or IP address for replication. If not set, the slave
thread will not be started. Note that the setting of <CODE>master-host</CODE>
will be ignored if there exists a valid <TT>`master.info'</TT> file. Probably a
better name for this options would have been something like
<CODE>bootstrap-master-host</CODE>, but it is too late to change now.

Example: <CODE>master-host=db-master.mycompany.com</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-user=username</CODE> </TD><TD>
The username the slave thread will use for authentication when connecting to
the master. The user must have the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege. If the master user
is not set, user <CODE>test</CODE> is assumed. The value in <TT>`master.info'</TT> will
take precedence if it can be read.

Example: <CODE>master-user=scott</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-password=password</CODE> </TD><TD>
The password the slave thread will authenticate with when connecting to
the master. If not set, an empty password is assumed.The value in
<TT>`master.info'</TT> will take precedence if it can be read.

Example: <CODE>master-password=tiger</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-port=portnumber</CODE> </TD><TD>
The port the master is listening on. If not set, the compiled setting of
<CODE>MYSQL_PORT</CODE> is assumed. If you have not tinkered with
<CODE>configure</CODE> options, this should be 3306. The value in
<TT>`master.info'</TT> will take precedence if it can be read.

Example: <CODE>master-port=3306</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-connect-retry=seconds</CODE> </TD><TD>
The number of seconds the slave thread will sleep before retrying to
connect to the master in case the master goes down or the connection is
lost.  Default is 60.

Example: <CODE>master-connect-retry=60</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-ssl</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available after 4.0.0. Turn SSL on for replication. Be warned that is
this is a relatively new feature.

Example: <CODE>master-ssl</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-ssl-key</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available after 4.0.0. Master SSL keyfile name. Only applies if you have
enabled <CODE>master-ssl</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>master-ssl-key=SSL/master-key.pem</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-ssl-cert</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available after 4.0.0. Master SSL certificate file name. Only applies if
you have enabled <CODE>master-ssl</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>master-ssl-key=SSL/master-cert.pem</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>master-info-file=filename</CODE> </TD><TD>
The location of the file that remembers where we left off on the master
during the replication process. The default is <TT>`master.info'</TT> in the data
directory. You should not need to change this.

Example: <CODE>master-info-file=master.info</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>report-host</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available after 4.0.0. Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to
the master during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE HOSTS</CODE>. Leave unset if you do not want the slave to
register itself with the master. Note that it is not sufficient for the
master to simply read the IP of the slave off the socket once the slave
connects. Due to <CODE>NAT</CODE> and other routing issues, that IP may not be
valid for connecting to the slave from the master or other hosts.

Example: <CODE>report-host=slave1.mycompany.com</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>report-port</CODE> </TD><TD>
Available after 4.0.0. Port for connecting to slave reported to the
master during slave registration.  Set it only if the slave is listening
on a non-default port or if you have a special tunnel from the master or
other clients to the slave. If not sure, leave this option unset.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the specified table.
To specify more than one table, use the directive multiple times, once
for each table.  This will work for cross-database updates, in
contrast to <CODE>replicate-do-db</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-do-table=some_db.some_table</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate any command that updates the
specified table (even if any other tables may be update by the same
command). To specify more than one table to ignore, use the directive
multiple times, once for each table. This will work for cross-database
updates, in contrast to <CODE>replicate-ignore-db</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-ignore-table=db_name.some_table</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to queries where any of
the updated tables match the specified wildcard pattern.  To specify
more than one table, use the directive multiple times, once for each
table.  This will work for cross-database updates.

Example: <CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will replicate only
updates that uses a table in any databases that start with <CODE>foo</CODE>
and whose table names start with <CODE>bar</CODE>.

Note that if you do <CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.%</CODE> then the rule
will be propagated to <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>,
i.e.  these two statements will be replicated if the database name
matches the database pattern ('foo%' here) (this magic is triggered by
'%' being the table pattern).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.table_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave thread to not replicate a query where any table matches the
given wildcard pattern. To specify more than one table to ignore, use
the directive multiple times, once for each table. This will work for
cross-database updates.

Example: <CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%</CODE> will not do updates
to tables in databases that start with <CODE>foo</CODE> and whose table names start
with <CODE>bar</CODE>.

Note that if you do <CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.%</CODE> then the
rule will be propagated to <CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> and <CODE>DROP
DATABASE</CODE>, i.e.  these two statements will not be replicated if the
database name matches the database pattern ('foo%' here) (this magic is
triggered by '%' being the table pattern).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-ignore-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>

Tells the slave thread to not replicate any command where the current
database (i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE>. To specify more than one database to
ignore, use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
You should not use this directive if you are using cross table updates
and you don't want these update to be replicated.

The main reason for this ``just-check-the-current-database''
behaviour is that it's hard from the command
alone to know if a query should be replicated or not ; for example if you
are using multi-table-delete or multi-table-update commands in MySQL 4.x
that go across multiple databases.  It's also very fast to just check
the current database, as this only has to be done once at connect time
or when the database changes.

If you need cross database updates to work, make sure you have 3.23.28
or later, and use <CODE>replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-ignore-db=some_db</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-do-db=database_name</CODE> </TD><TD>

Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to commands where
the current database (i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
is <CODE>database_name</CODE>.
To specify more than one database, use the directive multiple
times, once for each database. Note that this will not replicate
cross-database queries such as <CODE>UPDATE some_db.some_table
SET foo='bar'</CODE> while having selected a different or no database. If you
need cross database updates to work, make sure you have 3.23.28 or
later, and use <CODE>replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%</CODE>.

Example: <CODE>replicate-do-db=some_db</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread to the
slave's binary log. Off by default.
Of course, it requires that the slave be started with binary
logging enabled (<CODE>log-bin</CODE> option).
You have to use <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> to
chain several slaves ; for example for the following setup to work


<PRE>
A -&#62; B -&#62;C
</PRE>

(C is a slave of B which is a slave of A) you need to
start B with the <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> option.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>replicate-rewrite-db=from_name-&#62;to_name</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave to translate the current database
(i.e. the one selected by <CODE>USE</CODE>)
to <CODE>to_name</CODE> if it was <CODE>from_name</CODE> on the master.
Only statements involving tables may be affected
(<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE>, <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> won't),
and only if <CODE>from_name</CODE> was the current database on the master.
This will not work for cross-database updates.

Example: <CODE>replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name-&#62;slave_db_name</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>slave-skip-errors= [err_code1,err_code2,... | all]</CODE> </TD><TD>

Available only in 3.23.47 and later. Tells the slave thread to continue
replication when a query returns an error from the provided
list. Normally, replication will discontinue when an error is
encountered, giving the user a chance to resolve the inconsistency in the
data manually. Do not use this option unless you fully understand why
you are getting the errors.  If there are no bugs in your
replication setup and client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, you
should never get an abort with error. Indiscriminate use of this option
will result in slaves being hopelessly out of sync with the master and
you having no idea how the problem happened.

For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the error message in
your slave error log and in the output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. Full list
of error messages can be found in the source distribution in
<TT>`Docs/mysqld_error.txt'</TT>.

You can (but should not) also use a very non-recommended value of <CODE>all</CODE>
which will ignore all error messages and keep barging along regardless.
Needless to say, if you use it, we make no promises regarding your data
integrity. Please do not complain if your data on the slave is not anywhere
close to what it is on the master in this case -- you have been warned.

Example:

<CODE>slave-skip-errors=1062,1053</CODE> or <CODE>slave-skip-errors=all</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>skip-slave-start</CODE> </TD><TD>
Tells the slave server not to start the slave on the startup.  The user
can start it later with <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>slave_compressed_protocol=#</CODE> </TD><TD>
If 1, then use compression on the slave/client protocol if both
slave and master support this.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>slave_net_timeout=#</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of seconds to wait for more data from the master before aborting
the read.

<TR><TD><STRONG>Command</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Starts the slave thread.
As of MySQL 4.0.2, you can add <CODE>IO_THREAD</CODE> or <CODE>SQL_THREAD</CODE>
options to the statement to start the I/O thread or the SQL thread.
The I/O thread reads queries from the master server and stores them in the
relay log.  The SQL thread reads the relay log and executes the queries.
(Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Stops the slave thread. Like <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>, this statement
may be used with <CODE>IO_THREAD</CODE> and <CODE>SQL_THREAD</CODE> options. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Disables update logging if the user has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.
 Ignored otherwise. (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Re-enables update logging if the user has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.
 Ignored otherwise. (Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=n</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Skip the next <CODE>n</CODE> events from the master. Only valid when
the slave thread is not running, otherwise, gives an error. Useful for
recovering from replication glitches.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Deletes all binary logs listed in the index file, resetting the binlog
index file to be empty. In pre-3.23.26 versions, use <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE>.
(Master)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Makes the slave forget its replication position in the master
logs. In pre 3.23.26 versions the command was called
<CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE>. (Slave)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>LOAD TABLE tblname FROM MASTER</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Downloads a copy of the table from master to the slave. Implemented
 mainly for debugging of <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE>, but some ``gourmet''
 users might find it useful for other things. Do not use it if you consider
 yourself the average ``non-hacker'' type user.
 Requires that the replication user which is used to connect to the master has
 <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> and <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privileges on the master.
 Please read the timeout notes in the description of <CODE>LOAD DATA
 FROM MASTER</CODE> below, they apply here too.

<TR><TD><CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Available starting in 4.0.0. Takes a snapshot of the master and copies
 it to the slave.
 Requires that the replication user which is used to connect to the master has
 <CODE>RELOAD</CODE> and <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privileges on the master.
 Updates the values of <CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE</CODE> and
 <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> so that the slave will start replicating from the
 correct position. Will honor table and database exclusion rules
 specified with <CODE>replicate-*</CODE> options. So far works only with
 <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables and acquires a global read lock on the master while
 taking the snapshot. In the future it is planned to make it work with
 <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables and to remove the need for global read lock using
 the non-blocking online backup feature.

 If you are loading big tables, you may have to increase the values
 of <CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE> and <CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE>
 on both your master and slave ; see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

 Note that <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> copy any
 tables from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database.  This is to make it easy to have
 different users and privileges on the master and the slave.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO master_def_list</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Changes the master parameters to the values specified in
<CODE>master_def_list</CODE> and restarts the slave thread. <CODE>master_def_list</CODE>
is a comma-separated list of <CODE>master_def</CODE> where <CODE>master_def</CODE> is
one of the following: <CODE>MASTER_HOST</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_USER</CODE>,
<CODE>MASTER_PASSWORD</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_PORT</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY</CODE>,
<CODE>MASTER_LOG_FILE</CODE>, <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE>. For example:


<PRE>
CHANGE MASTER TO
  MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',
  MASTER_USER='replication',
  MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',
  MASTER_PORT=3306,
  MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',
  MASTER_LOG_POS=4;
</PRE>

You only need to specify the values that need to be changed. The values that
you omit will stay the same with the exception of when you change the host or
the port. In that case, the slave will assume that since you are connecting to
a different host or a different port, the master is different. Therefore, the
old values of log and position are not applicable anymore, and will
automatically be reset to an empty string and 0, respectively (the start
values). Note that if you restart the slave, it will remember its last master.
If this is not desirable, you should delete the <TT>`master.info'</TT> file before
restarting, and the slave will read its master from <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or the
command-line.

This command is useful for setting up a slave when you have the snapshot of
the master and have recorded the log and the offset on the master that the
snapshot corresponds to. You can run
 <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',
 MASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master</CODE> on the slave after restoring the
snapshot.

<TR><TD><CODE>SHOW NEW MASTER FOR SLAVE WITH MASTER_LOG_FILE='logfile' AND
 MASTER_LOG_POS=pos AND
MASTER_LOG_SEQ=log_seq AND MASTER_SERVER_ID=server_id</CODE> </TD><TD> This command is used when a slave of a possibly dead/unavailable master
needs to be switched to replicate off another slave that has been
replicating the same master. The command will return recalculated
replication coordinates (the slave's current binary log file
name and position within that file). The output can be used in a subsequent
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command. Normal users should never need to run
this command. It is primarily reserved for internal use by the fail-safe
replication code. We may later change the syntax if we find a more
intuitive way to describe this operation.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'logname'</CODE>
 </TD><TD> Available starting in Version 3.23.28. Deletes all the
replication logs that are listed in the log
index as being prior to the specified log, and removes them from the
log index, so that the given log now becomes the first. Example:


<PRE>
PURGE MASTER LOGS TO 'mysql-bin.010'
</PRE>

This command will do nothing and fail with an error if you have an
active slave that is currently reading one of the logs you are trying to
delete. However, if you have a dormant slave, and happen to purge one of
the logs it wants to read, the slave will be unable to replicate once it
comes up.  The command is safe to run while slaves are replicating -- you
do not need to stop them.

You must first check all the slaves with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> to
see which log they are on, then do a listing of the logs on the
master with <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>, find the earliest log among all
the slaves (if all the slaves are up to date, this will be the
last log on the list), backup all the logs you are about to delete
(optional) and purge up to the target log.

<H3><A NAME="Replication_FAQ" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_FAQ">4.10.7  Replication FAQ</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I configure a slave if the master is already running
and I do not want to stop it?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: There are several options. If you have taken a backup of the
master at some point and recorded the binlog name and offset ( from the
output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> ) corresponding to the snapshot, do
the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Make sure unique server id is assigned to the slave.
<LI>

Execute <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master-host-name',
 MASTER_USER='master-user-name', MASTER_PASSWORD='master-pass',
 MASTER_LOG_FILE='recorded-log-name', MASTER_LOG_POS=recorded_log_pos</CODE>
<LI>

Execute <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
If you do not have a backup of the master already, here is a quick way to
do it consistently:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>gtar zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql</CODE> ( or a variation of this)
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> - make sure to record the output - you will need it
later
<LI>

<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
Afterwards, follow the instructions for the case when you have a snapshot and
have recorded the log name and offset. You can use the same snapshot to set up
several slaves. As long as the binary logs of the master are left intact, you
can wait as long as several days or in some cases maybe a month to set up a
slave once you have the snapshot of the master. In theory the waiting gap can
be infinite. The two practical limitations is the diskspace of the master
getting filled with old logs, and the amount of time it will take the slave to
catch up.

</P>
<P>
In version 4.0.0 and newer, you can also use <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM
MASTER</CODE>.  This is a convenient command that will take a snapshot,
restore it to the slave, and adjust the log name and offset on the slave
all at once. In the future, <CODE>LOAD DATA FROM MASTER</CODE> will be the
recommended way to set up a slave.  Be warned, howerver, that the read
lock may be held for a long time if you use this command. It is not yet
implemented as efficiently as we would like to have it. If you have
large tables, the preferred method at this time is still with a local
<CODE>tar</CODE> snapshot after executing <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Does the slave need to be connected to the master all the time?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: No, it does not. You can have the slave go down or stay
disconnected for hours or even days, then reconnect, catch up on the
updates, and then disconnect or go down for a while again. So you can,
for example, use master-slave setup over a dial-up link that is up only
for short periods of time. The implications of that are that at any
given time the slave is not guaranteed to be in sync with the master
unless you take some special measures. In the future, we will have the
option to block the master until at least one slave is in sync.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I force the master to block updates until the slave catches
up?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: Execute the following commands:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Master: <CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE>
<LI>

Master: <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> - record the log name and the offset
<LI>

Slave: <CODE>SELECT MASTER_POS_WAIT('recorded_log_name', recorded_log_offset)</CODE>
When the select returns, the slave is currently in sync with the master
<LI>

Master: <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> - now the master will continue updates.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX825"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: Why do I sometimes see more than one <CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread on
the master after I have restarted the slave?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: <CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> is a continuous process that is handled by the
server in the following way:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Catch up on the updates.
<LI>

Once there are no more updates left, go into <CODE>pthread_cond_wait()</CODE>,
from which we can be awakened either by an update or a kill.
<LI>

On wake up, check the reason. If we are not supposed to die, continue
the <CODE>Binlog_dump</CODE> loop.
<LI>

If there is some fatal error, such as detecting a dead client,
terminate the loop.
</UL>

<P>
So if the slave thread stops on the slave, the corresponding
<CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread on the master will not notice it until after
at least one update to the master (or a kill), which is needed to wake
it up from <CODE>pthread_cond_wait()</CODE>.  In the meantime, the slave
could have opened another connection, which resulted in another
<CODE>Binlog_Dump</CODE> thread.

</P>
<P>
The above problem should not be present in Version 3.23.26 and later
versions.  In Version 3.23.26 we added <CODE>server-id</CODE> to each
replication server, and now all the old zombie threads are killed on the
master when a new replication thread connects from the same slave

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I rotate replication logs?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: In Version 3.23.28 you should use <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS
TO</CODE> command after determining which logs can be deleted, and optionally
backing them up first. In earlier versions the process is much more
painful, and cannot be safely done without stopping all the slaves in
the case that you plan to re-use log names. You will need to stop the
slave threads, edit the binary log index file, delete all the old logs,
restart the master, start slave threads, and then remove the old log files.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How do I upgrade on a hot replication setup?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: If you are upgrading  pre-3.23.26 versions, you should just
lock the master tables, let the slave catch up, then run <CODE>FLUSH
MASTER</CODE> on the master, and <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> on the slave to reset the
logs, then restart new versions of the master and the slave. Note that
the slave can stay down for some time -- since the master is logging
all the updates, the slave will be able to catch up once it is up and
can connect.

</P>
<P>
After 3.23.26, we have locked the replication protocol for modifications, so
you can upgrade masters and slave on the fly to a newer 3.23 version and you
can have different versions of MySQL running on the slave and the
master, as long as they are both newer than 3.23.26.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX826"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What issues should I be aware of when setting up two-way
replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication currently does not support any
locking protocol between master and slave to guarantee the atomicity of
a distributed (cross-server) update. In other words, it is possible
for client A to make an update to  co-master 1, and in the meantime,
before it propagates to co-master 2, client B could make an update to
co-master 2 that will make the update of client A work differently than
it did on co-master 1. Thus when the update of client A will make it
to co-master 2, it will produce  tables that will be different from
what you have on co-master 1, even after all the updates from co-master
2 have also propagated. So you should not co-chain two servers in a
two-way replication relationship, unless you are sure that you updates
can safely happen in any order, or unless you take care of mis-ordered
updates somehow in the client code.

</P>

<P>
You must also realise that two-way replication actually does not improve
performance very much, if at all, as far as updates are concerned. Both
servers need to do the same amount of updates each, as you would have
one server do. The only difference is that there will be a little less
lock contention, because the updates originating on another server will
be serialised in one slave thread. This benefit, though, might be
offset by network delays.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX827"></A>
<A NAME="IDX828"></A>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to improve performance of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: You should set up one server as the master, and direct all
writes to it, and configure as many slaves as you have the money and
rackspace for, distributing the reads among the master and the slaves.
You can also start the slaves with <CODE>--skip-bdb</CODE>,
<CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> and <CODE>--delay-key-write=ALL</CODE>
to get speed improvements for the slave.  In this case the slave will
use non-transactional <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables instead of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables
to get more speed.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: What should I do to prepare my client code to use
performance-enhancing replication?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:
If the part of your code that is responsible for database access has
been properly abstracted/modularised, converting it to run with the
replicated setup should be very smooth and easy -- just change the
implementation of your database access to read from some slave or the
master, and to always write to the master. If your code does not have
this level of abstraction,
setting up a replicated system will give you an opportunity/motivation
to it clean up.
 You should start by creating a wrapper library
/module with the following functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_connect()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_reader_query()</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>safe_writer_query()</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>safe_</CODE> means that the function will take care of handling all
the error conditions.

</P>
<P>
You should then convert your client code to use the wrapper library.
It may be a painful and scary process at first, but it will pay off in
the long run. All applications that follow the above pattern will be
able to take advantage of one-master/many slaves solution.  The
code will be a lot easier to maintain, and adding troubleshooting
options will be trivial. You will just need to modify one or two
functions, for example, to log how long each query took, or which
query, among your many thousands, gave you an error. If you have
written a lot of code already, you may want to automate the conversion
task by using Monty's <CODE>replace</CODE> utility, which comes with the
standard distribution of MySQL, or just write your own Perl script.
Hopefully, your code follows some recognisable pattern. If not, then
you are probably better off rewriting it anyway, or at least going
through and manually beating it into a pattern.

</P>
<P>
Note that, of course, you can use different names for the
functions. What is important is having unified interface for connecting
for reads, connecting for writes, doing a read, and doing a write.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: When and how much can MySQL replication improve the performance
of my system?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: MySQL replication is most beneficial for a system
with frequent reads and not so frequent writes. In theory, by using a
one master/many slaves setup you can scale by adding more slaves until
you either run out of network bandwidth, or your update
load grows to the point
that the master cannot handle it.

</P>
<P>
In order to determine how many slaves you can get before the added
benefits begin to level out, and how much you can improve performance
of your site, you need to know your query patterns, and empirically
 (by benchmarking) determine the relationship between the throughput
on reads (reads per second, or <CODE>max_reads</CODE>) and on writes
<CODE>max_writes</CODE>) on a typical master and a typical slave. The
example here will show you a rather simplified calculation of what you
can get with replication for our imagined system.

</P>
<P>
Let's say our system load consists of 10% writes and 90% reads, and we
have determined that <CODE>max_reads</CODE> = 1200 - 2 * <CODE>max_writes</CODE>,
or in other words, our system can do 1200 reads per second with no
writes, our average write is twice as slow as average read,
and the relationship is
linear. Let us suppose that our master and slave are of the same
capacity, and we have N slaves and 1 master. Then we have for each
server (master or slave):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 1200 - 2 * writes</CODE> (from bencmarks)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>reads = 9* writes / (N + 1) </CODE> (reads split, but writes go
to all servers)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>9*writes/(N+1) + 2 * writes = 1200</CODE>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>writes = 1200/(2 + 9/(N+1)</CODE>

</P>
<P>
So if N = 0, which means we have no replication, our system can handle
1200/11, about 109 writes per second (which means we will have 9 times
as many reads due to the nature of our application).

</P>
<P>
If N = 1, we can get up to 184 writes per second.

</P>
<P>
If N = 8, we get up to 400.

</P>
<P>
If N = 17, 480 writes.

</P>
<P>
Eventually as N approaches infinity (and our budget negative infinity),
we can get very close to 600 writes per second, increasing system
throughput about 5.5 times. However, with only 8 servers, we increased
it almost 4 times already.

</P>
<P>
Note that our computations assumed infinite network bandwidth, and
neglected several other factors that could turn out to be significant on
your system. In many cases, you may not be able to make a computation
similar to the one above that will accurately predict what will happen
on your system if you add N replication slaves. However, answering the
following questions should help you decided whether and how much, if at
all, the replication will improve the performance of your system:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

What is the read/write ratio on your system?
<LI>

How much more write load can one server handle if you reduce the reads?
<LI>

How many slaves do you have bandwidth for on your network?
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How can I use replication to provide redundancy/high
availability?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: With the currently available features, you would have to
set up a master and a slave (or several slaves), and write a script
that will monitor the
master to see if it is up, and instruct your applications and
the slaves of the master change in case of failure. Some suggestions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To tell a slave to change the master use the <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> command.
<LI>

A good way to keep your applications informed as to the location of the
master is by having a dynamic DNS entry for the master.
With <CODE>bind</CODE> you can use <TT>`nsupdate'</TT> to dynamically update your DNS.
<LI>

You should run your slaves with the <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option and without
<CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE>. This way the slave will be ready to become a
master as soon as you issue <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE>; <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>, and
<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> on the other slaves. It will also help you catch
spurious updates that may happen because of misconfiguration of the
slave (ideally, you want to configure access rights so that no client
can update the slave, except for the slave thread) combined with the
bugs in your client programs (they should never update the slave
directly).

</UL>

<P>
We are currently working on integrating an automatic master election
system into MySQL, but until it is ready, you will have to
create your own monitoring tools.

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Q</STRONG>: How does the slave server keep track of where it is on the master?

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>A</STRONG>: The slave uses a file in the the data directory defined by the
<CODE>master-info-file=filename</CODE> path. This file holds all the information
needed by the slave to request new updates. The file contains the following
information:

<H3><A NAME="Replication_Problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#Replication_Problems">4.10.8  Troubleshooting Replication</A></H3>

<P>
If you have followed the instructions, and your replication setup is not
working, first eliminate the user error factor by checking the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Is the master logging to the binary log? Check with <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE>.
If it is, <CODE>Position</CODE> will be non-zero. If not, verify that you have
given the master <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option and have set <CODE>server-id</CODE>.
<LI>

Is the slave running? Check with <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. The answer is found
in <CODE>Slave_running</CODE> column. If not, verify slave options and check the
error log for messages.
<LI>

If the slave is running, did it establish connection with the master? Do
<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>, find the thread with <CODE>system user</CODE> value in
<CODE>User</CODE> column and <CODE>none</CODE> in the <CODE>Host</CODE> column, and check the
<CODE>State</CODE> column. If it says <CODE>connecting to master</CODE>, verify the
privileges for the replication user on the master, master host name, your
DNS setup, whether the master is actually running, whether it is reachable
from the slave, and if all that seems okay, read the error logs.
<LI>

If the slave was running, but then stopped, look at SHOW SLAVE STATUS
output and check the error logs. It usually
happens when some query that succeeded on the master fails on the slave. This
should never happen if you have taken a proper snapshot of the master, and
never modify the data on the slave outside of the slave thread. If it does,
it is a bug, read below on how to report it.
<LI>

If a query on that succeeded on the master refuses to run on the slave, and
a full database resync ( the proper thing to do ) does not seem feasible,
try the following:

<UL>
<LI>

First see if there is some stray record in the way. Understand how it got
there, then delete it and run <CODE>SLAVE START</CODE>
<LI>

If the above does not work or does not apply, try to understand if it would
be safe to make the update manually ( if needed) and then ignore the next
query from the master.
<LI>

If you have decided you can skip the next query, do
<CODE>SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START;</CODE> to skip a query that
does not use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> or <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>,  or
<CODE>SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=2; SLAVE START;</CODE> otherwise. The reason
queries that use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> or <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>
are different is that they take two events in the binary log of the master.

<LI>

If you are sure the slave started out perfectly in sync with the master,
and no one has updated  the tables involved outside of slave thread,
report the bug, so
you will not have to do the above tricks again.
</UL>

<LI>

Make sure you are not running into an old bug by upgrading to the most recent
version.
<LI>

If all else fails, read the error logs. If they are big,
<CODE>grep -i slave /path/to/your-log.err</CODE> on the slave. There is no
generic pattern to search for on the master, as the only errors it logs
are general system errors -- if it can, it will send the error to the slave
when things go wrong.
</UL>

<P>
When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and replication
still either does not work at all or is unstable, it is time to start working
on a bug report. We need to get as much info as possible from you to be able
to track down the bug. Please do spend some time and effort preparing a good
bug report. Ideally, we would like to have a test case in the format found in
<CODE>mysql-test/t/rpl*</CODE> directory of the source tree. If you submit a test
case like that, you can expect a patch within a day or two in most cases,
although, of course, you mileage may vary depending on a number of factors.

</P>
<P>
The second best option is to write a simple program with easily configurable
connection arguments for the master and the slave that will demonstrate
the problem on our systems. You can write one in Perl or in C, depending
on which language you know better.

</P>
<P>
If you have one of the above ways to demonstrate the bug, use
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> to prepare a bug report and send it to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a>. If you have a phantom -- a problem that
does occur but you cannot duplicate "at will":

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Verify that there is no user error involved. For example, if you update the
slave outside of the slave thread, the data will be out of sync, and you can
have unique key violations on updates, in which case the slave thread will
stop and wait for you to clean up the tables manually to bring them in sync.
<LI>

Run slave with <CODE>log-slave-updates</CODE> and <CODE>log-bin</CODE> -- this will keep
a log of all updates on the slave.
<LI>

Save all evidence before resetting the replication. If we have no or only
sketchy information, it would take us a while to track down the problem. The
evidence you should collect is:

<UL>
<LI>

All binary logs on the master
<LI>

All binary log on the slave
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> on the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

The output of <CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> on the master at the time
you have discovered the problem
<LI>

Error logs on the master and on the slave
</UL>

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> to examine the binary logs. The following should
be helpful
to find the trouble query, for example:

<PRE>
mysqlbinlog -j pos_from_slave_status /path/to/log_from_slave_status | head
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Once you have collected the evidence on the phantom problem, try hard to
isolate it into a separate test case first. Then report the problem to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> with as much info as possible.

<H1><A NAME="MySQL_Optimisation" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_Optimisation">5  MySQL Optimisation</A></H1>

<P>
Optimisation is a complicated task because it ultimately requires
understanding of the whole system. While it may be possible to do some
local optimisations with small knowledge of your system or application,
the more optimal you want your system to become the more you will have
to know about it.

</P>
<P>
This chapter will try to explain and give some examples of different
ways to optimise MySQL.  Remember, however, that there are
always some (increasingly harder) additional ways to make the system
even faster.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="Optimise_Overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#Optimise_Overview">5.1  Optimisation Overview</A></H2>

<P>
The most important part for getting a system fast is of course the basic
design. You also need to know what kinds of things your system will be
doing, and what your bottlenecks are.

</P>
<P>
The most common bottlenecks are:

<UL>
<LI>Disk seeks.

It takes time for the disk to find a piece of data. With modern disks in
1999, the mean time for this is usually lower than 10ms, so we can in
theory do about 100 seeks a second. This time improves slowly with new
disks and is very hard to optimise for a single table. The way to
optimise this is to spread the data on more than one disk.

<LI>Disk reading/writing.

When the disk is at the correct position we need to read the data. With
modern disks in 1999, one disk delivers something like 10-20MB/s. This
is easier to optimise than seeks because you can read in parallel from
multiple disks.

<LI>CPU cycles.

When we have the data in main memory (or if it already were
there) we need to process it to get to our result. Having small
tables compared to the memory is the most common limiting
factor. But then, with small tables speed is usually not the problem.

<LI>Memory bandwidth.

When the CPU needs more data than can fit in the CPU cache the main
memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck. This is an uncommon bottleneck
for most systems, but one should be aware of it.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Design_Limitations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Design_Limitations">5.1.1  MySQL Design Limitations/Tradeoffs</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX829"></A>
<A NAME="IDX830"></A>

</P>
<P>
When using the MyISAM storage engine, MySQL uses extremely fast table
locking (multiple readers / single writers). The biggest problem with
this table type is a if you have a mix of a steady stream of updates and
slow selects on the same table.  If this is a problem with some tables,
you can use another table type for these. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can work with both transactional and not transactional tables.  To
be able to work smoothly with not transactional tables (which can't
rollback if something goes wrong), MySQL has the following rules:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX831"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

All columns have default values.
<LI>

If you insert a 'wrong' value in a column like a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> column or a too big numerical value in a numerical
column, MySQL will instead of giving an error instead set the column to
the 'best possible value'.  For numerical values this is 0, the smallest
possible values or the largest possible value. For strings this is
either the empty string or the longest possible string that can be in
the column.
<LI>

All calculated expressions returns a value that can be used instead of
signaling an error condition. For example 1/0 returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
The reason for the above rules is that we can't check these conditions
before the query starts to execute.  If we encounter a problem after
updating a few rows, we can't just rollback as the table type may not
support this.  We can't stop because in that case the update would be
'half done' which is probably the worst possible scenario.  In this case
it's better to 'do the best you can' and then continue as if nothing
happened.

</P>
<P>
The above means that one should not use MySQL to check fields content,
but one should do this in the application.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Portability" HREF="manual_toc.html#Portability">5.1.2  Portability</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX832"></A>
<A NAME="IDX833"></A>
<A NAME="IDX834"></A>

</P>
<P>
Because all SQL servers implement different parts of SQL, it takes work to
write portable SQL applications. For very simple selects/inserts it is
very easy, but the more you need the harder it gets. If you want an
application that is fast with many databases it becomes even harder!

</P>
<P>
To make a complex application portable you need to choose a number of
SQL servers that it should work with.

</P>
<P>
You can use the MySQL <CODE>crash-me</CODE> program/web-page
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php">http://www.mysql.com/information/crash-me.php</a> to find functions,
types, and limits you can use with a selection of database
servers. Crash-me now tests far from everything possible, but it
is still comprehensive with about 450 things tested.

</P>
<P>
For example, you shouldn't have column names longer than 18 characters
if you want to be able to use Informix or DB2.

</P>
<P>
Both the MySQL benchmarks and <CODE>crash-me</CODE> programs are very
database-independent.  By taking a look at how we have handled this, you
can get a feeling for what you have to do to write your application
database-independent.  The benchmarks themselves can be found in the
<TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory in the MySQL source
distribution. They are written in Perl with DBI database interface
(which solves the access part of the problem).

</P>
<P>
See <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html">http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks.html</a> for the results
from this benchmark.

</P>
<P>
As you can see in these results, all databases have some weak points. That
is, they have different design compromises that lead to different
behaviour.

</P>
<P>
If you strive for database independence, you need to get a good feeling
for each SQL server's bottlenecks. MySQL is very fast in
retrieving and updating things, but will have a problem in mixing slow
readers/writers on the same table. Oracle, on the other hand, has a big
problem when you try to access rows that you have recently updated
(until they are flushed to disk). Transaction databases in general are
not very good at generating summary tables from log tables, as in this
case row locking is almost useless.

</P>
<P>
To get your application <EM>really</EM> database-independent, you need to define
an easy extendable interface through which you manipulate your data. As
C++ is available on most systems, it makes sense to use a C++ classes
interface to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you use some specific feature for some database (like the
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command in MySQL), you should code a method for
the other SQL servers to implement the same feature (but slower).  With
MySQL you can use the <CODE>/*!  */</CODE> syntax to add
MySQL-specific keywords to a query.  The code inside
<CODE>/**/</CODE> will be treated as a comment (ignored) by most other SQL
servers.

</P>
<P>
If high performance is more important than exactness, as in some
web applications, it is possibile to create an application layer that
caches all results to give you even higher performance. By letting
old results 'expire' after a while, you can keep the cache reasonably
fresh.  This provides a method to handle high load spikes, in which case
you can dynamically increase the cache and set the expire timeout higher
until things get back to normal.

</P>
<P>
In this case the table creation information should contain information
of the initial size of the cache and how often the table should normally
be refreshed.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Internal_use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Internal_use">5.1.3  What Have We Used MySQL For?</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX835"></A>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>

</P>
<P>
During MySQL initial development, the features of MySQL
were made to fit our largest customer. They handle data warehousing for a
couple of the biggest retailers in Sweden.

</P>
<P>
From all stores, we get weekly summaries of all bonus card transactions,
and we are expected to provide useful information for the store owners
to help them find how their advertisement campaigns are affecting their
customers.

</P>
<P>
The data is quite huge (about 7 million summary transactions per month),
and we have data for 4-10 years that we need to present to the users.
We got weekly requests from the customers that they want to get
'instant' access to new reports from this data.

</P>
<P>
We solved this by storing all information per month in compressed
'transaction' tables. We have a set of simple macros (script) that
generates summary tables grouped by different criteria (product group,
customer id, store ...) from the transaction tables.  The reports are
web pages that are dynamically generated by a small Perl script that
parses a web page, executes the SQL statements in it, and inserts the
results. We would have used PHP or mod_perl instead but they were
not available at that time.

</P>
<P>
For graphical data we wrote a simple tool in <CODE>C</CODE> that can produce
GIFs based on the result of a SQL query (with some processing of the
result). This is also dynamically executed from the Perl script that
parses the <CODE>HTML</CODE> files.

</P>
<P>
In most cases a new report can simply be done by copying an existing
script and modifying the SQL query in it.  In some cases, we will need to
add more fields to an existing summary table or generate a new one, but
this is also quite simple, as we keep all transactions tables on disk.
(Currently we have at least 50G of transactions tables and 200G of other
customer data.)

</P>
<P>
We also let our customers access the summary tables directly with ODBC
so that the advanced users can themselves experiment with the data.

</P>
<P>
We haven't had any problems handling this with quite modest Sun Ultra
SPARCstation (2x200 Mhz). We recently upgraded one of our servers to a 2
CPU 400 Mhz UltraSPARC, and we are now planning to start handling
transactions on the product level, which would mean a ten-fold increase
of data. We think we can keep up with this by just adding more disk to
our systems.

</P>
<P>
We are also experimenting with Intel-Linux to be able to get more CPU
power cheaper. Now that we have the binary portable database format (new
in Version 3.23), we will start to use this for some parts of the application.

</P>
<P>
Our initial feelings are that Linux will perform much better on
low-to-medium load and Solaris will perform better when you start to get a
high load because of extreme disk IO, but we don't yet have anything
conclusive about this. After some discussion with a Linux Kernel
developer, this might be a side effect of Linux giving so much resources
to the batch job that the interactive performance gets very low. This
makes the machine feel very slow and unresponsive while big batches are
going. Hopefully this will be better handled in future Linux Kernels.

</P>

This should contain a technical description of the MySQL

written yet. Currently, you can get a good idea of the benchmark by
looking at the code and results in the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory in any
MySQL source distributions.

</P>
<P>
This benchmark suite is meant to be a benchmark that will tell any user
what things a given SQL implementation performs well or poorly at.

</P>
<P>
Note that this benchmark is single threaded, so it measures the minimum
time for the operations. We plan to in the future add a lot of
multi-threaded tests to the benchmark suite.

You should definitely benchmark your application and database to find
out where the bottlenecks are.  By fixing it (or by replacing the
bottleneck with a 'dummy module') you can then easily identify the next
bottleneck (and so on).  Even if the overall performance for your
application is sufficient, you should at least make a plan for each
bottleneck, and decide how to solve it if someday you really need the
extra performance.

</P>
<P>
For an example of portable benchmark programs, look at the MySQL
benchmark suite. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Benchmarks">5.1.4  The MySQL Benchmark Suite</A>. You
can take any program from this suite and modify it for your needs. By doing
this, you can try different solutions to your problem and test which is really
the fastest solution for you.

</P>
<P>
It is very common that some problems only occur when the system is very
heavily loaded. We have had many customers who contact us when they
have a (tested) system in production and have encountered load problems. In
every one of these cases so far, it has been problems with basic design
(table scans are <STRONG>not good</STRONG> at high load) or OS/Library issues. Most of
this would be a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> easier to fix if the systems were not
already in production.

</P>
<P>
To avoid problems like this, you should put some effort into benchmarking
your whole application under the worst possible load!  You can use
Super Smack for this, and it is available at:
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz">http://www.mysql.com/Downloads/super-smack/super-smack-1.0.tar.gz</a>.

First, one thing that affects all queries: The more complex permission
system setup you have, the more overhead you get.

</P>
<P>
If you do not have any <CODE>GRANT</CODE> statements done, MySQL will
optimise the permission checking somewhat. So if you have a very high
volume it may be worth the time to avoid grants. Otherwise, more
permission check results in a larger overhead.

</P>
<P>
If your problem is with some explicit MySQL function, you can
always time this in the MySQL client:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1);
+------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,1+1) |
+------------------------+
|                      0 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.32 sec)

<P>
The above shows that MySQL can execute 1,000,000 <CODE>+</CODE>
expressions in 0.32 seconds on a <CODE>PentiumII 400MHz</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL functions should be very optimised, but there may be
some exceptions, and the <CODE>BENCHMARK(loop_count,expression)</CODE> is a
great tool to find out if this is a problem with your query.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="EXPLAIN" HREF="manual_toc.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX845"></A>
<A NAME="IDX846"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
    EXPLAIN tbl_name
or  EXPLAIN SELECT select_options
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>EXPLAIN tbl_name</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you precede a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement with the keyword <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>,
MySQL explains how it would process the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, providing
information about how tables are joined and in which order.

</P>
<P>
With the help of <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, you can see when you must add indexes
to tables to get a faster <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that uses indexes to find the
records.

</P>
<P>
You should frequently run <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> to update table statistics
such as cardinality of keys which can affect the choices the optimiser
makes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also see if the optimiser joins the tables in an optimal
order. To force the optimiser to use a specific join order for a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, add a <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
For non-simple joins, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> returns a row of information for each
table used in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement. The tables are listed in the order
they would be read.  MySQL resolves all joins using a single-sweep
multi-join method. This means that MySQL reads a row from the first
table, then finds a matching row in the second table, then in the third table
and so on. When all tables are processed, it outputs the selected columns and
backtracks through the table list until a table is found for which there are
more matching rows. The next row is read from this table and the process
continues with the next table.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL version 4.1 the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output was changed to work better
with constructs like <CODE>UNION</CODE>s, subqueries and derived tables. Most
notable is the addition of two new columns: <CODE>id</CODE> and <CODE>select_type</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> consists of the following columns:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> identifier, the sequential number of this <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
within the query.

<DT><CODE>select_type</CODE>
<DD>
Type of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> clause, which can be any of the following:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SIMPLE</CODE>
<DD>
Simple <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (without <CODE>UNION</CODE>s or subqueries).

<DT><CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>
<DD>
Outermost <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>UNION</CODE>
<DD>
Second and further <CODE>UNION</CODE> <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s.

<DT><CODE>DEPENDENT UNION</CODE>
<DD>
Second and further <CODE>UNION</CODE> <CODE>SELECTS</CODE>s, dependent on outer
subquery.

<DT><CODE>SUBSELECT</CODE>
<DD>
First <CODE>SELECT</CODE> in subquery.

<DT><CODE>DEPENDENT SUBSELECT</CODE>
<DD>
First <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, dependent on outer subquery.

<DT><CODE>DERIVED</CODE>
<DD>
Derived table <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>table</CODE>
<DD>
The table to which the row of output refers.

<DT><CODE>type</CODE>
<DD>
The join type. The different join types are listed here, ordered from
best to worst type:

<A NAME="IDX847"></A>
<A NAME="IDX848"></A>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>system</CODE>
<DD>
The table has only one row (= system table). This is a special case of
the <CODE>const</CODE> join type.

<A NAME="IDX849"></A>
<A NAME="IDX850"></A>
<DT><CODE>const</CODE>
<DD>
The table has at most one matching row, which will be read at the start
of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the column in
this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the
optimiser. <CODE>const</CODE> tables are very fast as they are read only once!

<DT><CODE>eq_ref</CODE>
<DD>
One row will be read from this table for each combination of rows from
the previous tables.  This is the best possible join type, other than the
<CODE>const</CODE> types.  It is used when all parts of an index are used by
the join and the index is <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
All rows with matching index values will be read from this table for each
combination of rows from the previous tables.  <CODE>ref</CODE> is used if the join
uses only a leftmost prefix of the key, or if the key is not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> (in other words, if the join cannot select a single
row based on the key value).  If the key that is used matches only a few rows,
this join type is good.

<DT><CODE>range</CODE>
<DD>
Only rows that are in a given range will be retrieved, using an index to
select the rows.  The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates which index is used.
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> contains the longest key part that was used.
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column will be <CODE>NULL</CODE> for this type.

<DT><CODE>index</CODE>
<DD>
This is the same as <CODE>ALL</CODE>, except that only the index tree is
scanned.  This is usually faster than <CODE>ALL</CODE>, as the index file is usually
smaller than the datafile.

<DT><CODE>ALL</CODE>
<DD>
A full table scan will be done for each combination of rows from the
previous tables.  This is normally not good if the table is the first
table not marked <CODE>const</CODE>, and usually <STRONG>very</STRONG> bad in all other
cases. You normally can avoid <CODE>ALL</CODE> by adding more indexes, so that
the row can be retrieved based on constant values or column values from
earlier tables.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>possible_keys</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> column indicates which indexes MySQL
could use to find the rows in this table. Note that this column is
totally independent of the order of the tables. That means that some of
the keys in <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> may not be usable in practice with the
generated table order.

If this column is empty, there are no relevant indexes. In this case,
you may be able to improve the performance of your query by examining
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause to see if it refers to some column or columns
that would be suitable for indexing.  If so, create an appropriate index
and check the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

To see what indexes a table has, use <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>key</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key</CODE> column indicates the key (index) that MySQL actually
decided to use. The key is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if no index was chosen. To force
MySQL to use an key listed in the <CODE>possible_keys</CODE> column, use
<CODE>USE KEY/IGNORE KEY</CODE> in your query.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

Also, running <CODE>myisamchk --analyze</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#myisamchk_syntax">4.4.6.1  <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> Invocation Syntax</A>) or
<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>) on the table will help the
optimiser choose better indexes.

<DT><CODE>key_len</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>key_len</CODE> column indicates the length of the key that
MySQL decided to use.  The length is <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the
<CODE>key</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Note that this tells us how many parts of a
multi-part key MySQL will actually use.

<DT><CODE>ref</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>ref</CODE> column shows which columns or constants are used with the
<CODE>key</CODE> to select rows from the table.

<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>rows</CODE> column indicates the number of rows MySQL
believes it must examine to execute the query.

<DT><CODE>Extra</CODE>
<DD>
This column contains additional information of how MySQL will
resolve the query. Here is an explanation of the different text
strings that can be found in this column:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>Distinct</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will not continue searching for more rows for the current row
combination after it has found the first matching row.

<DT><CODE>Not exists</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL was able to do a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> optimisation on the
query and will not examine more rows in this table for the previous row
combination after it finds one row that matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> criteria.

Here is an example for this:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id=t2.id WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

Assume that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> is defined with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.  In this case
MySQL will scan <CODE>t1</CODE> and look up the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE>
through <CODE>t1.id</CODE>. If MySQL finds a matching row in
<CODE>t2</CODE>, it knows that <CODE>t2.id</CODE> can never be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, and will
not scan through the rest of the rows in <CODE>t2</CODE> that has the same
<CODE>id</CODE>.  In other words, for each row in <CODE>t1</CODE>, MySQL
only needs to do a single lookup in <CODE>t2</CODE>, independent of how many
matching rows there are in <CODE>t2</CODE>.

<DT><CODE><CODE>range checked for each record (index map: #)</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
MySQL didn't find a real good index to use. It will, instead, for
each row combination in the preceding tables, do a check on which index to
use (if any), and use this index to retrieve the rows from the table.  This
isn't very fast but is faster than having to do a join without
an index.

<DT><CODE>Using filesort</CODE>
<DD>
MySQL will need to do an extra pass to find out how to retrieve
the rows in sorted order.  The sort is done by going through all rows
according to the <CODE>join type</CODE> and storing the sort key + pointer to
the row for all rows that match the <CODE>WHERE</CODE>. Then the keys are
sorted. Finally the rows are retrieved in sorted order.

<DT><CODE>Using index</CODE>
<DD>
The column information is retrieved from the table using only
information in the index tree without having to do an additional seek to
read the actual row.  This can be done when all the used columns for
the table are part of the same index.

<DT><CODE>Using temporary</CODE>
<DD>
To resolve the query MySQL will need to create a
temporary table to hold the result.  This typically happens if you do an
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a different column set than you did a <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on.

<DT><CODE>Using where</CODE>
<DD>
A <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be used to restrict which rows will be
matched against the next table or sent to the client.  If you don't have
this information and the table is of type <CODE>ALL</CODE> or <CODE>index</CODE>,
you may have something wrong in your query (if you don't intend to
fetch/examine all rows from the table).
</DL>

If you want to get your queries as fast as possible, you should look out for
<CODE>Using filesort</CODE> and <CODE>Using temporary</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
You can get a good indication of how good a join is by multiplying all values
in the <CODE>rows</CODE> column of the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output. This should tell you
roughly how many rows MySQL must examine to execute the query. This
number is also used when you restrict queries with the <CODE>max_join_size</CODE>
variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following example shows how a <CODE>JOIN</CODE> can be optimised progressively
using the information provided by <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement shown here, that you examine
using <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
EXPLAIN SELECT tt.TicketNumber, tt.TimeIn,
            tt.ProjectReference, tt.EstimatedShipDate,
            tt.ActualShipDate, tt.ClientID,
            tt.ServiceCodes, tt.RepetitiveID,
            tt.CurrentProcess, tt.CurrentDPPerson,
            tt.RecordVolume, tt.DPPrinted, et.COUNTRY,
            et_1.COUNTRY, do.CUSTNAME
        FROM tt, et, et AS et_1, do
        WHERE tt.SubmitTime IS NULL
            AND tt.ActualPC = et.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID
            AND tt.ClientID = do.CUSTNMBR;
</PRE>

<P>
For this example, assume that:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The columns being compared have been declared as follows:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Table</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Column</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Column type</STRONG>

The tables have the indexes shown here:

<TR><TD><CODE>do</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>CUSTNMBR</CODE> (primary key)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<LI>

The <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> values aren't evenly distributed.
</UL>

<P>
Initially, before any optimisations have been performed, the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
statement produces the following information:

</P>

<PRE>
table type possible_keys                key  key_len ref  rows  Extra
et    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
do    ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 2135
et_1  ALL  PRIMARY                      NULL NULL    NULL 74
tt    ALL  AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL    NULL 3872
      range checked for each record (key map: 35)
</PRE>

<P>
Because <CODE>type</CODE> is <CODE>ALL</CODE> for each table, this output indicates that
MySQL is doing a full join for all tables!  This will take quite a
long time, as the product of the number of rows in each table must be
examined!  For the case at hand, this is <CODE>74 * 2135 * 74 * 3872 =
45,268,558,720</CODE> rows.  If the tables were bigger, you can only imagine how
long it would take.

</P>
<P>
One problem here is that MySQL can't (yet) use indexes on columns
efficiently if they are declared differently.  In this context,
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> are the same unless they are declared as
different lengths. Because <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE>
and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> is declared as <CODE>CHAR(15)</CODE>, there is a length
mismatch.

</P>
<P>
To fix this disparity between column lengths, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
lengthen <CODE>ActualPC</CODE> from 10 characters to 15 characters:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY ActualPC VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> and <CODE>et.EMPLOYID</CODE> are both <CODE>VARCHAR(15)</CODE>.
Executing the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> statement again produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key     key_len ref         rows    Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC,ClientID,ActualPC NULL NULL NULL 3872    Using where
do    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        2135
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et_1  ALL    PRIMARY         NULL    NULL    NULL        74
      range checked for each record (key map: 1)
et    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC 1
</PRE>

<P>
This is not perfect, but is much better (the product of the <CODE>rows</CODE>
values is now less by a factor of 74). This version is executed in a couple
of seconds.

</P>
<P>
A second alteration can be made to eliminate the column length mismatches
for the <CODE>tt.AssignedPC = et_1.EMPLOYID</CODE> and <CODE>tt.ClientID =
do.CUSTNMBR</CODE> comparisons:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tt MODIFY AssignedPC VARCHAR(15),
    -&#62;                MODIFY ClientID   VARCHAR(15);
</PRE>

<P>
Now <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces the output shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys   key      key_len ref           rows Extra
et    ALL    PRIMARY         NULL     NULL    NULL          74
tt    ref    AssignedPC,     ActualPC 15      et.EMPLOYID   52   Using where
             ClientID,
             ActualPC
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY  15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY         PRIMARY  15      tt.ClientID   1
</PRE>

<P>
This is almost as good as it can get.

</P>
<P>
The remaining problem is that, by default, MySQL assumes that values
in the <CODE>tt.ActualPC</CODE> column are evenly distributed, and that isn't the
case for the <CODE>tt</CODE> table.  Fortunately, it is easy to tell MySQL
about this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; myisamchk --analyze PATH_TO_MYSQL_DATABASE/tt
shell&#62; mysqladmin refresh
</PRE>

<P>
Now the join is perfect, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> produces this result:

</P>

<PRE>
table type   possible_keys key     key_len ref           rows Extra
tt    ALL    AssignedPC    NULL    NULL    NULL          3872 Using where
             ClientID,
             ActualPC
et    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ActualPC   1
et_1  eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.AssignedPC 1
do    eq_ref PRIMARY       PRIMARY 15      tt.ClientID   1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>rows</CODE> column in the output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> is an
educated guess from the MySQL join optimiser. To optimise a
query, you should check if the numbers are even close to the truth.  If not,
you may get better performance by using <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> in your
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement and trying to list the tables in a different order in
the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Estimating_performance" HREF="manual_toc.html#Estimating_performance">5.2.2  Estimating Query Performance</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX851"></A>
<A NAME="IDX852"></A>
<A NAME="IDX853"></A>

</P>
<P>
In most cases you can estimate the performance by counting disk seeks.
For small tables, you can usually find the row in 1 disk seek (as the
index is probably cached).  For bigger tables, you can estimate that
(using B++ tree indexes) you will need: <CODE>log(row_count) /
log(index_block_length / 3 * 2 / (index_length + data_pointer_length)) +
1</CODE> seeks to find a row.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL an index block is usually 1024 bytes and the data
pointer is usually 4 bytes. A 500,000 row table with an
index length of 3 (medium integer) gives you:
<CODE>log(500,000)/log(1024/3*2/(3+4)) + 1</CODE> = 4 seeks.

</P>
<P>
As the above index would require about 500,000 * 7 * 3/2 = 5.2M,
(assuming that the index buffers are filled to 2/3, which is typical)
you will probably have much of the index in memory and you will probably
only need 1-2 calls to read data from the OS to find the row.

</P>
<P>
For writes, however, you will need 4 seek requests (as above) to find
where to place the new index and normally 2 seeks to update the index
and write the row.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that your application will slowly
degenerate by log N!  As long as everything is cached by the OS or SQL
server things will only go marginally slower while the table gets
bigger. After the data gets too big to be cached, things will start to
go much slower until your applications is only bound by disk-seeks
(which increase by log N). To avoid this, increase the index cache as
the data grows. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

In general, when you want to make a slow <CODE>SELECT ... WHERE</CODE> faster, the
first thing to check is whether you can add an index. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>. All references between different tables
should usually be done with indexes. You can use the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> command
to determine which indexes are used for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
Some general tips:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To help MySQL optimise queries better, run <CODE>myisamchk
--analyze</CODE> on a table after it has been loaded with relevant data. This
updates a value for each index part that indicates the average number of
rows that have the same value.  (For unique indexes, this is always 1,
of course.)  MySQL will use this to decide which index to
choose when you connect two tables with 'a non-constant expression'.
You can check the result from the <CODE>analyze</CODE> run by doing <CODE>SHOW
INDEX FROM table_name</CODE> and examining the <CODE>Cardinality</CODE> column.

<LI>

To sort an index and data according to an index, use <CODE>myisamchk
--sort-index --sort-records=1</CODE> (if you want to sort on index 1). If you
have a unique index from which you want to read all records in order
according to that index, this is a good way to make that faster.  Note,
however, that this sorting isn't written optimally and will take a long
time for a large table!
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Where_optimisations" HREF="manual_toc.html#Where_optimisations">5.2.4  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX856"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX857"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimisations are put in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part here because
they are mostly used with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, but the same optimisations apply for
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> in <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Also note that this section is incomplete. MySQL does many
optimisations, and we have not had time to document them all.

</P>
<P>
Some of the optimisations performed by MySQL are listed here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Removal of unnecessary parentheses:

<PRE>
   ((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))
-&#62; (a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant folding:

<PRE>
   (a&#60;b AND b=c) AND a=5
-&#62; b&#62;5 AND b=c AND a=5
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant condition removal (needed because of constant folding):

<PRE>
   (B&#62;=5 AND B=5) OR (B=6 AND 5=5) OR (B=7 AND 5=6)
-&#62; B=5 OR B=6
</PRE>

<LI>

Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.
<LI>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> on a single table without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is retrieved
directly from the table information for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables.
This is also done for any <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> expression when used with only one
table.
<LI>

Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly
detects that some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are impossible and returns no rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HAVING</CODE> is merged with <CODE>WHERE</CODE> if you don't use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
or group functions (<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>MIN()</CODE>...).
<LI>

For each sub-join, a simpler <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is constructed to get a fast
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> evaluation for each sub-join and also to skip records as
soon as possible.
<A NAME="IDX858"></A>
<A NAME="IDX859"></A>
<LI>

All constant tables are read first, before any other tables in the query.
A constant table is:

<UL>
<LI>

An empty table or a table with 1 row.
<LI>

A table that is used with a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
index, or a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, where all index parts are used with constant
expressions and the index parts are defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

All the following tables are used as constant tables:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    -&#62;          WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
</PRE>

<LI>

The best join combination to join the tables is found by trying all
possibilities. If all columns in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and in <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> come from the same table, then this table is preferred first when
joining.
<LI>

If there is an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause and a different <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
clause, or if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> contains columns
from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary
table is created.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, MySQL will use an in-memory
temporary table.
<LI>

Each table index is queried, and the best index that spans fewer than 30% of
the rows is used. If no such index can be found, a quick table scan is used.
<LI>

In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even
consulting the datafile.  If all columns used from the index are numeric,
then only the index tree is used to resolve the query.
<LI>

Before each record is output, those that do not match the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause
are skipped.
</UL>

<P>
Some examples of queries that are very fast:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;
mysql&#62; SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        WHERE key_part_1=constant;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... LIMIT 10;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries are resolved using only the index tree (assuming
the indexed columns are numeric):

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;        WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
</PRE>

<P>
The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted
order without a separate sorting pass:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;            ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;
mysql&#62; SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;            ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC,... ;

<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is converted to a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on all columns,
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> combined with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will in many cases also

<P>
When combining <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop

In the case, assuming <CODE>t1</CODE> is used before <CODE>t2</CODE> (check with

<CODE>A LEFT JOIN B</CODE> in MySQL is implemented as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table <CODE>B</CODE> is set to be dependent on table <CODE>A</CODE> and all tables
that <CODE>A</CODE> is dependent on.

<LI>

The table <CODE>A</CODE> is set to be dependent on all tables (except <CODE>B</CODE>)
that are used in the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.

<LI>

All <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> conditions are moved to the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

All standard join optimisations are done, with the exception that a table is
always read after all tables it is dependent on.  If there is a circular
dependence then MySQL will issue an error.

<LI>

All standard <CODE>WHERE</CODE> optimisations are done.

<LI>

If there is a row in <CODE>A</CODE> that matches the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, but there
wasn't any row in <CODE>B</CODE> that matched the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition,
then an extra <CODE>B</CODE> row is generated with all columns set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> to find rows that don't exist in some
table and you have the following test: <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> in the

<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, then MySQL will stop searching after more rows
(for a particular key combination) after it has found one row that
matches the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> condition.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> is implemented analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The table read order forced by <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>STRAIGHT JOIN</CODE>
will help the join optimiser (which calculates in which order tables
should be joined) to do its work much more quickly, as there are fewer
table permutations to check.

</P>
<P>
Note that the above means that if you do a query of type:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM a,b LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL will do a full scan on <CODE>b</CODE> as the <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> will force
it to be read before <CODE>d</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The fix in this case is to change the query to:

</P>

SELECT * FROM b,a LEFT JOIN c ON (c.key=a.key) LEFT JOIN d (d.key=a.key)
         WHERE b.key=d.key

<P>
In some cases MySQL can uses index to satisfy an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> request without doing any extra sorting.

</P>
<P>
The index can also be used even if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> doesn't match the
index exactly, as long as all the unused index parts and all the extra
are <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> columns are constants in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause. The following queries will use the index to resolve the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> / <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,...
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant ORDER BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=constant GROUP BY key_part2
SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key_part1=1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 DESC
</PRE>

<P>
Some cases where MySQL can <STRONG>not</STRONG> use indexes to resolve the <CODE>ORDER
BY</CODE>: (Note that MySQL will still use indexes to find the rows that
matches the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on different keys:

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key1,key2</CODE>
<LI>

You are doing an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> using non-consecutive key parts.

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key_part2</CODE>

<LI>

You are mixing <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE>.

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY key_part1 DESC,key_part2 ASC</CODE>

<LI>

The key used to fetch the rows are not the same one that is used to
do the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>:

<CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE key2=constant ORDER BY key1</CODE>

<LI>

You are joining many tables and the columns you are doing an <CODE>ORDER
BY</CODE> on are not all from the first not-<CODE>const</CODE> table that is used to
retrieve rows (This is the first table in the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> output which
doesn't use a <CODE>const</CODE> row fetch method).

<LI>

You have different <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> expressions.

<LI>

The used table index is an index type that doesn't store rows in order.
(Like the <CODE>HASH</CODE> index in <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables).
</UL>

<P>
In the cases where MySQL have to sort the result, it uses the following
algorithm:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Read all rows according to key or by table scanning.
Rows that don't match the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause are skipped.
<LI>

Store the sort-key in a buffer (of size <CODE>sort_buffer</CODE>).
<LI>

When the buffer gets full, run a qsort on it and store the result
in a temporary file.  Save a pointer to the sorted block.
(In the case where all rows fits into the sort buffer, no temporary
file is created)
<LI>

Repeat the above until all rows have been read.
<LI>

Do a multi-merge of up to <CODE>MERGEBUFF</CODE> (7) regions to one block in
another temporary file.  Repeat until all blocks from the first file
are in the second file.
<LI>

Repeat the following until there is less than <CODE>MERGEBUFF2</CODE> (15)
blocks left.
<LI>

On the last multi-merge, only the pointer to the row (last part of
the sort-key) is written to a result file.
<LI>

Now the code in <TT>`sql/records.cc'</TT> will be used to read through them
in sorted order by using the row pointers in the result file.  To
optimise this, we read in a big block of row pointers, sort these and
then we read the rows in the sorted order into a row buffer
(<CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE>) .
</UL>

<P>
You can with <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ... ORDER BY</CODE> check if MySQL can use
indexes to resolve the query.  If you get <CODE>Using filesort</CODE> in the
<CODE>extra</CODE> column, then MySQL can't use indexes to resolve the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you want to have a higher <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> speed, you should first
see if you can get MySQL to use indexes instead of having to do an extra
sorting phase. If this is not possible, then you can do:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Increase the size of the <CODE>sort_buffer</CODE> variable.
<LI>

Increase the size of the <CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE> variable.
<LI>

Change <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to point to a dedicated disk with lots of empty space.
If you use MySQL 4.1 or later you can spread load between
several physical disks by setting <CODE>tmpdir</CODE> to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> These paths should end up on different <STRONG>physical</STRONG> disks,
not different partitions of the same disk.
</UL>

<P>
MySQL by default sorts all <CODE>GROUP BY x,y[,...]</CODE> queries as if you
would have specified <CODE>ORDER BY x,y[,...]</CODE>.  MySQL will optimise
away any <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> as above without any speed penalty.  If you by
in some cases don't want to have the result sorted you can specify
<CODE>ORDER BY NULL</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo SELECT a,COUNT(*) FROM bar GROUP BY a ORDER BY NULL;

In some cases MySQL will handle the query differently when you are
using <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> and not using <CODE>HAVING</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are selecting only a few rows with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, MySQL
will use indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a
full table scan.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, MySQL will end the
sorting as soon as it has found the first <CODE>#</CODE> lines instead of sorting
the whole table.
<LI>

When combining <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> with <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, MySQL will stop
as soon as it finds <CODE>#</CODE> unique rows.
<LI>

In some cases a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> can be resolved by reading the key in order
(or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until the
key value changes.  In this case <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> will not calculate any
unnecessary <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>s.
<LI>

As soon as MySQL has sent the first <CODE>#</CODE> rows to the client, it
will abort the query (if you are not using <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT 0</CODE> will always quickly return an empty set.  This is useful
to check the query and to get the column types of the result columns.
<LI>

When the server uses temporary tables to resolve the query, the
<CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> is used to calculate how much space is required.

<P>
The size of the table slows down the insertion of indexes by log N
(B-trees).

</P>
<P>
Some ways to speed up inserts:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are inserting many rows from the same client at the same time, use
multiple value lists <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements. This is much faster (many times
in some cases) than using separate <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  If you are adding
data to non-empty table, you may tune up the <CODE>bulk_insert_buffer_size</CODE>
variable to make it even faster.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

If you are inserting a lot of rows from different clients, you can get
higher speed by using the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Note that with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables you can insert rows at the same time
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are running if there are no deleted rows in the tables.
<LI>

When loading a table from a text file, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This
is usually 20 times faster than using a lot of <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

It is possible with some extra work to make <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> run even
faster when the table has many indexes. Use the following procedure:


<OL>
<LI>

Optionally create the table with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. For example, using
<CODE>mysql</CODE> or Perl-DBI.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will
remove all usage of all indexes from the table.

<LI>

Insert data into the table with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. This will not
update any indexes and will therefore be very fast.

<LI>

If you are going to only read the table in the future, run <CODE>myisampack</CODE>
on it to make it smaller. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compressed_format">7.1.2.3  Compressed Table Characteristics</A>.

<LI>

Re-create the indexes with <CODE>myisamchk -r -q
/path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This will create the index tree in memory before
writing it to disk, which is much faster because it avoids lots of disk
seeks. The resulting index tree is also perfectly balanced.

<LI>

Execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement or the shell command <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-tables</CODE>.
</OL>

Note that <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> also does the above optimisation if
you insert into an empty table; the main difference with the above
procedure is that you can let <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> allocate much more temporary
memory for the index creation that you may want MySQL to allocate for
every index recreation.

Since MySQL 4.0 you can also use
<CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS</CODE> instead of
<CODE>myisamchk --keys-used=0 -rq /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE> and
<CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS</CODE> instead of
<CODE>myisamchk -r -q /path/to/db/tbl_name</CODE>. This way you can also skip
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> steps.
<LI>

You can speed up insertions that is done over multiple statements by
locking your tables:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES a WRITE;
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (1,23),(2,34),(4,33);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO a VALUES (8,26),(6,29);
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

The main speed difference is that the index buffer is flushed to disk only
once, after all <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements have completed. Normally there would
be as many index buffer flushes as there are different <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements. Locking is not needed if you can insert all rows with a single
statement.

For transactional tables, you should use <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> instead of
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> to get a speedup.

Locking will also lower the total time of multi-connection tests, but the
maximum wait time for some threads will go up (because they wait for
locks).  For example:


<PRE>
thread 1 does 1000 inserts
thread 2, 3, and 4 does 1 insert
thread 5 does 1000 inserts
</PRE>

If you don't use locking, 2, 3, and 4 will finish before 1 and 5. If you
use locking, 2, 3, and 4 probably will not finish before 1 or 5, but the
total time should be about 40% faster.

As <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> operations are very
fast in MySQL, you will obtain better overall performance by
adding locks around everything that does more than about 5 inserts or
updates in a row.  If you do very many inserts in a row, you could do a
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> followed by an <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> once in a while
(about each 1000 rows) to allow other threads access to the table. This
would still result in a nice performance gain.

Of course, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is much faster for loading data.
</UL>

<P>
To get some more speed for both <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, enlarge the key buffer. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Update_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Update_speed">5.2.10  Speed of <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

<P>
Update queries are optimised as a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query with the additional
overhead of a write. The speed of the write is dependent on the size of
the data that is being updated and the number of indexes that are
updated.  Indexes that are not changed will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
Also, another way to get fast updates is to delay updates and then do
many updates in a row later. Doing many updates in a row is much quicker
than doing one at a time if you lock the table.

</P>
<P>
Note that, with dynamic record format, updating a record to
a longer total length may split the record.  So if you do this often,
it is very important to <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> sometimes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Delete_speed" HREF="manual_toc.html#Delete_speed">5.2.11  Speed of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Queries</A></H3>

<P>
If you want to delete all rows in the table, you should use
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE table_name</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.7  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of
indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of
the index cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

Unsorted tips for faster systems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use persistent connections to the database to avoid the connection
overhead. If you can't use persistent connections and you are doing a
lot of new connections to the database, you may want to change the value
of the <CODE>thread_cache_size</CODE> variable. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
<LI>

Always check that all your queries really use the indexes you have created
in the tables. In MySQL you can do this with the <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>
command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

Try to avoid complex <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries on <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables that are
updated a lot. This is to avoid problems with table locking.
<LI>

The new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables can insert rows in a table without deleted
rows at the same time another table is reading from it.  If this is important
for you, you should consider methods where you don't have to delete rows
or run <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> after you have deleted a lot of rows.
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY expr1,expr2...</CODE> if you mostly
retrieve rows in <CODE>expr1,expr2...</CODE> order.  By using this option after big
changes to the table, you may be able to get higher performance.
<LI>

In some cases it may make sense to introduce a column that is 'hashed'
based on information from other columns. If this column is short and
reasonably unique it may be much faster than a big index on many
columns. In MySQL it's very easy to use this extra column:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE hash=MD5(CONCAT(col1,col2))
AND col_1='constant' AND col_2='constant'</CODE>
<LI>

For tables that change a lot you should try to avoid all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns. You will get dynamic row length as soon as you
are using a single <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

It's not normally useful to split a table into different tables just
because the rows gets 'big'. To access a row, the biggest performance
hit is the disk seek to find the first byte of the row. After finding
the data most new disks can read the whole row fast enough for most
applications. The only cases where it really matters to split up a table is if
it's a dynamic row size table (see above) that you can change to a fixed
row size, or if you very often need to scan the table and don't need
most of the columns. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

If you very often need to calculate things based on information from a
lot of rows (like counts of things), it's probably much better to
introduce a new table and update the counter in real time. An update of
type <CODE>UPDATE table SET count=count+1 WHERE index_column=constant</CODE>
is very fast!

This is really important when you use MySQL table types like MyISAM and
ISAM that
only have table locking (multiple readers / single writers). This will
also give better performance with most databases, as the row locking
manager in this case will have less to do.
<LI>

If you need to collect statistics from big log tables, use summary tables
instead of scanning the whole table. Maintaining the summaries should be
much faster than trying to do statistics 'live'. It's much faster to
regenerate new summary tables from the logs when things change
(depending on business decisions) than to have to change the running
application!
<LI>

If possible, one should classify reports as 'live' or 'statistical',
where data needed for statistical reports are only generated based on
summary tables that are generated from the actual data.
<LI>

Take advantage of the fact that columns have default values. Insert
values explicitly only when the value to be inserted differs from the
default. This reduces the parsing that MySQL need to do and
improves the insert speed.
<LI>

In some cases it's convenient to pack and store data into a blob. In this
case you have to add some extra code in your application to pack/unpack
things in the blob, but this may save a lot of accesses at some stage.
This is practical when you have data that doesn't conform to a static
table structure.
<LI>

Normally you should try to keep all data non-redundant (what
is called 3rd normal form in database theory), but you should not be
afraid of duplicating things or creating summary tables if you need these
to gain more speed.
<LI>

Stored procedures or UDF (user-defined functions) may be a good way to
get more performance.  In this case you should, however, always have a way
to do this some other (slower) way if you use some database that doesn't
support this.
<LI>

You can always gain something by caching queries/answers in your
application and trying to do many inserts/updates at the same time.  If
your database supports lock tables (like MySQL and Oracle),
this should help to ensure that the index cache is only flushed once
after all updates.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! DELAYED */</CODE> when you do not need to know when your
data is written. This speeds things up because many records can be written
with a single disk write.
<LI>

Use <CODE>INSERT /*! LOW_PRIORITY */</CODE> when you want your selects to be
more important.
<LI>

Use <CODE>SELECT /*! HIGH_PRIORITY */</CODE> to get selects that jump the
queue. That is, the select is done even if there is somebody waiting to
do a write.
<LI>

Use the multi-line <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement to store many rows with one
SQL command (many SQL servers supports this).
<LI>

Use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to load bigger amounts of data. This is
faster than normal inserts and will be even faster when <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
is integrated in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Use <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns to make unique values.
<LI>

Use <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> once in a while to avoid fragmentation when
using a dynamic table format. See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables to get more speed when possible. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.
<LI>

When using a normal web server setup, images should be stored as
files. That is, store only a file reference in the database.  The main
reason for this is that a normal web server is much better at caching
files than database contents. So it it's much easier to get a fast
system if you are using files.
<LI>

Use in memory tables for non-critical data that are accessed often (like
information about the last shown banner for users that don't have
cookies).
<LI>

Columns with identical information in different tables should be
declared identical and have identical names. Before Version 3.23 you
got slow joins otherwise.

Try to keep the names simple (use <CODE>name</CODE> instead of
<CODE>customer_name</CODE> in the customer table). To make your names portable
to other SQL servers you should keep them shorter than 18 characters.
<LI>

If you need really high speed, you should take a look at the low-level
interfaces for data storage that the different SQL servers support!  For
example, by accessing the MySQL <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> directly, you could
get a speed increase of 2-5 times compared to using the SQL interface.
To be able to do this the data must be on the same server as
the application, and usually it should only be accessed by one process
(because external file locking is really slow).  One could eliminate the
above problems by introducing low-level <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> commands in the
MySQL server (this could be one easy way to get more
performance if needed).  By carefully designing the database interface,
it should be quite easy to support this types of optimisation.
<LI>

In many cases it's faster to access data from a database (using a live
connection) than accessing a text file, just because the database is
likely to be more compact than the text file (if you are using numerical
data), and this will involve fewer disk accesses.  You will also save
code because you don't have to parse your text files to find line and
column boundaries.
<LI>

You can also use replication to speed things up. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.
<LI>

Declaring a table with <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE=1</CODE> will make the updating of
indexes faster, as these are not logged to disk until the file is closed.
The downside is that you should run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on these tables before
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that they are okay if something killed
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> in the middle.  As the key information can always be generated
from the data, you should not lose anything by using <CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE>.

You can find a discussion about different locking methods in the appendix.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Locking_methods">E.4  Locking methods</A>.

</P>
<P>
All locking in MySQL is deadlock-free, except for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> type tables.
This is managed by always
requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning of a query and always
locking the tables in the same order.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> type tables automatically acquire their row locks and
<CODE>BDB</CODE> type tables
their page locks during the processing of SQL statements, not at the start
of the transaction.

</P>
<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no locks on the table, put a write lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the write lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
The locking method MySQL uses for <CODE>READ</CODE> locks works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If there are no write locks on the table, put a read lock on it.
<LI>

Otherwise, put the lock request in the read lock queue.
</UL>

<P>
When a lock is released, the lock is made available to the threads
in the write lock queue, then to the threads in the read lock queue.

</P>
<P>
This means that if you have many updates on a table, <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements will wait until there are no more updates.

</P>
<P>
To work around this for the case where you want to do many <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations on a table, you can insert rows in a temporary
table and update the real table with the records from the temporary table
once in a while.

</P>
<P>
This can be done with the following code:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES real_table WRITE, insert_table WRITE;
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO real_table SELECT * FROM insert_table;
mysql&#62; TRUNCATE TABLE insert_table;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> options with <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> if you want to prioritise retrieval in some specific
cases.  You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>
to get the same behaveour.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> can also help making table locks shorter.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You could also change the locking code in <TT>`mysys/thr_lock.c'</TT> to use a
single queue.  In this case, write locks and read locks would have the same
priority, which might help some applications.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_locking">5.3.2  Table Locking Issues</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX874"></A>

</P>
<P>
The table locking code in MySQL is deadlock free.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses table locking (instead of row locking or column
locking) on all table types, except <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables,
to achieve a very
high lock speed.  For large tables, table locking is much better than
row locking for most applications, but there are, of course, some
pitfalls.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, MySQL only uses table
locking if you explicitly lock the table with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.
For these table types we recommend you to not use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> at all, because <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> uses automatic
row level locking and <CODE>BDB</CODE> uses page level locking to
ensure transaction isolation.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.7 and above, you can insert rows into
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables at the same time other threads are reading from the
table.  Note that currently this only works if there are no holes after
deleted rows in the table at the time the insert is made. When all holes
has been filled with new data, concurrent inserts will automatically be
enabled again.

</P>
<P>
Table locking enables many threads to read from a table at the same
time, but if a thread wants to write to a table, it must first get
exclusive access.  During the update, all other threads that want to
access this particular table will wait until the update is ready.

</P>
<P>
As updates on tables normally are considered to be more important than
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, all statements that update a table have higher priority
than statements that retrieve information from a table. This should
ensure that updates are not 'starved' because one issues a lot of heavy
queries against a specific table. (You can change this by using
<CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> with the statement that does the update or
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> with the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.)

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL Version 3.23.7 one can use the
<CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE> variable to force MySQL to
temporary give all <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, that wait for a table, a
higher priority after a specific number of inserts on a table.

</P>
<P>
Table locking is, however, not very good under the following senario:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A client issues a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that takes a long time to run.
<LI>

Another client then issues an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> on a used table. This client
will wait until the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is finished.
<LI>

Another client issues another <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement on the same table. As
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> has higher priority than <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, this <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
will wait for the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> to finish.  It will also wait for the first
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> to finish!
<LI>

A thread is waiting for something like <CODE>full disk</CODE>, in which case all
threads that wants to access the problem table will also be put in a waiting
state until more disk space is made available.
</UL>

<P>
Some possible solutions to this problem are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Try to get the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements to run faster. You may have to create
some summary tables to do this.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE>.  This will give
all statements that update (modify) a table lower priority than a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement. In this case the last <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement in the previous
scenario would execute before the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement.

<LI>

You can give a specific <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
statement lower priority with the <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute.

<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a low value for <CODE>max_write_lock_count</CODE> to give
<CODE>READ</CODE> locks after a certain number of <CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks.

<LI>

You can specify that all updates from a specific thread should be done with
low priority by using the SQL command: <CODE>SET LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES=1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can specify that a specific <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is very important with the
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> attribute. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> combined with <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
switch to use the new <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as these support concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s.

<LI>

If you mainly mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> attribute to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> will probably solve your problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If you have problems with <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>
option to <CODE>DELETE</CODE> may help. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DELETE">6.4.6  <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX877"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL keeps row data and index data in separate files. Many (almost
all) other databases mix row and index data in the same file. We believe that
the MySQL choice is better for a very wide range of modern systems.

</P>
<P>
Another way to store the row data is to keep the information for each
column in a separate area (examples are SDBM and Focus). This will cause a
performance hit for every query that accesses more than one column. Because
this degenerates so quickly when more than one column is accessed,
we believe that this model is not good for general purpose databases.

</P>
<P>
The more common case is that the index and data are stored together
(like in Oracle/Sybase et al). In this case you will find the row
information at the leaf page of the index. The good thing with this
layout is that it, in many cases, depending on how well the index is
cached, saves a disk read.  The bad things with this layout are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Table scanning is much slower because you have to read through the indexes
to get at the data.
<LI>

You can't use only the index table to retrieve data for a query.
<LI>

You lose a lot of space, as you must duplicate indexes from the nodes
(as you can't store the row in the nodes).
<LI>

Deletes will degenerate the table over time (as indexes in nodes are
usually not updated on delete).
<LI>

It's harder to cache only the index data.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Data_size" HREF="manual_toc.html#Data_size">5.4.2  Get Your Data as Small as Possible</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
One of the most basic optimisation is to get your data (and indexes) to
take as little space on the disk (and in memory) as possible. This can
give huge improvements because disk reads are faster and normally less
main memory will be used. Indexing also takes less resources if
done on smaller columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports a lot of different table types and row formats.
Choosing the right table format may give you a big performance gain.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get better performance on a table and minimise storage space
using the techniques listed here:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use the most efficient (smallest) types possible. MySQL has
many specialised types that save disk space and memory.

<LI>

Use the smaller integer types if possible to get smaller tables. For
example, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE> is often better than <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<LI>

Declare columns to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> if possible. It makes everything
faster and you save one bit per column. Note that if you really need
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in your application you should definitely use it. Just avoid
having it on all columns by default.

<LI>

If you don't have any variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
<CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), a fixed-size record format is
used. This is faster but unfortunately may waste some space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A>.

<LI>

The primary index of a table should be as short as possible. This makes
identification of one row easy and efficient.

<LI>

For each table, you have to decide which storage/index method to
use. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

Only create the indexes that you really need. Indexes are good for
retrieval but bad when you need to store things fast. If you mostly
access a table by searching on a combination of columns, make an index
on them. The first index part should be the most used column. If you are
<STRONG>always</STRONG> using many columns, you should use the column with more duplicates
first to get better compression of the index.

<LI>

If it's very likely that a column has a unique prefix on the first number
of characters, it's better to only index this prefix. MySQL
supports an index on a part of a character column. Shorter indexes are
faster not only because they take less disk space but also because they
will give you more hits in the index cache and thus fewer disk
seeks. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

In some circumstances it can be beneficial to split into two a table that is
scanned very often. This is especially true if it is a dynamic
format table and it is possible to use a smaller static format table that
can be used to find the relevant rows when scanning the table.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="MySQL_indexes" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX883"></A>

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to find rows with a specific value of one column
fast. Without an index MySQL has to start with the first record
and then read through the whole table until it finds the relevant
rows. The bigger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index
for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly get a position to
seek to in the middle of the datafile without having to look at all the
data. If a table has 1000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than
reading sequentially. Note that if you need to access almost all 1000
rows it is faster to read sequentially because we then avoid disk seeks.

</P>
<P>
All MySQL indexes (<CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>, <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>, and
<CODE>INDEX</CODE>) are stored in B-trees. Strings are automatically prefix-
and end-space compressed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_INDEX">6.5.7  <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Indexes are used to:

<UL>
<LI>

Quickly find the rows that match a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Retrieve rows from other tables when performing joins.

<LI>

Find the <CODE>MAX()</CODE> or <CODE>MIN()</CODE> value for a specific indexed
column. This is optimised by a preprocessor that checks if you are
using <CODE>WHERE</CODE> key_part_# = constant on all key parts &#60; N.  In this case
MySQL will do a single key lookup and replace the <CODE>MIN()</CODE>
expression with a constant.  If all expressions are replaced with
constants, the query will return at once:


<PRE>
SELECT MIN(key_part2),MAX(key_part2) FROM table_name where key_part1=10
</PRE>

<LI>

Sort or group a table if the sorting or grouping is done on a leftmost
prefix of a usable key (for example, <CODE>ORDER BY
key_part_1,key_part_2 </CODE>). The key is read in reverse order if all key
parts are followed by <CODE>DESC</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#ORDER_BY_optimisation">5.2.7  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE></A>.

<LI>

In some cases a query can be optimised to retrieve values without
consulting the datafile. If all used columns for some table are numeric
and form a leftmost prefix for some key, the values may be retrieved
from the index tree for greater speed:


<PRE>
SELECT key_part3 FROM table_name WHERE key_part1=1
</PRE>

</UL>

<P>
Suppose you issue the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1 AND col2=val2;
</PRE>

<P>
If a multiple-column index exists on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the
appropriate rows can be fetched directly. If separate single-column
indexes exist on <CODE>col1</CODE> and <CODE>col2</CODE>, the optimiser tries to
find the most restrictive index by deciding which index will find fewer
rows and using that index to fetch the rows.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
If the table has a multiple-column index, any leftmost prefix of the
index can be used by the optimiser to find rows. For example, if you
have a three-column index on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, you have indexed
search capabilities on <CODE>(col1)</CODE>, <CODE>(col1,col2)</CODE>, and
<CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL can't use a partial index if the columns don't form a
leftmost prefix of the index.  Suppose you have the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col1=val1;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col2=val2 AND col3=val3;
</PRE>

<P>
If an index exists on <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>, only the first query
shown above uses the index. The second and third queries do involve
indexed columns, but <CODE>(col2)</CODE> and <CODE>(col2,col3)</CODE> are not
leftmost prefixes of <CODE>(col1,col2,col3)</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX886"></A>
<A NAME="IDX887"></A>
<A NAME="IDX888"></A>
<A NAME="IDX889"></A>
MySQL also uses indexes for <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons if the argument
to <CODE>LIKE</CODE> is a constant string that doesn't start with a wildcard
character.  For example, the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements use indexes:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "Patrick%";
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "Pat%_ck%";
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, only rows with <CODE>"Patrick" &#60;= key_col &#60;
"Patricl"</CODE> are considered.  In the second statement, only rows with
<CODE>"Pat" &#60;= key_col &#60; "Pau"</CODE> are considered.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements will not use indexes:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE "%Patrick%";
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col LIKE other_col;
</PRE>

<P>
In the first statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value begins with a wildcard
character.  In the second statement, the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> value is not a
constant.

</P>
<P>
MySQL 4.0 does another optimisation on <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.  If you use
<CODE>... LIKE "%string%"</CODE> and <CODE>string</CODE> is longer than 3 characters,
MySQL will use the <CODE>Turbo Boyer-Moore</CODE> algorithm to initialise the
pattern for the string and then use this pattern to perform the search
quicker.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX890"></A>
<A NAME="IDX891"></A>
Searching using <CODE>column_name IS NULL</CODE> will use indexes if column_name
is an index.

</P>
<P>
MySQL normally uses the index that finds the least number of rows. An
index is used for columns that you compare with the following operators:
<CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#62;=</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;=</CODE>, <CODE>BETWEEN</CODE>, and a
<CODE>LIKE</CODE> with a non-wildcard prefix like <CODE>'something%'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Any index that doesn't span all <CODE>AND</CODE> levels in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause
is not used to optimise the query. In other words:  To be able to use an
index, a prefix of the index must be used in every <CODE>AND</CODE> group.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part1=1 AND index_part2=2 AND other_column=3
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10 AND index=2      /* index = 1 OR index = 2 */
... WHERE index_part1='hello' AND index_part_3=5
          /* optimised like "index_part1='hello'" */
... WHERE index1=1 and index2=2 or index1=3 and index3=3;
          /* Can use index on index1 but not on index2 or index 3 */
</PRE>

<P>
These <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clauses do <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> use indexes:

<PRE>
... WHERE index_part2=1 AND index_part3=2  /* index_part_1 is not used */
... WHERE index=1 OR A=10                  /* Index is not used in
                                                        both AND parts */
... WHERE index_part1=1 OR index_part2=10  /* No index spans all rows  */
</PRE>

<P>
Note that in some cases MySQL will not use an index, even if one
would be available.  Some of the cases where this happens are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If the use of the index would require MySQL to access more
than 30% of the rows in the table.  (In this case a table scan is
probably much faster, as this will require us to do much fewer seeks.)
Note that if such a query uses <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> to only retrieve
part of the rows, MySQL will use an index anyway, as it can
much more quickly find the few rows to return in the result.
</UL>

All MySQL column types can be indexed.  Use of indexes on the
relevant columns is the best way to improve the performance of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
operations.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of keys and the maximum index length is defined per
storage engine. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>. You can with all storage engines have
at least 16 keys and a total index length of at least 256 bytes.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, you can index a prefix of a
column.  This is much faster and requires less disk space than indexing the
whole column.  The syntax to use in the <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement to
index a column prefix looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
KEY index_name (col_name(length))
</PRE>

<P>
The example here creates an index for the first 10 characters of the
<CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
    -&#62;        name CHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;        KEY index_name (name(10)));
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns, you must index a prefix of the
column.  You cannot index the entire column.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be
created only from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column and partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details.

MySQL can create indexes on multiple columns.  An index may
consist of up to 15 columns. (On <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns you
can also use a prefix of the column as a part of an index.)

</P>
<P>
A multiple-column index can be considered a sorted array containing values
that are created by concatenating the values of the indexed columns.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses multiple-column indexes in such a way that queries are
fast when you specify a known quantity for the first column of the index in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, even if you don't specify values for the other columns.

</P>
<P>
Suppose a table is created using the following specification:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (
    -&#62;       id INT NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       last_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       first_name CHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    -&#62;       PRIMARY KEY (id),
    -&#62;       INDEX name (last_name,first_name));
</PRE>

<P>
Then the index <CODE>name</CODE> is an index over <CODE>last_name</CODE> and
<CODE>first_name</CODE>.  The index will be used for queries that specify
values in a known range for <CODE>last_name</CODE>, or for both <CODE>last_name</CODE>
and <CODE>first_name</CODE>.
Therefore, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND (first_name="Michael" OR first_name="Monty");

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"
    -&#62;                    AND first_name &#62;="M" AND first_name &#60; "N";
</PRE>

<P>
However, the <CODE>name</CODE> index will NOT be used in the following queries:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE first_name="Michael";

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM test WHERE last_name="Widenius"

MySQL is multi-threaded, so it may have many queries on the same table

different states on the same file, the table is opened independently by
each concurrent thread. This takes some memory but will normaly increase
performance.  With <CODE>ISAM</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables this also requires
one extra file descriptor for the datafile. With these table types the index
file descriptor is shared between all threads.

increase one or both of these values, you may run up against a limit
imposed by your operating system on the per-process number of open file
descriptors.  However, you can increase the limit on many systems.
Consult your OS documentation to find out how to do this, because the
method for changing the limit varies widely from system to system.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>table_cache</CODE> is related to <CODE>max_connections</CODE>.  For example,
for 200 concurrent running connections, you should have a table cache of
at least <CODE>200 * n</CODE>, where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum number of tables
in a join.  You also need to reserve some extra file descriptors for
temporary tables and files.

</P>
<P>
Make sure that your operating system can handle the number of open file
descriptors implied by the <CODE>table_cache</CODE> setting.  If
<CODE>table_cache</CODE> is set too high, MySQL may run out of file
descriptors and refuse connections, fail to perform queries, and be very
unreliable.  You also have to take into account that the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage
engine needs two file descriptors for each unique open table. You can
in increase the number of file descriptors available for MySQL with
the <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> startup option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Not_enough_file_handles">A.2.16  File Not Found</A>.

</P>
<P>
The cache of open tables will be keept at a level of <CODE>table_cache</CODE>
entries (default 64; this can be changed with the <CODE>-O
table_cache=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>).  Note that in MySQL may
temporarly open even more tables to be able to execute queries.

</P>
<P>
A not used table is closed and removed from the table cache under the
following circumstances:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When the cache is full and a thread tries to open a table that is not in
the cache.
<LI>

When the cache contains more than <CODE>table_cache</CODE> entries and
a thread is no longer using a table.
<LI>

When someone executes <CODE>mysqladmin refresh</CODE> or
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE>.
<LI>

When someone executes a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> statement.
</UL>

<P>
When the table cache fills up, the server uses the following procedure
to locate a cache entry to use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Tables that are not currently in use are released, in least-recently-used
order.

<LI>

If the cache is full and no tables can be released, but a new table needs to
be opened, the cache is temporarily extended as necessary.

<LI>

If the cache is in a temporarily-extended state and a table goes from in-use
to not-in-use state, the table is closed and released from the cache.
</UL>

<P>
A table is opened for each concurrent access. This means that
if you have two threads accessing the same table or access the table
twice in the same query (with <CODE>AS</CODE>) the table needs to be opened twice.
The first open of any table takes two file descriptors; each additional
use of the table takes only one file descriptor.  The extra descriptor
for the first open is used for the index file; this descriptor is shared
among all threads.

</P>
<P>
If you are opening a table with the <CODE>HANDLER table_name OPEN</CODE>
statement, a dedicated table object is allocated for the thread.
This table object is not shared by other threads an will not be closed
until the thread calls <CODE>HANDLER table_name CLOSE</CODE> or the thread dies.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#HANDLER">6.4.2  <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> Syntax</A>.  When this happens, the table is put
back in the table cache (if it isn't full).

</P>
<P>
You can check if your table cache is too small by checking the <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
variable <CODE>Opened_tables</CODE>.  If this is quite big, even if you
haven't done a lot of <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>, you should increase your table
cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_STATUS">4.5.6.3  <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have many files in a directory, open, close, and create operations will
be slow.  If you execute <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements on many different tables,
there will be a little overhead when the table cache is full, because for
every table that has to be opened, another must be closed. You can reduce
this overhead by making the table cache larger.

We start with the system level things since some of these decisions have
to be made very early. In other cases a fast look at this part may
suffice because it not that important for the big gains. However, it is always
nice to have a feeling about how much one could gain by changing things
at this level.

</P>
<P>
The default OS to use is really important!  To get the most use of
multiple-CPU machines one should use Solaris (because the threads works
really nice) or Linux (because the 2.2 kernel has really good SMP
support). Also on 32-bit machines Linux has a 2G file-size limit by
default. Hopefully this will be fixed soon when new filesystems are
released (XFS/Reiserfs).  If you have a desperate need for files bigger
than 2G on Linux-intel 32 bit, you should get the LFS patch for the ext2
filesystem.

Because we have not run MySQL in production on that many platforms, we

Other tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have enough RAM, you could remove all swap devices. Some
operating systems will use a swap device in some contexts even if you
have free memory.
<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> MySQL option to avoid external
locking. Note that this will not impact MySQL's functionality as
long as you only run one server. Just remember to take down the server (or
lock relevant parts) before you run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. On some system
this switch is mandatory because the external locking does not work in any
case.

The <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option is on by default when compiling with
MIT-pthreads, because <CODE>flock()</CODE> isn't fully supported by
MIT-pthreads on all platforms.  It's also on default for Linux
as Linux file locking are not yet safe.

The only case when you can't use <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> is if you run
multiple MySQL <EM>servers</EM> (not clients) on the same data,
or run <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> on the table without first flushing and locking
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server tables first.

You can still use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>/<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> even if you
are using <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>

If there is a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server currently running, you can see what
values it actually is using for the variables by executing this command:

MySQL uses algorithms that are very scalable, so you can usually
run with very little memory. If you, however, give MySQL more
memory, you will normally also get better performance.

</P>
<P>
When tuning a MySQL server, the two most important variables to use
are <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE> and <CODE>table_cache</CODE>.  You should first feel
confident that you have these right before trying to change any of the
other variables.

</P>
<P>
If you have much memory (&#62;=256M) and many tables and want maximum performance
with a moderate number of clients, you should use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=64M -O table_cache=256 \
           -O sort_buffer=4M -O read_buffer_size=1M &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you have only 128M and only a few tables, but you still do a lot of
sorting, you can use something like:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=16M -O sort_buffer=1M
</PRE>

<P>
If you have little memory and lots of connections, use something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=100k \
           -O read_buffer_size=100k &#38;

<P>
or even:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=512k -O sort_buffer=16k \
           -O table_cache=32 -O read_buffer_size=8k -O net_buffer_length=1K &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
If you are doing a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on files that are
much bigger than your available memory you should increase the value of
<CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE> to speed up the reading of rows after the sorting
is done.

</P>
<P>
When you have installed MySQL, the <TT>`support-files'</TT> directory will
contain some different <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> example files, <TT>`my-huge.cnf'</TT>,
<TT>`my-large.cnf'</TT>, <TT>`my-medium.cnf'</TT>, and <TT>`my-small.cnf'</TT>, you can
use as a base to optimise your system.

</P>
<P>
If there are very many connections, ``swapping problems'' may occur unless
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> has been configured to use very little memory for each
connection. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> performs better if you have enough memory for all
connections, of course.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you change an option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, it remains in effect only
for that instance of the server.

<P>
To see the effects of a parameter change, do something like this:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqld -O key_buffer=32m --help

Most of the following tests are done on Linux with the

other operating systems and workloads.

You get the fastest executable when you link with <CODE>-static</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Linux, you will get the fastest code when compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>
and <CODE>-O3</CODE>. To compile <TT>`sql_yacc.cc'</TT> with these options, you
need about 200M memory because <CODE>gcc/pgcc</CODE> needs a lot of memory to
make all functions inline. You should also set <CODE>CXX=gcc</CODE> when
configuring MySQL to avoid inclusion of the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE>
library (it is not needed). Note that with some versions of <CODE>pgcc</CODE>,
the resulting code will only run on true Pentium processors, even if you
use the compiler option that you want the resulting code to be working on
all x586 type processors (like AMD).

</P>
<P>
By just using a better compiler and/or better compiler options you can
get a 10-30% speed increase in your application.  This is particularly
important if you compile the SQL server yourself!

We have tested both the Cygnus CodeFusion and Fujitsu compilers, but
when we tested them, neither was sufficiently bug free to allow
MySQL to be compiled with optimisations on.

When you compile MySQL you should only include support for the
character sets that you are going to use. (Option <CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE>.)
The standard MySQL binary distributions are compiled with support
for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of some measurements that we have done:

<UL>
<LI>

If you use <CODE>pgcc</CODE> and compile everything with <CODE>-O6</CODE>, the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is 1% faster than with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2.

<LI>

If you link dynamically (without <CODE>-static</CODE>), the result is 13%
slower on Linux.  Note that you still can use a dynamic linked
MySQL library. It is only the server that is critical for
performance.

<LI>

If you strip your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary with <CODE>strip libexec/mysqld</CODE>,
the resulting binary can be up to 4% faster.

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP rather than Unix sockets, the result is 7.5%
slower on the same computer. (If you are connection to <CODE>localhost</CODE>,
MySQL will, by default, use sockets.)

<LI>

If you connect using TCP/IP from another computer over a 100M Ethernet,
things will be 8-11% slower.

<LI>

When running our benchmark tests using secure connections (all data
encrypted with internal SSL support) things were 55% slower.

<LI>

If you compile with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, then you will lose 20%
for most queries, but some queries may take substantially longer (The
MySQL benchmarks ran 35% slower)
If you use <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, then you will only lose 15%.
By starting a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version compiled with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>
with <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> the end result should be close to when
configuring with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE>.

<LI>

On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, Forte 5.0 is 4% faster than <CODE>gcc</CODE> 3.2

<LI>

On a Sun UltraSPARC-IIe, Forte 5.0 is 4% faster in 32 bit mode than in
64 bit mode.

<LI>

Compiling with <CODE>gcc</CODE> 2.95.2 for UltraSPARC with the option
<CODE>-mcpu=v8 -Wa,-xarch=v8plusa</CODE> gives 4% more performance.

<LI>

On Solaris 2.5.1, MIT-pthreads is 8-12% slower than Solaris native
threads on a single processor. With more load/CPUs the difference should
get bigger.

<LI>

Running with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE> makes mysqld 1% slower.

<LI>

Compiling on Linux-x86 using gcc without frame pointers
<CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE> or <CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer -ffixed-ebp</CODE>
makes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> 1-4% faster.
</UL>

<P>
The MySQL-Linux distribution provided by MySQL AB used
to be compiled with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>, but we had to go back to regular gcc
because of a bug in <CODE>pgcc</CODE> that would generate the code that does
not run on AMD. We will continue using gcc until that bug is resolved.
In the meantime, if you have a non-AMD machine, you can get a faster
binary by compiling with <CODE>pgcc</CODE>.  The standard MySQL
Linux binary is linked statically to get it faster and more portable.

<H3><A NAME="Memory_use" HREF="manual_toc.html#Memory_use">5.5.4  How MySQL Uses Memory</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>

</P>
<P>
The following list indicates some of the ways that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server
uses memory.  Where applicable, the name of the server variable relevant
to the memory use is given:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The key buffer (variable <CODE>key_buffer_size</CODE>) is shared by all
threads; other buffers used by the server are allocated as
needed. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

<LI>

Each connection uses some thread-specific space: A stack (default 64K,
variable <CODE>thread_stack</CODE>), a connection buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>), and a result buffer (variable
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE>). The connection buffer and result buffer are
dynamically enlarged up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> when needed.  When
a query is running, a copy of the current query string is also allocated.

<LI>

All threads share the same base memory.

<LI>

Only the compressed <CODE>ISAM</CODE> / <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are memory mapped.  This
is because the 32-bit memory space of 4GB is not large enough for most
big tables. When systems with a 64-bit address space become more
common we may add general support for memory mapping.

<LI>

Each request doing a sequential scan over a table allocates a read buffer
(variable <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>).

<LI>

When reading rows in 'random' order (for example after a sort) a
random-read buffer is allocated to avoid disk seeks.
(variable <CODE>record_rnd_buffer</CODE>).

<LI>

All joins are done in one pass, and most joins can be done without even
using a temporary table. Most temporary tables are memory-based (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>)
tables.  Temporary tables with a big record length (calculated as the
sum of all column lengths) or that contain <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns are
stored on disk.

One problem in MySQL versions before Version 3.23.2 is that if a <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
table exceeds the size of <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>, you get the error <CODE>The
table tbl_name is full</CODE>. In newer versions this is handled by
automatically changing the in-memory (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>) table to a disk-based
(<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>) table as necessary. To work around this problem, you can
increase the temporary table size by setting the <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, or by setting the SQL option
<CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> in the client program.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>. In MySQL Version 3.20, the maximum size of the
temporary table was <CODE>record_buffer*16</CODE>, so if you are using this
version, you have to increase the value of <CODE>record_buffer</CODE>. You can
also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option to always
store temporary tables on disk. However, this will affect the speed of
many complicated queries.

<LI>

Most requests doing a sort allocates a sort buffer and 0-2 temporary
files depending on the result set size. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A>.

<LI>

Almost all parsing and calculating is done in a local memory store. No
memory overhead is needed for small items and the normal slow memory
allocation and freeing is avoided. Memory is allocated only for
unexpectedly large strings (this is done with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and
<CODE>free()</CODE>).

<LI>

Each index file is opened once and the datafile is opened once for each
concurrently running thread. For each concurrent thread, a table structure,
column structures for each column, and a buffer of size <CODE>3 * n</CODE> is
allocated (where <CODE>n</CODE> is the maximum row length, not counting <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
columns). A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> uses 5 to 8 bytes plus the length of the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>
data. The <CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> storage engines will use one extra row
buffer for internal usage.

<LI>

For each table having <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, a buffer is enlarged dynamically
to read in larger <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values. If you scan a table, a buffer as large
as the largest <CODE>BLOB</CODE> value is allocated.

<LI>

Storage engines for all in-use tables are saved in a cache and managed as a
FIFO. Normally the cache has 64 entries. If a table has been used by two
running threads at the same time, the cache contains two entries for the
table. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_cache">5.4.7  How MySQL Opens and Closes Tables</A>.

<LI>

A <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> command closes all tables that are not in
use and marks all in-use tables to be closed when the currently executing
thread finishes. This will effectively free most in-use memory.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>ps</CODE> and other system status programs may report that <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
uses a lot of memory. This may be caused by thread-stacks on different
memory addresses. For example, the Solaris version of <CODE>ps</CODE> counts
the unused memory between stacks as used memory. You can verify this by
checking available swap with <CODE>swap -s</CODE>. We have tested
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with commercial memory-leakage detectors, so there should
be no memory leaks.

When a new thread connects to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will span a
new thread to handle the request.  This thread will first check if the
hostname is in the hostname cache. If not the thread will call
<CODE>gethostbyaddr_r()</CODE> and <CODE>gethostbyname_r()</CODE> to resolve the
hostname.

</P>
<P>
If the operating system doesn't support the above thread-safe calls, the
thread will lock a mutex and call <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> and
<CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> instead. Note that in this case no other thread
can resolve other hostnames that is not in the hostname cache until the
first thread is ready.

</P>

You can disable DNS host lookup by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE>.  In this case you can however only use IP
names in the MySQL privilege tables.

<P>
If you have a very slow DNS and many hosts, you can get more performance by
either disabling DNS lookop with <CODE>--skip-name-resolve</CODE> or by

<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>

You can disable the hostname cache with <CODE>--skip-host-cache</CODE>. You
can clear the hostname cache with <CODE>FLUSH HOSTS</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin
flush-hosts</CODE>.

If you don't want to allow connections over <CODE>TCP/IP</CODE>, you can do this

The following examples shows the different syntaxes one can use to set
variables:

</P>
<P>
In old MySQL versions we allowed the use of the <CODE>SET OPTION</CODE> syntax,
but this syntax is now deprecated.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0.3 we added the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> and <CODE>SESSION</CODE> options
and access to most important startup variables.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> can be used as a synonym for <CODE>SESSION</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you set several variables on the same command line, the last used
<CODE>GLOBAL | SESSION</CODE> mode is used.

</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>@@variable_name</CODE> syntax is supported to make MySQL syntax
compatible with some other databases.

</P>
<P>
The different system variables one can set are described in the system
variable section of this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#System_Variables">6.1.5  System Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>SESSION</CODE> (the default) the option you set remains
in effect until the current session ends, or until you set the option to
a different value. If you use <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE>, which require the
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege, the option is remembered and used for new
connections until the server restarts. If you want to make an option
permanent, you should set it in one of the MySQL option
files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
To avoid wrong usage MySQL will give an error if you use <CODE>SET
GLOBAL</CODE> with a variable that can only be used with <CODE>SET SESSION</CODE> or if
you are not using <CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> with a global variable.

</P>
<P>
If you want to set a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable to the <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> value or a
<CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> value to the MySQL default value, you can set it to
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
SET max_join_size=DEFAULT;
</PRE>

<P>
This is identical to:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @@session.max_join_size=@@global.max_join_size;
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to restrict the maximum value a startup option can be set to
with the <CODE>SET</CODE> command, you can specify this by using the
<CODE>--maximum-variable-name</CODE> command line option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get a list of most variables with <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.  You can get the value for a specific value with
the <CODE>@@[global.|local.]variable_name</CODE> syntax:

SHOW VARIABLES like "max_join_size";
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES like "max_join_size";
SELECT @@max_join_size, @@global.max_join_size;

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CHARACTER SET character_set_name | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
This maps all strings from and to the client with the given mapping.
Currently the only option for <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> is
<CODE>cp1251_koi8</CODE>, but you can easily add new mappings by editing the
<TT>`sql/convert.cc'</TT> file in the MySQL source distribution.  The
default mapping can be restored by using a <CODE>character_set_name</CODE> value of
<CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

Note that the syntax for setting the <CODE>CHARACTER SET</CODE> option differs
from the syntax for setting the other options.

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX925"></A>
Set the password for the current user. Any non-anonymous user can change his
own password!

<DT><CODE>PASSWORD FOR user = PASSWORD('some password')</CODE>
<DD>
Set the password for a specific user on the current server host. Only a user
with access to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database can do this.  The user should be
given in <CODE>user@hostname</CODE> format, where <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>hostname</CODE>
are exactly as they are listed in the <CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> columns of
the <CODE>mysql.user</CODE> table entry.  For example, if you had an entry with
<CODE>User</CODE> and <CODE>Host</CODE> fields of <CODE>'bob'</CODE> and <CODE>'%.loc.gov'</CODE>,
you would write:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SET PASSWORD FOR bob@"%.loc.gov" = PASSWORD("newpass");
</PRE>

Which is equivalent to:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD("newpass")
    -&#62;                   WHERE user="bob" AND host="%.loc.gov";
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> (default) then one can find the last inserted row
for a table with an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with the following construct:
<CODE>WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL</CODE>.  This is used by some
ODBC programs like Access.

<DT><CODE>AUTOCOMMIT= 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE> all changes to a table will be done at once. To start
a multi-command transaction, you have to use the <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>
statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>. If set to <CODE>0</CODE> you have to use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> /
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to accept/revoke that transaction. See section <A HREF="manual.html#COMMIT">6.7.1  <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK</CODE> Syntax</A>.  Note
that when you change from not <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode to
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, MySQL will do an automatic
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> on any open transactions.

<DT><CODE>BIG_TABLES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX926"></A>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all temporary tables are stored on disk rather than in
memory.  This will be a little slower, but you will not get the error
<CODE>The table tbl_name is full</CODE> for big <CODE>SELECT</CODE> operations that
require a large temporary table.  The default value for a new connection is
<CODE>0</CODE> (that is, use in-memory temporary tables).
This option was before named <CODE>SQL_BIG_TABLES</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, MySQL will abort if a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> is attempted
that probably will take a very long time. This is useful when an inadvisable
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement has been issued. A big query is defined as a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> that probably will have to examine more than
<CODE>max_join_size</CODE> rows.  The default value for a new connection is
<CODE>1</CODE> (which will allow all <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements).

<DT><CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> will force the result from <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s
to be put into a temporary table. This will help MySQL free the
table locks early and will help in cases where it takes a long time to
send the result set to the client.

<DT><CODE>LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, all <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and
<CODE>LOCK TABLE WRITE</CODE> statements wait until there is no pending
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>LOCK TABLE READ</CODE> on the affected table.
This option was before named <CODE>SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>MAX_JOIN_SIZE = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Don't allow <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s that will probably need to examine more than
<CODE>value</CODE> row combinations.  By setting this value, you can catch
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>s where keys are not used properly and that would probably
take a long time. Setting this to a value other than <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> will reset
the <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE> flag.  If you set the <CODE>SQL_BIG_SELECTS</CODE>
flag again, the <CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE> variable will be ignored.
You can set a default value for this variable by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O max_join_size=#</CODE>.
This option was before named <CODE>SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE</CODE>.

Note that if the result of the query is already in the query cache, the
above check will not be made. Instead, MySQL will send the result to the
client. Since the query result is already computed and it will not burden
the server to send the result to the client.

<DT><CODE>QUERY_CACHE_TYPE = OFF | ON | DEMAND</CODE>

</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, MySQL will abort if an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> or
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is attempted that doesn't use a key or <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> in the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause. This makes it possible to catch wrong updates
when creating SQL commands by hand.

<DT><CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT = value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of records to return from <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  If
a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> has a <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause, the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes precedence
over the value of <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE>.  The default value for a new
connection is ``unlimited.'' If you have changed the limit, the default value
can be restored by using a <CODE>SQL_SELECT_LIMIT</CODE> value of <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_OFF = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, no logging will be done to the standard log for this
client, if the client has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.  This does not
affect the update log!

<DT><CODE>SQL_LOG_UPDATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>0</CODE>, no logging will be done to the update log for the client,
if the client has the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.  This does not affect the
standard log!

<DT><CODE>SQL_QUOTE_SHOW_CREATE = 0 | 1</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <CODE>1</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> will quote
table and column names. This is <STRONG>on</STRONG> by default,
for replication of tables with fancy column names to work.
section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_CREATE_TABLE">4.5.6.8  <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP = timestamp_value | DEFAULT</CODE>
<DD>
Set the time for this client.  This is used to get the original timestamp if
you use the update log to restore rows.  <CODE>timestamp_value</CODE> should be a
Unix epoch timestamp, not a MySQL timestamp.

<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be returned from <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>. This is stored in
the update log when you use <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> in a command that updates
a table.

<DT><CODE>INSERT_ID = #</CODE>
<DD>
Set the value to be used by the following <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
command when inserting an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value.  This is mainly used
with the update log.

<P>

<A NAME="IDX928"></A>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As mentioned before, disks seeks are a big performance bottleneck. This
problems gets more and more apparent when the data starts to grow so
large that effective caching becomes impossible. For large databases,
where you access data more or less randomly, you can be sure that you
will need at least one disk seek to read and a couple of disk seeks to
write things. To minimise this problem, use disks with low seek times.

<LI>

Increase the number of available disk spindles (and thereby reduce
the seek overhead) by either symlink files to different disks or striping
the disks.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Using symbolic links</STRONG>
<DD>
This means that you symlink the index and/or datafile(s) from the
normal data directory to another disk (that may also be striped). This
makes both the seek and read times better (if the disks are not used for
other things). See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links">5.6.1  Using Symbolic Links</A>.

<A NAME="IDX929"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Striping</STRONG>
<DD>
Striping means that you have many disks and put the first block on the
first disk, the second block on the second disk, and the Nth on the
(N mod number_of_disks) disk, and so on. This means if your normal data
size is less than the stripe size (or perfectly aligned) you will get
much better performance. Note that striping is very dependent on the OS
and stripe-size. So benchmark your application with different
stripe-sizes. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Custom_Benchmarks">5.1.5  Using Your Own Benchmarks</A>.

Note that the speed difference for striping is <STRONG>very</STRONG> dependent
on the parameters. Depending on how you set the striping parameters and
number of disks you may get a difference in orders of magnitude. Note that
you have to choose to optimise for random or sequential access.
</DL>

<LI>

For reliability you may want to use RAID 0+1 (striping + mirroring), but
in this case you will need 2*N drives to hold N drives of data. This is
probably the best option if you have the money for it!  You may, however,
also have to invest in some volume-management software to handle it
efficiently.

<LI>

A good option is to have semi-important data (that can be regenerated)
on RAID 0 disk while storing really important data (like host information
and logs) on a RAID 0+1 or RAID N disk. RAID N can be a problem if you
have many writes because of the time to update the parity bits.

<LI>

You may also set the parameters for the filesystem that the database
uses. One easy change is to mount the filesystem with the noatime
option. That makes it skip the updating of the last access time in the
inode and by this will avoid some disk seeks.

<LI>

On Linux, you can get much more performance (up to 100% under load is
not uncommon) by using <CODE>hdparm</CODE> to configure your disk's interface!  The
following should be quite good <CODE>hdparm</CODE> options for MySQL (and
probably many other applications):


<PRE>
hdparm -m 16 -d 1
</PRE>

Note that the performance/reliability when using the above depends on
your hardware, so we strongly suggest that you test your system
thoroughly after using <CODE>hdparm</CODE>!  Please consult the <CODE>hdparm</CODE>
man page for more information!  If <CODE>hdparm</CODE> is not used wisely,
filesystem corruption may result.  Backup everything before experimenting!

<LI>

On many operating systems you can mount the disks with the <CODE>-o async</CODE>
option to set the filesystem to be updated asynchronously.  If your computer is
reasonably stable, this should give you more performance without sacrificing
too much reliability.  (This flag is on by default on Linux.)

<LI>

If you don't need to know when a file was last accessed (which is not
really useful on a database server), you can mount your filesystems
with the <CODE>-o noatime</CODE> option.

You can move tables and databases from the database directory to other
locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations.
You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file
system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by
spreading your tables to different disk.

</P>
<P>
The recommended way to do this, is to just symlink databases to a
different disk and only symlink tables as a last resort.

</P>

<P>
The way to symlink a database is to first create a directory on some
disk where you have free space and then create a symlink to it from
the MySQL database directory.

shell&#62; mkdir /dr1/databases/test
shell&#62; ln -s /dr1/databases/test mysqld-datadir

<P>
MySQL doesn't support that you link one directory to multiple
databases.  Replacing a database directory with a symbolic link will
work fine as long as you don't make a symbolic link between databases.
Suppose you have a database <CODE>db1</CODE> under the MySQL data
directory, and then make a symlink <CODE>db2</CODE> that points to <CODE>db1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /path/to/datadir
shell&#62; ln -s db1 db2
</PRE>

<P>
Now, for any table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db1</CODE>, there also appears to be
a table <CODE>tbl_a</CODE> in <CODE>db2</CODE>.  If one thread updates <CODE>db1.tbl_a</CODE>
and another thread updates <CODE>db2.tbl_a</CODE>, there will be problems.

</P>
<P>
If you really need this, you must change the following code in
<TT>`mysys/mf_format.c'</TT>:

On Windows you can use internal symbolic links to directories by compiling
MySQL with <CODE>-DUSE_SYMDIR</CODE>. This allows you to put different

<A NAME="IDX933"></A>

</P>
<P>
Before MySQL 4.0 you should not symlink tables, if you are not
very careful with them. The problem is that if you run <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> on a symlinked
table, the symlinks will be removed and replaced by the original
files. This happens because the above command works by creating a
temporary file in the database directory and when the command is
complete, replace the original file with the temporary file.

</P>
<P>
You should not symlink tables on systems that don't have a fully
working <CODE>realpath()</CODE> call. (At least Linux and Solaris support
<CODE>realpath()</CODE>)

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.0 symlinks are fully supported only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  For other table types you will probably get strange problems
when doing any of the above mentioned commands.

</P>
<P>
The handling of symbolic links in MySQL 4.0 works the following
way (this is mostly relevant only for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables).

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

In the data directory you will always have the table definition file
and the data and index files.

<LI>

You can symlink the index file and the data file to different directories
independently of the other.

<LI>

The symlinking can be done from the operating system (if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is
not running) or with the <CODE>INDEX/DATA DIRECTORY="path-to-dir"</CODE> command
in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will not replace a symlink with the data or index file but
work directly on the file the symlink points to. Any temporary files
will be created in the same directory where the data or index file is
located.

<LI>

When you drop a table that is using symlinks, both the symlink and the
file the symlink points to are dropped.  This is a good reason to why you
should <STRONG>not</STRONG> run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as <CODE>root</CODE> or allow
persons to have write access to the MySQL database directories.

<LI>

If you rename a table with <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> and you don't move
the table to another database, the symlinks in the database directory
will be renamed to the new names and the data and index files will be
renamed accordingly.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE RENAME</CODE> to move a table to another database,
the table will be moved to the other database directory and the old
symlinks and the files they pointed to will be deleted.  (In other words,
the new table will not be symlinked.)

<LI>

If you are not using symlinks, you should use the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE>
option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to ensure that no one can drop or rename a file
outside of the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> data directory.

There are several ways to include quotes within a string:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <SAMP>`''</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`''</SAMP> may be written as <SAMP>`'''</SAMP>.

<LI>

A <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> may be written as <SAMP>`""'</SAMP>.

<LI>

You can precede the quote character with an escape character (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).

<LI>

A <SAMP>`''</SAMP> inside a string quoted with <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> needs no special treatment
and need not be doubled or escaped.  In the same way, <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> inside a
string quoted with <SAMP>`''</SAMP> needs no special treatment.
</UL>

<P>
The <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements shown here demonstrate how quoting and
escaping work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'hello', '"hello"', '""hello""', 'hel''lo', '\'hello';
+-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------+

mysql&#62; SELECT "hello", "'hello'", "''hello''", "hel""lo", "\"hello";

If you want to insert binary data into a string column (such as a
<CODE>BLOB</CODE>), the following characters must be represented by escape
sequences:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>NUL</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 0. You should represent this by <SAMP>`\0'</SAMP> (a backslash and an ASCII <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> character).
<DT><CODE>\</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 92, backslash.  Represent this by <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>'</CODE>
<DD>
ASCII 39, single quote.  Represent this by <SAMP>`\''</SAMP>.
<DT><CODE>"</CODE>

If you write C code, you can use the C API function
<CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> to escape characters for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_API_function_overview">8.4.2  C API Function Overview</A>.  In Perl, you can use the
<CODE>quote</CODE> method of the <CODE>DBI</CODE> package to convert special
characters to the proper escape sequences.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Perl_DBI_Class">8.2.2  The <CODE>DBI</CODE> Interface</A>.

</P>
<P>
You should use an escape function on any string that might contain any of the
special characters listed above!

</P>
<P>
Alternatively, many MySQL APIs provide some sort of placeholder capability
that allows you to insert special markers into a query string, and then bind
data values to them when you issue the query.  In this case, the API takes
case of escaping special characters in the values for you automatically.

MySQL supports hexadecimal values.  In numeric context these act
like an integer (64-bit precision). In string context these act like a binary
string where each pair of hex digits is converted to a character:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT x'4D7953514C';

</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>x'hexstring'</CODE> syntax (new in 4.0) is based on ANSI SQL and the
<CODE>0x</CODE> syntax is based on ODBC.  Hexadecimal strings are often used by
ODBC to supply values for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns.
You can convert a string or a number to hexadecimal with the <CODE>HEX()</CODE>
function.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL versions prior to 3.23.6, the name rules are as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A name may consist of alphanumeric characters from the current character set
and also <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>. The default character set is ISO-8859-1
Latin1; this may be changed with the <CODE>--default-character-set</CODE> option
to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

A name may start with any character that is legal in a name.  In particular,
a name may start with a digit (this differs from many other database
systems!).  However, a name cannot consist <EM>only</EM> of digits.

<LI>

You cannot use the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character in names because it is used to extend the
format by which you can refer to columns (see immediately below).
</UL>

<P>
It is recommended that you do not use names like <CODE>1e</CODE>, because
an expression like <CODE>1e+1</CODE> is ambiguous. It may be interpreted as the
expression <CODE>1e + 1</CODE> or as the number <CODE>1e+1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL you can refer to a column using any of the following forms:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column reference</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE>
from whichever table used in the query contains a column of that name.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the current database.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE> </TD><TD> Column <CODE>col_name</CODE> from table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> of the database <CODE>db_name</CODE>.  This form is available in
MySQL Version 3.22 or later.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<CODE>`column_name`</CODE> </TD><TD> A column that is a keyword or contains special characters.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for
a column reference in a statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.
For example, suppose tables <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE> each contain a column
<CODE>c</CODE>, and you retrieve <CODE>c</CODE> in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement that uses
both <CODE>t1</CODE> and <CODE>t2</CODE>.  In this case, <CODE>c</CODE> is ambiguous because it
is not unique among the tables used in the statement, so you must indicate
which table you mean by writing <CODE>t1.c</CODE> or <CODE>t2.c</CODE>.  Similarly, if
you are retrieving from a table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db1</CODE> and from a
table <CODE>t</CODE> in database <CODE>db2</CODE>, you must refer to columns in those
tables as <CODE>db1.t.col_name</CODE> and <CODE>db2.t.col_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX987"></A>
<A NAME="IDX988"></A>
The syntax <CODE>.tbl_name</CODE> means the table <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in the current
database.  This syntax is accepted for ODBC compatibility, because some ODBC
programs prefix table names with a <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character.

</P>

</P>
<P>
In MySQL, databases and tables correspond to directories and files
within those directories.  Consequently, the case-sensitivity of the
underlying operating system determines the case-sensitivity of database and
table names.  This means database and table names are case-insensitive in
Windows, and case-sensitive in most varieties of Unix. One prominent
exception here is Mac OS X, when the default HFS+ file system is being used.
However Mac OS X also supports UFS volumes, those are case sensitive on Mac
OS X just like they are on any Unix.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Extensions_to_ANSI">1.7.3  MySQL Extensions to ANSI SQL92</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: although database and table names are case-insensitive for
Windows, you should not refer to a given database or table using different
cases within the same query.  The following query would not work because it
refers to a table both as <CODE>my_table</CODE> and as <CODE>MY_TABLE</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE MY_TABLE.col=1;
</PRE>

<P>
Column names and column aliases are case-insensitive in all cases.

</P>
<P>
Aliases on tables are case-sensitive.  The following query would not work
because it refers to the alias both as <CODE>a</CODE> and as <CODE>A</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name AS a
    -&#62;                 WHERE a.col_name = 1 OR A.col_name = 2;
</PRE>

<P>
If you have trouble remembering the lettercase for database and table names,
adopt a consistent convention, such as always creating databases and
tables using lowercase names.

</P>
<P>
One way to avoid this problem is to start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>-O
lower_case_table_names=1</CODE>. By default this option is 1 on Windows and 0 on
Unix.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE> is 1 MySQL will convert all
table names to lowercase on storage and lookup.
(From version 4.0.2, this option also applies to database names.)
Note that if you change this option, you need to first convert your old
table names to lower case before starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you move <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> files from a Windows to a Unix disk, you may
in some cases need to use the <TT>`mysql_fix_extensions'</TT> tool to fix-up
the case of the file extensions in each specified database directory
(lowercase <TT>`.frm'</TT>, uppercase <TT>`.MYI'</TT> and <TT>`.MYD'</TT>).
<TT>`mysql_fix_extensions'</TT> can be found in the <TT>`scripts'</TT> subdirectory.

MySQL supports connection-specific user variables with the
<CODE>@variablename</CODE> syntax.  A variable name may consist of
alphanumeric characters from the current character set and also
<SAMP>`_'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> . The default character set is
ISO-8859-1 Latin1; this may be changed with the
<CODE>--default-character-set</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

</P>
<P>
Variables don't have to be initialised.  They contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> by default
and can store an integer, real, or string value.  All variables for
a thread are automatically freed when the thread exits.

</P>
<P>
You can set a variable with the <CODE>SET</CODE> syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
SET @variable= { integer expression | real expression | string expression }
[,@variable= ...].
</PRE>

<P>
You can also assign a value to a variable in statements other than <CODE>SET</CODE>.
However, in this case the assignment operator is <CODE>:=</CODE> rather than
<CODE>=</CODE>, because <CODE>=</CODE> is reserved for comparisons in non-<CODE>SET</CODE>
statements:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4,@t1,@t2,@t3;
+----------------------+------+------+------+
| @t1:=(@t2:=1)+@t3:=4 | @t1  | @t2  | @t3  |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
|                    5 |    5 |    1 |    4 |
+----------------------+------+------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
User variables may be used where expressions are allowed.  Note that
this does not currently include contexts where a number is explicitly
required, such as in the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement,
or the <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> clause of a <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement, each expression is evaluated
only when it's sent to the client.  This means that in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE>,
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause, you can't refer to an expression
that involves variables that are set in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. For example,
the following statement will NOT work as expected:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT (@aa:=id) AS a, (@aa+3) AS b FROM table_name HAVING b=5;
</PRE>

<P>
The reason is that <CODE>@aa</CODE> will not contain the value of the current
row, but the value of <CODE>id</CODE> for the previous accepted row.

</P>
<P>
The rule is to never assign <STRONG>and</STRONG> use the same variable in the same
statement.

</P>
<P>
Starting from MySQL 4.0.3 we provide better access to a lot of system
and connection variables. One can change most of them without having to take
down the server.

</P>
<P>
There are two kind of system variables: Thread-specific (or
connection-specific)
variables that are unique to the current connection and global variables
that are used to configure global events.
Global variables also are used to set up the initial values of the
corresponding thread-specific variables for new connections.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts, all global variables are initialised from command
line arguments and option files.  You can change the value with the
<CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> command. When a new thread is created, the thread-specific
variables are initialised from the global variables and they
will not change even if you issue a new <CODE>SET GLOBAL</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
To set the value for a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> variable, you should use one
of the following syntaxes:
(Here we use <CODE>sort_buffer_size</CODE> as an example variable)

</P>

<PRE>
SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size=value;
SET @@global.sort_buffer_size=value;
</PRE>

<P>
To set the value for a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable, you can use one of the
following syntaxes:

</P>

<PRE>
SET SESSION sort_buffer_size=value;
SET @@session.sort_buffer_size=value;
SET sort_buffer_size=value;
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't specify <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or <CODE>SESSION</CODE> then <CODE>SESSION</CODE>
is used. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>SESSION</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To retrieve the value for a <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> variable you can use one of the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT @@global.sort_buffer_size;
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
</PRE>

<P>
To retrieve the value for a <CODE>SESSION</CODE> variable you can use one of the
following commands:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT @@session.sort_buffer_size;
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES like 'sort_buffer_size';
</PRE>

<P>
When you <STRONG>retrieve</STRONG> a variable value with the
<CODE>@@variable_name</CODE> syntax and you don't specify <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or
<CODE>SESSION</CODE> then MySQL will return the thread-specific
(<CODE>SESSION</CODE>) value if it exists.  If not, MySQL will return the
global value.

</P>
<P>
The reason for requiring <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> for setting <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> only
variables but not for retrieving them is to ensure that we don't later
run into problems if we later would introduce a thread-specific variable
with the same name or remove a thread-specific variable.  In this case,
you could accidentally change the state for the server as a whole, rather than
just for your own connection.

</P>

and if you can use <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE> or <CODE>SESSION</CODE> with them.

normally be set to one of the available values for the variable, but can
also be set to the number that correspond to the enum value. (The first
enum value is 0).

<P>
The MySQL server supports the <CODE># to end of line</CODE>, <CODE>--
to end of line</CODE> and <CODE>/* in-line or multiple-line */</CODE> comment
styles:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
mysql&#62; SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+
/*
this is a
multiple-line comment
*/
1;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>--</CODE> (double-dash) comment style requires you to have at
least one space after the second dash!

</P>
<P>
Although the server understands the comment syntax just described,
there are some limitations on the way that the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client
parses <CODE>/* ... */</CODE> comments:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Single-quote and double-quote characters are taken to indicate the beginning
of a quoted string, even within a comment.  If the quote is not matched by a
second quote within the comment, the parser doesn't realise the comment has
ended.  If you are running <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively, you can tell that it
has gotten confused like this because the prompt changes from <CODE>mysql&#62;</CODE>
to <CODE>'&#62;</CODE> or <CODE>"&#62;</CODE>.

<LI>

A semicolon is taken to indicate the end of the current SQL statement
and anything following it to indicate the beginning of the next statement.
</UL>

<P>
These limitations apply both when you run <CODE>mysql</CODE> interactively
and when you put commands in a file and tell <CODE>mysql</CODE> to read its
input from that file with <CODE>mysql &#60; some-file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL supports the <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> ANSI SQL comment style only if the second dash
is followed by a space. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_comments">1.7.4.7  <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> as the Start of a Comment</A>.

</P>

<P>
A common problem stems from trying to create a table with column names that
use the names of datatypes or functions built into MySQL, such as
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE>.  You're allowed to do it (for example,
<CODE>ABS</CODE> is an allowed column name), but whitespace is not allowed between
a function name and the immediately following <SAMP>`('</SAMP> when using functions
whose names are also column names.

</P>
<P>
The following words are explicitly reserved in MySQL. Most of
them are forbidden by ANSI SQL92 as column and/or table names
(for example, <CODE>GROUP</CODE>).
A few are reserved because MySQL needs them and is
(currently) using a <CODE>yacc</CODE> parser:

MySQL supports a number of column types, which may be grouped into
three categories: numeric types, date and time types, and string (character)
types.  This section first gives an overview of the types available and
summarises the storage requirements for each column type, then provides a
more detailed description of the properties of the types in each category.
The overview is intentionally brief.  The more detailed descriptions should
be consulted for additional information about particular column types, such
as the allowable formats in which you can specify values.

</P>
<P>
The column types supported by MySQL are listed below.
The following code letters are used in the descriptions:

<DD>
Indicates the maximum display size.  The maximum legal display size is 255.

<DT><CODE>D</CODE>
<DD>
Applies to floating-point types and indicates the number of digits
following the decimal point.  The maximum possible value is 30, but
should be no greater than <CODE>M</CODE>-2.
</DL>

Square brackets (<SAMP>`['</SAMP> and <SAMP>`]'</SAMP>) indicate parts of type specifiers

Note that if you specify <CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE> for a column, MySQL will
automatically add the <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> attribute to the column.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: you should be aware that when you use subtraction
between integer values where one is of type <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the result
will be unsigned! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TINYINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1013"></A>
 

A very small integer. The signed range is <CODE>-128</CODE> to <CODE>127</CODE>. The
unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1014"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1015"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIT</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>BOOL</CODE>
<DD>
These are synonyms for <CODE>TINYINT(1)</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1016"></A>
<DT><CODE>SMALLINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A small integer. The signed range is <CODE>-32768</CODE> to <CODE>32767</CODE>. The
unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>65535</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1017"></A>
<DT><CODE>MEDIUMINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A medium-size integer. The signed range is <CODE>-8388608</CODE> to
<CODE>8388607</CODE>. The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>16777215</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1018"></A>
<DT><CODE>INT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A normal-size integer. The signed range is <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> to
<CODE>2147483647</CODE>.  The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>4294967295</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1019"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTEGER[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
This is a synonym for <CODE>INT</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1020"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGINT[(M)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A large integer. The signed range is <CODE>-9223372036854775808</CODE> to
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>. The unsigned range is <CODE>0</CODE> to
<CODE>18446744073709551615</CODE>.

Some things you should be aware of with respect to <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> columns:


<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1021"></A>
All arithmetic is done using signed <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
values, so you shouldn't use unsigned big integers larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE> (63 bits) except with bit functions! If you
do that, some of the last digits in the result may be wrong because of
rounding errors when converting the <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>.

MySQL 4.0 can handle <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> in the following cases:

<UL>
<LI>

Use integers to store big unsigned values in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column.
<LI>

In <CODE>MIN(big_int_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(big_int_column)</CODE>.
<LI>

When using operators (<CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>*</CODE>, etc.) where
both operands are integers.
</UL>

<LI>

You can always store an exact integer value in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column by
storing it as a string.  In this case, MySQL will perform a string-to-number
conversion that involves no intermediate double representation.
<LI>

<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> will use <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> arithmetic when
both arguments are integer values!  This means that if you
multiply two big integers (or results from functions that return
integers) you may get unexpected results when the result is larger than
<CODE>9223372036854775807</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>FLOAT(precision) [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A floating-point number.  <CODE>precision</CODE> can be
<CODE>&#60;=24</CODE> for a single-precision floating-point number and between 25
and 53 for a double-precision floating-point number. These types are like
the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types described immediately below.
<CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> has the same range as the corresponding <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> and
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> types, but the display size and number of decimals are undefined.

In MySQL Version 3.23, this is a true floating-point value.  In
earlier MySQL versions, <CODE>FLOAT(precision)</CODE> always has 2 decimals.

Note that using <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> may give you some unexpected problems as
all calculations in MySQL are done with double precision.

<DT><CODE>FLOAT[(M,D)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A small (single-precision) floating-point number.  Allowable values are
<CODE>-3.402823466E+38</CODE> to <CODE>-1.175494351E-38</CODE>, <CODE>0</CODE>,
and <CODE>1.175494351E-38</CODE> to <CODE>3.402823466E+38</CODE>.  If
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> is specified, negative values are disallowed.  The <CODE>M</CODE>
is the display width and <CODE>D</CODE> is the number of decimals.  <CODE>FLOAT</CODE>
without arguments or <CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> where <CODE>X</CODE> &#60;= 24 stands for a
single-precision floating-point number.

<A NAME="IDX1030"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOUBLE[(M,D)] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
A normal-size (double-precision) floating-point number.
Allowable values are <CODE>-1.7976931348623157E+308</CODE> to
<CODE>-2.2250738585072014E-308</CODE>, <CODE>0</CODE>, and

<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> is specified, negative values are disallowed.  The
<CODE>M</CODE> is the display width and <CODE>D</CODE> is the number of decimals.
<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> without arguments or <CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> where 25 &#60;= <CODE>X</CODE>
&#60;= 53 stands for a double-precision floating-point number.

<A NAME="IDX1033"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECIMAL[(M[,D])] [UNSIGNED] [ZEROFILL]</CODE>
<DD>
An unpacked floating-point number.  Behaves like a
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> column: ``unpacked'' means the number is stored as a string,
using one character for each digit of the value.  The decimal point and,
for negative numbers, the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign, are not counted in <CODE>M</CODE> (but
space for these is reserved). If <CODE>D</CODE> is 0, values will have no decimal
point or fractional part.  The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> values is
the same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> column may be constrained by the choice of <CODE>M</CODE> and
<CODE>D</CODE>.  If <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> is specified, negative values are disallowed.  

If <CODE>D</CODE> is omitted, the default is 0.  If <CODE>M</CODE> is omitted, the
default is 10.

Prior to MySQL Version 3.23, the <CODE>M</CODE> argument must include the space
needed for the sign and the decimal point.

<DT><CODE>DATE</CODE>
<DD>
A date.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.
MySQL displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1037"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
<DD>
A date and time combination.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01
00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  MySQL displays
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but allows you
to assign values to <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns using either strings or numbers.

<A NAME="IDX1038"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIMESTAMP[(M)]</CODE>
<DD>
A timestamp.  The range is <CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to sometime in the
year <CODE>2037</CODE>.  MySQL displays <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values in
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>, or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, depending on whether <CODE>M</CODE> is <CODE>14</CODE> (or missing), <CODE>12</CODE>,
<CODE>8</CODE>, or <CODE>6</CODE>, but allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
columns using either strings or numbers.  A <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is useful
for recording the date and time of an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
operation because it is automatically set to the date and time of the most
recent operation if you don't give it a value yourself.  You can also set it
to the current date and time by assigning it a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

The <CODE>M</CODE> argument affects only how a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is displayed;
its values always are stored using 4 bytes each.

Note that <CODE>TIMESTAMP(M)</CODE> columns where <CODE>M</CODE> is 8 or 14 are reported to
be numbers while other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(M)</CODE> columns are reported to be
strings.  This is just to ensure that one can reliably dump and restore
the table with these types!

MySQL displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format, but
allows you to assign values to <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns using either strings or
numbers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1040"></A>
<DT><CODE>YEAR[(2|4)]</CODE>
<DD>
A year in 2- or 4-digit format (default is 4-digit).  The allowable values
are <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE>, <CODE>0000</CODE> in the 4-digit year format,
and 1970-2069 if you use the 2-digit format (70-69).  MySQL displays
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in <CODE>YYYY</CODE> format, but allows you to assign values to
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> columns using either strings or numbers. (The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> type is
unavailable prior to MySQL Version 3.22.) See section <A HREF="manual.html#YEAR">6.2.2.4  The <CODE>YEAR</CODE> Type</A>.

<DT><CODE>[NATIONAL] CHAR(M) [BINARY]</CODE>
<DD>
A fixed-length string that is always right-padded with spaces to the
specified length when stored. The range of <CODE>M</CODE> is 0 to 255 characters
(1 to 255 prior to MySQL Version 3.23).
Trailing spaces are removed when the value is retrieved. <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values
are sorted and compared in case-insensitive fashion according to the
default character set unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> keyword is given.

<CODE>NATIONAL CHAR</CODE> (or its equivalent short form, <CODE>NCHAR</CODE>) is the
ANSI SQL way to define that a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column should use the default
CHARACTER set.  This is the default in MySQL.

<CODE>CHAR</CODE> is a shorthand for <CODE>CHARACTER</CODE>.

MySQL allows you to create a column of type
<CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>. This is mainly useful when you have to be compliant with
some old applications that depend on the existence of a column but that do not
actually use the value.  This is also quite nice when you need a
column that only can take 2 values: A <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE>, that is not defined
as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, will occupy only one bit and can take only 2 values:
<CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>""</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHAR">6.2.3.1  The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> Types</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Numeric_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Numeric_types">6.2.1  Numeric Types</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL supports all of the ANSI/ISO SQL92 numeric types.  These
types include the exact numeric data types (<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>,
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and <CODE>SMALLINT</CODE>), as well as the
approximate numeric data types (<CODE>FLOAT</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>). The keyword <CODE>INT</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, and the keyword <CODE>DEC</CODE> is a synonym for
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> types are implemented as the same
type by MySQL, as permitted by the SQL92 standard.  They are
used for values for which it is important to preserve exact precision,
for example with monetary data.  When declaring a column of one of these
types the precision and scale can be (and usually is) specified; for
example:

</P>

<PRE>
    salary DECIMAL(5,2)
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, <CODE>5</CODE> (<CODE>precision</CODE>) represents the number of
significant decimal digits that will be stored for values, and <CODE>2</CODE>
(<CODE>scale</CODE>) represents the number of digits that will be stored
following the decimal point.  In this case, therefore, the range of
values that can be stored in the <CODE>salary</CODE> column is from
<CODE>-99.99</CODE> to <CODE>99.99</CODE>.
(MySQL can actually store numbers up to <CODE>999.99</CODE> in this column
because it doesn't have to store the sign for positive numbers)

</P>
<P>
In ANSI/ISO SQL92, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL(p)</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>.  Similarly, the syntax <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> is equivalent
to <CODE>DECIMAL(p,0)</CODE>, where the implementation is allowed to decide
the value of <CODE>p</CODE>.  MySQL does not currently support either of these
variant forms of the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>/<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> data types.  This is
not generally a serious problem, as the principal benefits of these
types derive from the ability to control both precision and scale
explicitly.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values are stored as strings, rather
than as binary floating-point numbers, in order to preserve the decimal
precision of those values.  One character is used for each digit of the
value, the decimal point (if <CODE>scale</CODE> &#62; 0), and the <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> sign
(for negative numbers).  If <CODE>scale</CODE> is 0, <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values contain no decimal point or fractional part.

</P>
<P>
The maximum range of <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> values is the
same as for <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>, but the actual range for a given
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column can be constrained by the
<CODE>precision</CODE> or <CODE>scale</CODE> for a given column.  When such a column
is assigned a value with more digits following the decimal point than
are allowed by the specified <CODE>scale</CODE>, the value is rounded to that
<CODE>scale</CODE>.  When a <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> or <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> column is
assigned a value whose magnitude exceeds the range implied by the
specified (or defaulted) <CODE>precision</CODE> and <CODE>scale</CODE>,
MySQL stores the value representing the corresponding end
point of that range.

</P>
<P>
As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, MySQL also
supports the integer types <CODE>TINYINT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT</CODE>, and
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> as listed in the tables above.  Another extension is
supported by MySQL for optionally specifying the display width
of an integer value in parentheses following the base keyword for the
type (for example, <CODE>INT(4)</CODE>).  This optional width specification is
used to left-pad the display of values whose width is less than the
width specified for the column, but does not constrain the range of
values that can be stored in the column, nor the number of digits that
will be displayed for values whose width exceeds that specified for the
column.  When used in conjunction with the optional extension attribute
<CODE>ZEROFILL</CODE>, the default padding of spaces is replaced with zeroes.
For example, for a column declared as <CODE>INT(5) ZEROFILL</CODE>, a value
of <CODE>4</CODE> is retrieved as <CODE>00004</CODE>.  Note that if you store larger
values than the display width in an integer column, you may experience
problems when MySQL generates temporary tables for some
complicated joins, as in these cases MySQL trusts that the
data did fit into the original column width.

</P>
<P>
All integer types can have an optional (non-standard) attribute
<CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>.  Unsigned values can be used when you want to allow
only positive numbers in a column and you need a little bigger numeric
range for the column.

</P>
<P>
As of MySQL 4.0.2, floating-point types also can be <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>.
As with integer types, this attribute prevents negative values from
being stored in the column.  Unlike the integer types, the upper range
of column values remains the same.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> type is used to represent approximate numeric data
types. The ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard allows an optional specification of
the precision (but not the range of the exponent) in bits following the
keyword <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> in parentheses.  The MySQL implementation
also supports this optional precision specification.  When the keyword
<CODE>FLOAT</CODE> is used for a column type without a precision
specification, MySQL uses four bytes to store the values.  A
variant syntax is also supported, with two numbers given in parentheses
following the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> keyword.  With this option, the first number
continues to represent the storage requirements for the value in bytes,
and the second number specifies the number of digits to be stored and
displayed following the decimal point (as with <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> and
<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>).  When MySQL is asked to store a number for
such a column with more decimal digits following the decimal point than
specified for the column, the value is rounded to eliminate the extra
digits when the value is stored.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>REAL</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> types do not accept
precision specifications.  As an extension to the ANSI/ISO SQL92
standard, MySQL recognises <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> as a synonym for the
<CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> type.  In contrast with the standard's
requirement that the precision for <CODE>REAL</CODE> be smaller than that used
for <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE>, MySQL implements both as 8-byte
double-precision floating-point values (when not running in ``ANSI mode'').
For maximum portability, code requiring storage of approximate numeric
data values should use <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE PRECISION</CODE> with no
specification of precision or number of decimal points.

</P>
<P>
When asked to store a value in a numeric column that is outside the column
type's allowable range, MySQL clips the value to the appropriate
endpoint of the range and stores the resulting value instead.

</P>
<P>
For example, the range of an <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> to
<CODE>2147483647</CODE>.  If you try to insert <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> into an
<CODE>INT</CODE> column, the value is clipped to the lower endpoint of the range,
and <CODE>-2147483648</CODE> is stored instead. Similarly, if you try to insert
<CODE>9999999999</CODE>, <CODE>2147483647</CODE> is stored instead.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>INT</CODE> column is <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>, the size of the column's
range is the same but its endpoints shift up to <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967295</CODE>.
If you try to store <CODE>-9999999999</CODE> and <CODE>9999999999</CODE>,
the values stored in the column become <CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>4294967296</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Conversions that occur due to clipping are reported as ``warnings'' for
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
multi-row <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.

<H3><A NAME="Date_and_time_types" HREF="manual_toc.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1058"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1059"></A>

</P>

<P>
The date and time types are <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>,
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>TIME</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE>.  Each of these has a
range of legal values, as well as a ``zero'' value that is used when you
specify a really illegal value.  Note that MySQL allows you to store
certain 'not strictly' legal date values, for example <CODE>1999-11-31</CODE>.
The reason for this is that we think it's the responsibility of the
application to handle date checking, not the SQL servers.  To make the
date checking 'fast', MySQL only checks that the month is in
the range of 0-12 and the day is in the range of 0-31. The above ranges
are defined this way because MySQL allows you to store, in a
<CODE>DATE</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column, dates where the day or month-day
is zero.  This is extremely useful for applications that need to store
a birth-date for which you don't know the exact date. In this case you
simply store the date like <CODE>1999-00-00</CODE> or <CODE>1999-01-00</CODE>.  (You
cannot expect to get a correct value from functions like <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>
or <CODE>DATE_ADD</CODE> for dates like these.)

</P>
<P>
Here are some general considerations to keep in mind when working
with date and time types:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

MySQL retrieves values for a given date or time type in a standard
format, but it attempts to interpret a variety of formats for values that
you supply (for example, when you specify a value to be assigned to or
compared to a date or time type).  Nevertheless, only the formats described
in the following sections are supported.  It is expected that you will supply
legal values, and unpredictable results may occur if you use values in other
formats.

<LI>

Although MySQL tries to interpret values in several formats, it
always expects the year part of date values to be leftmost.  Dates must be
given in year-month-day order (for example, <CODE>'98-09-04'</CODE>), rather than
in the month-day-year or day-month-year orders commonly used elsewhere (for
example, <CODE>'09-04-98'</CODE>, <CODE>'04-09-98'</CODE>).

<LI>

MySQL automatically converts a date or time type value to a number
if the value is used in a numeric context, and vice versa.

<LI>

When MySQL encounters a value for a date or time type that is
out of range or otherwise illegal for the type (see the start of this
section), it converts the value to the ``zero'' value for that type.
(The exception is that out-of-range <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are clipped to
the appropriate endpoint of the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range.)  The following table

The ``zero'' values are special, but you can store or refer to them
explicitly using the values shown in the table.  You can also do this
using the values <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>, which are easier to write.

<LI>

``Zero'' date or time values used through <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> are converted
automatically to <CODE>NULL</CODE> in <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> Version 2.50.12 and above,

<A NAME="IDX1060"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1061"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL itself is Y2K-safe (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Year_2000_compliance">1.2.5  Year 2000 Compliance</A>),
but input values presented to MySQL may not be.  Any input
containing 2-digit year values is ambiguous, because the century is unknown.
Such values must be interpreted into 4-digit form because MySQL stores
years internally using four digits.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, and <CODE>YEAR</CODE> types,
MySQL interprets dates with ambiguous year values using the
following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Remember that these rules provide only reasonable guesses as to what your
data mean.  If the heuristics used by MySQL don't produce the
correct values, you should provide unambiguous input containing 4-digit
year values.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will sort 2-digit <CODE>YEAR/DATE/DATETIME</CODE> types properly.

</P>
<P>
Note also that some functions like <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> will convert a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to a number. This means that a timestamp with a
2-digit year will not work properly with these functions.  The fix in this
case is to convert the <CODE>TIMESTAMP/DATE</CODE> to 4-digit year format or
use something like <CODE>MIN(DATE_ADD(timestamp,INTERVAL 0 DAYS))</CODE>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="DATETIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#DATETIME">6.2.2.2  The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> Types</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1062"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1063"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1064"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> types are related.
This section describes their characteristics, how they are similar, and how
they differ.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> type is used when you need values that contain both date
and time information.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
values in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  The supported range is
<CODE>'1000-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> to <CODE>'9999-12-31 23:59:59'</CODE>.  (``Supported''
means that although earlier values might work, there is no guarantee that
they will.)

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>DATE</CODE> type is used when you need only a date value, without a time
part.  MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>DATE</CODE> values in
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.  The supported range is <CODE>'1000-01-01'</CODE> to
<CODE>'9999-12-31'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column type provides a type that you can use to
automatically mark <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> operations with the current
date and time.  If you have multiple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, only the first
one is updated automatically.

</P>
<P>
Automatic updating of the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column occurs under any of
the following conditions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
<LI>

The column is not specified explicitly in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement and some
other column changes value.  (Note that an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> that sets a column
to the value it already has will not cause the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to be
updated, because if you set a column to its current value, MySQL
ignores the update for efficiency.)
<LI>

You explicitly set the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns other than the first may also be set to the current
date and time.  Just set the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> or to <CODE>NOW()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can set any <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to a value different from the current
date and time by setting it explicitly to the desired value.  This is true
even for the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column.  You can use this property if,
for example, you want a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> to be set to the current date and
time when you create a row, but not to be changed whenever the row is updated
later:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Let MySQL set the column when the row is created.
This will initialise it to the current date and time.

<LI>

When you perform subsequent updates to other columns in the row, set
the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column explicitly to its current value.
</UL>

<P>
On the other hand, you may find it just as easy to use a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
column that you initialise to <CODE>NOW()</CODE> when the row is created and
leave alone for subsequent updates.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values may range from the beginning of 1970 to sometime in
the year 2037, with a resolution of one second.  Values are displayed as
numbers.

</P>
<P>
The format in which MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values depends on the display size, as illustrated by the following table.  The
`full' <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> format is 14 digits, but <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns may
be created with shorter display sizes:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Column type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Display format</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP(2)</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>YY</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
All <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns have the same storage size, regardless of
display size.  The most common display sizes are 6, 8, 12, and 14.  You can
specify an arbitrary display size at table creation time, but values of 0 or
greater than 14 are coerced to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to
13 are coerced to the next higher even number.

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values using
any of a common set of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS'</CODE> format.  A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed--any punctuation
character may be used as the delimiter between date parts or time parts.
For example, <CODE>'98-12-31 11:30:45'</CODE>, <CODE>'98.12.31 11+30+45'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98/12/31 11*30*45'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31 11^30^45'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string in either <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YY-MM-DD'</CODE> format.
A ``relaxed'' syntax is allowed here, too.  For example, <CODE>'98-12-31'</CODE>,
<CODE>'98.12.31'</CODE>, <CODE>'98/12/31'</CODE>, and <CODE>'98@12@31'</CODE> are
equivalent.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> or
<CODE>'YYMMDDHHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that the string makes sense as a
date.  For example, <CODE>'19970523091528'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523091528'</CODE> are
interpreted as <CODE>'1997-05-23 09:15:28'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971122129015'</CODE> is
illegal (it has a nonsensical minute part) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00
00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in either <CODE>'YYYYMMDD'</CODE> or <CODE>'YYMMDD'</CODE>
format, provided that the string makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>'19970523'</CODE> and <CODE>'970523'</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1997-05-23'</CODE>, but <CODE>'971332'</CODE> is illegal (it has nonsensical month
and day parts) and becomes <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905132800</CODE> and <CODE>830905132800</CODE> are interpreted as
<CODE>'1983-09-05 13:28:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in either <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>
format, provided that the number makes sense as a date.  For example,
<CODE>19830905</CODE> and <CODE>830905</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'1983-09-05'</CODE>.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> context, such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Illegal <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are converted
to the ``zero'' value of the appropriate type (<CODE>'0000-00-00 00:00:00'</CODE>,
<CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE>, or <CODE>00000000000000</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For values specified as strings that include date part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for month or day values that are less than
<CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-6-9'</CODE> is the same as <CODE>'1979-06-09'</CODE>.  Similarly,
for values specified as strings that include time part delimiters, it is not
necessary to specify two digits for hour, minute, or second values that are
less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'1979-10-30 1:2:3'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'1979-10-30 01:02:03'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values specified as numbers should be 6, 8, 12, or 14 digits long.  If the
number is 8 or 14 digits long, it is assumed to be in <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> or
<CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the first 4
digits.  If the number is 6 or 12 digits long, it is assumed to be in
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format and that the year is given by the
first 2 digits.  Numbers that are not one of these lengths are interpreted
as though padded with leading zeros to the closest length.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1065"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1066"></A>
Values specified as non-delimited strings are interpreted using their length
as given.  If the string is 8 or 14 characters long, the year is assumed to
be given by the first 4 characters.  Otherwise, the year is assumed to be
given by the first 2 characters.  The string is interpreted from left to
right to find year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values, for as many
parts as are present in the string.  This means you should not use strings
that have fewer than 6 characters.  For example, if you specify <CODE>'9903'</CODE>,
thinking that will represent March, 1999, you will find that MySQL
inserts a ``zero'' date into your table.  This is because the year and month
values are <CODE>99</CODE> and <CODE>03</CODE>, but the day part is missing (zero), so
the value is not a legal date.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns store legal values using the full precision with
which the value was specified, regardless of the display size.  This has
several implications:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Always specify year, month, and day, even if your column types are
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(4)</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP(2)</CODE>.  Otherwise, the value will not
be a legal date and <CODE>0</CODE> will be stored.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to widen a narrow <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column,
information will be displayed that previously was ``hidden''.

<LI>

Similarly, narrowing a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column does not cause information to
be lost, except in the sense that less information is shown when the values
are displayed.

<LI>

Although <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values are stored to full precision, the only
function that operates directly on the underlying stored value is
<CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>.  Other functions operate on the formatted retrieved
value.  This means you cannot use functions such as <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> or
<CODE>SECOND()</CODE> unless the relevant part of the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value is
included in the formatted value.  For example, the <CODE>HH</CODE> part of a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is not displayed unless the display size is at least
10, so trying to use <CODE>HOUR()</CODE> on shorter <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
produces a meaningless result.
</UL>

<P>
You can to some extent assign values of one date type to an object
of a different date type.  However, there may be some alteration
of the value or loss of information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is set to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>,
because the <CODE>DATE</CODE> value contains no time information.

<LI>

If you assign a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value to a <CODE>DATE</CODE>
object, the time part of the resulting value is deleted, because the
<CODE>DATE</CODE> type stores no time information.

<LI>

Remember that although <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, and <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
values all can be specified using the same set of formats, the types do not
all have the same range of values.  For example, <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> values
cannot be earlier than <CODE>1970</CODE> or later than <CODE>2037</CODE>.  This means
that a date such as <CODE>'1968-01-01'</CODE>, while legal as a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or
<CODE>DATE</CODE> value, is not a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> value and will be
converted to <CODE>0</CODE> if assigned to such an object.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1067"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1068"></A>
Be aware of certain pitfalls when specifying date values:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The relaxed format allowed for values specified as strings can be deceiving.
For example, a value such as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE> might look like a time value
because of the <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> delimiter, but if used in a date context will be
interpreted as the year <CODE>'2010-11-12'</CODE>.  The value <CODE>'10:45:15'</CODE>
will be converted to <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> because <CODE>'45'</CODE> is not a legal
month.

<LI>

The MySQL server only performs basic checking on the validity of a date:
days <CODE>00-31</CODE>, months <CODE>00-12</CODE>, years <CODE>1000-9999</CODE>.
Any date not within this range will revert to <CODE>0000-00-00</CODE>.
Please note that this still allows you to store invalid dates such as
<CODE>2002-04-31</CODE>. It allows web applications to store data from a form
without further checking. To ensure a date is valid, perform a check in
your application.

<LI>

Year values specified as two digits are ambiguous, because the century is
unknown.  MySQL interprets 2-digit year values using the following
rules:


<UL>
<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>00-69</CODE> are converted to <CODE>2000-2069</CODE>.

<LI>

Year values in the range <CODE>70-99</CODE> are converted to <CODE>1970-1999</CODE>.
</UL>

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="TIME" HREF="manual_toc.html#TIME">6.2.2.3  The <CODE>TIME</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1069"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL retrieves and displays <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE>
format (or <CODE>'HHH:MM:SS'</CODE> format for large hours values).  <CODE>TIME</CODE>
values may range from <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> to <CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.  The reason
the hours part may be so large is that the <CODE>TIME</CODE> type may be used not
only to represent a time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also
elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater
than 24 hours, or even negative).

</P>
<P>
You can specify <CODE>TIME</CODE> values in a variety of formats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

As a string in <CODE>'D HH:MM:SS.fraction'</CODE> format.  (Note that
MySQL doesn't yet store the fraction for the time column.)  One
can also use one of the following ``relaxed'' syntax:

<CODE>HH:MM:SS.fraction</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM:SS</CODE>, <CODE>HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH:MM:SS</CODE>,
<CODE>D HH:MM</CODE>, <CODE>D HH</CODE> or <CODE>SS</CODE>.  Here <CODE>D</CODE> is days between 0-33.

<LI>

As a string with no delimiters in <CODE>'HHMMSS'</CODE> format, provided that
it makes sense as a time.  For example, <CODE>'101112'</CODE> is understood as
<CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>, but <CODE>'109712'</CODE> is illegal (it has a nonsensical
minute part) and becomes <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.

<LI>

As a number in <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE> format, provided that it makes sense as a time.
For example, <CODE>101112</CODE> is understood as <CODE>'10:11:12'</CODE>.  The following
alternative formats are also understood: <CODE>SS</CODE>, <CODE>MMSS</CODE>,<CODE>HHMMSS</CODE>,
<CODE>HHMMSS.fraction</CODE>.  Note that MySQL doesn't yet store the
fraction part.

<LI>

As the result of a function that returns a value that is acceptable
in a <CODE>TIME</CODE> context, such as <CODE>CURRENT_TIME</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For <CODE>TIME</CODE> values specified as strings that include a time part
delimiter, it is not necessary to specify two digits for hours, minutes, or
seconds values that are less than <CODE>10</CODE>.  <CODE>'8:3:2'</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>'08:03:02'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Be careful about assigning ``short'' <CODE>TIME</CODE> values to a <CODE>TIME</CODE>
column. Without colons, MySQL interprets values using the
assumption that the rightmost digits represent seconds. (MySQL
interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values as elapsed time rather than as time of
day.) For example, you might think of <CODE>'1112'</CODE> and <CODE>1112</CODE> as
meaning <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE> (12 minutes after 11 o'clock), but
MySQL interprets them as <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE> (11 minutes, 12 seconds).
Similarly, <CODE>'12'</CODE> and <CODE>12</CODE> are interpreted as <CODE>'00:00:12'</CODE>.
<CODE>TIME</CODE> values with colons, by contrast, are always treated as
time of the day. That is <CODE>'11:12'</CODE> will mean <CODE>'11:12:00'</CODE>,
not <CODE>'00:11:12'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Values that lie outside the <CODE>TIME</CODE> range
but are otherwise legal are clipped to the appropriate
endpoint of the range.  For example, <CODE>'-850:00:00'</CODE> and
<CODE>'850:00:00'</CODE> are converted to <CODE>'-838:59:59'</CODE> and
<CODE>'838:59:59'</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Illegal <CODE>TIME</CODE> values are converted to <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE>.  Note that
because <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> is itself a legal <CODE>TIME</CODE> value, there is no way
to tell, from a value of <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> stored in a table, whether the
original value was specified as <CODE>'00:00:00'</CODE> or whether it was illegal.

As a four-digit number in the range <CODE>1901</CODE> to <CODE>2155</CODE>.

<LI>

As a two-digit string in the range <CODE>'00'</CODE> to <CODE>'99'</CODE>.  Values in the

converted to <CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2000</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and
<CODE>1970</CODE> to <CODE>1999</CODE>.

<LI>

As a two-digit number in the range <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>99</CODE>.  Values in the
ranges <CODE>1</CODE> to <CODE>69</CODE> and <CODE>70</CODE> to <CODE>99</CODE> are converted to
<CODE>YEAR</CODE> values in the ranges <CODE>2001</CODE> to <CODE>2069</CODE> and <CODE>1970</CODE>
to <CODE>1999</CODE>.  Note that the range for two-digit numbers is slightly
different from the range for two-digit strings, because you cannot specify zero
directly as a number and have it be interpreted as <CODE>2000</CODE>.  You
<STRONG>must</STRONG> specify it as a string <CODE>'0'</CODE> or <CODE>'00'</CODE> or it will be

<H4><A NAME="CHAR" HREF="manual_toc.html#CHAR">6.2.3.1  The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> Types</A></H4>

<P>
The <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> types are similar, but differ in the
way they are stored and retrieved.

</P>
<P>
The length of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> column is fixed to the length that you declare
when you create the table.  The length can be any value between 1 and 255.
(As of MySQL Version 3.23, the length of <CODE>CHAR</CODE> may be 0 to 255.)
When <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values are stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the
specified length.  When <CODE>CHAR</CODE> values are retrieved, trailing spaces are
removed.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are variable-length strings.  You can
declare a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to be any length between 1 and 255, just as
for <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns.  However, in contrast to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
values are stored using only as many characters as are needed, plus one byte
to record the length.  Values are not padded; instead, trailing spaces are
removed when values are stored.  (This space removal differs from the ANSI
SQL specification.)

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that
exceeds the column's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

</P>
<P>
The following table illustrates the differences between the two types of columns
by showing the result of storing various string values into <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE>
and <CODE>VARCHAR(4)</CODE> columns:

</TABLE>

<P>
The values retrieved from the <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR(4)</CODE> columns
will be the same in each case, because trailing spaces are removed from
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns upon retrieval.

</P>
<P>
Values in <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns are sorted and compared
in case-insensitive fashion, unless the <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute was
specified when the table was created.  The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute means
that column values are sorted and compared in case-sensitive fashion
according to the ASCII order of the machine where the MySQL
server is running. <CODE>BINARY</CODE> doesn't affect how the column is stored
or retrieved.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> attribute is sticky.  This means that if a column marked
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> is used in an expression, the whole expression is compared as a
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
MySQL may silently change the type of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
column at table creation time.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1075"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1076"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>BLOB</CODE> is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of
data.  The four <CODE>BLOB</CODE> types <CODE>TINYBLOB</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>MEDIUMBLOB</CODE>, and <CODE>LONGBLOB</CODE> differ only in the maximum length of
the values they can hold.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Storage_requirements">6.2.6  Column Type Storage Requirements</A>.

</P>
<P>
The four <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types <CODE>TINYTEXT</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMTEXT</CODE>,
and <CODE>LONGTEXT</CODE> correspond to the four <CODE>BLOB</CODE> types and have the
same maximum lengths and storage requirements.  The only difference between
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types is that sorting and comparison is performed
in case-sensitive fashion for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values and case-insensitive fashion
for <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values.  In other words, a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> is a case-insensitive
<CODE>BLOB</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you assign a value to a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column that exceeds
the column type's maximum length, the value is truncated to fit.

</P>
<P>
In most respects, you can regard a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column as a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>
column that can be as big as you like.  Similarly, you can regard a
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column as a <CODE>VARCHAR BINARY</CODE> column.  The differences are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can have indexes on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns with
MySQL Version 3.23.2 and newer. Older versions of
MySQL did not support this.

<LI>

There is no trailing-space removal for <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns
when values are stored, as there is for <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1077"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1078"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1079"></A>
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns cannot have <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> defines <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values as <CODE>LONGVARBINARY</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> values as <CODE>LONGVARCHAR</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Because <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> values may be extremely long, you
may run up against some constraints when using them:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you want to use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column, you must convert the column value into a fixed-length
object. The standard way to do this is with the <CODE>SUBSTRING</CODE>
function.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT comment FROM tbl_name,SUBSTRING(comment,20) AS substr
    -&#62;                 ORDER BY substr;
</PRE>

If you don't do this, only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes of the
column are used when sorting.  The default value of <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> is
1024; this value can be changed using the <CODE>-O</CODE> option when starting the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server. You can group on an expression involving <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> values by specifying the column position or by using an alias:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100) FROM tbl_name GROUP BY 2;
mysql&#62; SELECT id,SUBSTRING(blob_col,1,100) AS b FROM tbl_name GROUP BY b;
</PRE>

<LI>

The maximum size of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> object is determined by its
type, but the largest value you can actually transmit between the client and
server is determined by the amount of available memory and the size of the
communications buffers.  You can change the message buffer size, but you must
do so on both the server and client ends. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that each <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> value is represented
internally by a separately allocated object. This is in contrast to all
other column types, for which storage is allocated once per column when
the table is opened.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="ENUM" HREF="manual_toc.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1080"></A>

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is a string object whose value normally is chosen from a list
of allowed values that are enumerated explicitly in the column specification
at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
The value may also be the empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) or <CODE>NULL</CODE> under
certain circumstances:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you insert an invalid value into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> (that is, a string not
present in the list of allowed values), the empty string is inserted
instead as a special error value. This string can be distinguished from a
'normal' empty string by the fact that this string has the numerical value
0. More about this later.

<LI>

If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is declared <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is also a legal value
for the column, and the default value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  If an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value is the first element of the
list of allowed values.
</UL>

<P>
Each enumeration value has an index:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Values from the list of allowable elements in the column specification are
numbered beginning with 1.

<LI>

The index value of the empty string error value is 0.  This means that you
can use the following <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement to find rows into which invalid
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values were assigned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE enum_col=0;
</PRE>

<LI>

The index of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>ENUM("one", "two", "three")</CODE> can
have any of the values shown here.  The index of each value is also shown:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Index</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>NULL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>NULL</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>""</CODE> </TD><TD> 0
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"one"</CODE> </TD><TD> 1
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"two"</CODE> </TD><TD> 2
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>"three"</CODE> </TD><TD> 3
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
An enumeration can have a maximum of 65535 elements.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.51 trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values when the table is created.

</P>
<P>
Lettercase is irrelevant when you assign values to an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column.
However, values retrieved from the column later have lettercase matching the
values that were used to specify the allowable values at table creation time.

</P>
<P>
If you retrieve an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> in a numeric context, the column value's
index is returned.  For example, you can retrieve numeric values from
an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT enum_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If you store a number into an <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the number is treated as an
index, and the value stored is the enumeration member with that index.
(However, this will not work with <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>, which treats all
input as strings.)
It's not advisable to store numbers in an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> string because
it will make things confusing.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to the order in which the enumeration
members were listed in the column specification.  (In other words,
<CODE>ENUM</CODE> values are sorted according to their index numbers.)  For
example, <CODE>"a"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"b"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("a", "b")</CODE>, but
<CODE>"b"</CODE> sorts before <CODE>"a"</CODE> for <CODE>ENUM("b", "a")</CODE>.  The empty
string sorts before non-empty strings, and <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
all other enumeration values.
To prevent unexpected results, specify the <CODE>ENUM</CODE> list in alphabetical
order. You can also use <CODE>GROUP BY CONCAT(col)</CODE> to make sure the column
is sorted alphabetically rather than by index number.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE enum_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>ENUM</CODE> definition in the second column.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SET" HREF="manual_toc.html#SET">6.2.3.4  The <CODE>SET</CODE> Type</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1081"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> is a string object that can have zero or more values, each of
which must be chosen from a list of allowed values specified when the table
is created.  <CODE>SET</CODE> column values that consist of multiple set members
are specified with members separated by commas (<SAMP>`,'</SAMP>).  A consequence of
this is that <CODE>SET</CODE> member values cannot themselves contain commas.

</P>
<P>
For example, a column specified as <CODE>SET("one", "two") NOT NULL</CODE> can have
any of these values:

</P>

<PRE>
""
"one"
"two"
"one,two"
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum of 64 different members.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.51 trailing spaces are automatically deleted from
<CODE>SET</CODE> values when the table is created.

</P>
<P>
MySQL stores <CODE>SET</CODE> values numerically, with the low-order bit
of the stored value corresponding to the first set member.  If you retrieve a
<CODE>SET</CODE> value in a numeric context, the value retrieved has bits set
corresponding to the set members that make up the column value.  For example,
you can retrieve numeric values from a <CODE>SET</CODE> column like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT set_col+0 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
If a number is stored into a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, the bits that
are set in the binary representation of the number determine the
set members in the column value.  Suppose a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>.  Then the members have the following bit
values:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><CODE>SET</CODE> <STRONG>member</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Decimal value</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Binary value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>a</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0001</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>b</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>2</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0010</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>c</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>4</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>0100</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>d</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>8</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>1000</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
If you assign a value of <CODE>9</CODE> to this column, that is <CODE>1001</CODE> in
binary, so the first and fourth <CODE>SET</CODE> value members <CODE>"a"</CODE> and
<CODE>"d"</CODE> are selected and the resulting value is <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For a value containing more than one <CODE>SET</CODE> element, it does not matter
what order the elements are listed in when you insert the value.  It also
does not matter how many times a given element is listed in the value.
When the value is retrieved later, each element in the value will appear
once, with elements listed according to the order in which they were
specified at table creation time.  For example, if a column is specified as
<CODE>SET("a","b","c","d")</CODE>, then <CODE>"a,d"</CODE>, <CODE>"d,a"</CODE>, and
<CODE>"d,a,a,d,d"</CODE> will all appear as <CODE>"a,d"</CODE> when retrieved.

</P>
<P>
If you set a <CODE>SET</CODE> column to an unsupported value, the value will
be ignored.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SET</CODE> values are sorted numerically.  <CODE>NULL</CODE> values sort before
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> <CODE>SET</CODE> values.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a <CODE>SET</CODE> column using
the <CODE>LIKE</CODE> operator or the <CODE>FIND_IN_SET()</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col LIKE '%value%';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE FIND_IN_SET('value',set_col)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
But the following will also work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col = 'val1,val2';
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE set_col &#38; 1;
</PRE>

<P>
The first of these statements looks for an exact match.  The second looks
for values containing the first set member.

</P>
<P>
If you want to get all possible values for a <CODE>SET</CODE> column, you should
use: <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE set_column_name</CODE> and parse
the <CODE>SET</CODE> definition in the second column.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1082"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1083"></A>

</P>
<P>
For the most efficient use of storage, try to use the most precise type in
all cases. For example, if an integer column will be used for values in the
range between <CODE>1</CODE> and <CODE>99999</CODE>, <CODE>MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED</CODE> is the
best type.

</P>
<P>
Accurate representation of monetary values is a common problem. In
MySQL, you should use the <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> type. This is stored as
a string, so no loss of accuracy should occur. If accuracy is not
too important, the <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> type may also be good enough.

</P>
<P>
For high precision, you can always convert to a fixed-point type stored
in a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE>. This allows you to do all calculations with integers
and convert results back to floating-point values only when necessary.

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and the <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types are variable-length
types, for which the storage requirements depend on the actual length of
column values (represented by <CODE>L</CODE> in the preceding table), rather than
on the type's maximum possible size.  For example, a <CODE>VARCHAR(10)</CODE>
column can hold a string with a maximum length of 10 characters.  The actual
storage required is the length of the string (<CODE>L</CODE>), plus 1 byte to
record the length of the string.  For the string <CODE>'abcd'</CODE>, <CODE>L</CODE> is 4
and the storage requirement is 5 bytes.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> types require 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes to record
the length of the column value, depending on the maximum possible length of
the type.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a table includes any variable-length column types, the record format will
also be variable-length.  Note that when a table is created, MySQL
may, under certain conditions, change a column from a variable-length type to a
fixed-length type, or vice-versa.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.

The size of an <CODE>ENUM</CODE> object is determined by the number of
different enumeration values.  One byte is used for enumerations with up
to 255 possible values.  Two bytes are used for enumerations with up to
65535 values. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ENUM">6.2.3.3  The <CODE>ENUM</CODE> Type</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1099"></A>
The size of a <CODE>SET</CODE> object is determined by the number of different
set members.  If the set size is <CODE>N</CODE>, the object occupies <CODE>(N+7)/8</CODE>
bytes, rounded up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 bytes.  A <CODE>SET</CODE> can have a maximum
of 64 members. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET">6.2.3.4  The <CODE>SET</CODE> Type</A>.

A <CODE>select_expression</CODE> or <CODE>where_definition</CODE> in a SQL statement
can consist of any expression using the functions described below.

</P>
<P>
An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE> always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value
unless otherwise indicated in the documentation for the operators and
functions involved in the expression.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: there must be no whitespace between a function name and the
parentheses following it. This helps the MySQL parser distinguish
between function calls and references to tables or columns that happen to
have the same name as a function.  Spaces around arguments are permitted,
though.

</P>
<P>
You can force MySQL to accept spaces after the function name by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--ansi</CODE> or using the
<CODE>CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> to <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, but in this case all

Comparison operations result in a value of <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE), <CODE>0</CODE> (FALSE),
or <CODE>NULL</CODE>. These functions work for both numbers and strings.  Strings
are automatically converted to numbers and numbers to strings as needed (as
in Perl).

</P>
<P>
MySQL performs comparisons using the following
rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If one or both arguments are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the result of the comparison
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, except for the <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> operator.

<LI>

If both arguments in a comparison operation are strings, they are compared as
strings.

<LI>

If both arguments are integers, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

Hexadecimal values are treated as binary strings if not compared to a number.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1110"></A>
If one of the arguments is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> or <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column and
the other argument is a constant, the constant is converted
to a timestamp before the comparison is performed. This is done to be more
ODBC-friendly.

<LI>

In all other cases, the arguments are compared as floating-point (real)
numbers.
</UL>

<P>
By default, string comparisons are done in case-independent fashion using the
current character set (ISO-8859-1 Latin1 by default, which also works
excellently for English).

</P>
<P>
The following examples illustrate conversion of strings to numbers for comparison
operations:

<DT><CODE>expr BETWEEN min AND max</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>expr</CODE> is greater than or equal to <CODE>min</CODE> and <CODE>expr</CODE> is

otherwise it returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  This is equivalent to the expression
<CODE>(min &#60;= expr AND expr &#60;= max)</CODE> if all the arguments are of the
same type. Otherwise type conversion takes place, according to the rules
above, but applied to all the three arguments. <STRONG>Note</STRONG> that before
4.0.5 arguments were converted to the type of <CODE>expr</CODE> instead.

<DT><CODE>expr IN (value,...)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>expr</CODE> is any of the values in the <CODE>IN</CODE> list,
else returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  If all values are constants, then all values are
evaluated according to the type of <CODE>expr</CODE> and sorted. The search for the
item is then done using a binary search. This means <CODE>IN</CODE> is very quick
if the <CODE>IN</CODE> value list consists entirely of constants.  If <CODE>expr</CODE>
is a case-sensitive string expression, the string comparison is performed in
case-sensitive fashion:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 2 IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'wefwf' IN (0,3,5,'wefwf');
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

From 4.1 (in line with the SQL-99 standard), <CODE>IN</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> 
not only if the expression on the left hand side is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, but also if
no match is found in the list and one of the expressions in the list is 
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1135"></A>
<DT><CODE>expr NOT IN (value,...)</CODE>
<DD>

<A NAME="IDX1136"></A>
<DT><CODE>ISNULL(expr)</CODE>

If <CODE>expr</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>ISNULL()</CODE> returns <CODE>1</CODE>, otherwise

        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT ISNULL(1/0);
        -&#62; 1

false!

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1139"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTERVAL(N,N1,N2,N3,...)</CODE>

Returns <CODE>0</CODE> if <CODE>N</CODE> &#60; <CODE>N1</CODE>, <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>N</CODE> &#60; <CODE>N2</CODE>
and so on. All arguments are treated as integers.  It is required that
<CODE>N1</CODE> &#60; <CODE>N2</CODE> &#60; <CODE>N3</CODE> &#60; <CODE>...</CODE> &#60; <CODE>Nn</CODE> for this function
to work correctly. This is because a binary search is used (very fast):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 44, 200);
        -&#62; 3

If <CODE>expr1</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> returns <CODE>expr1</CODE>,

In 4.0.6 and above the default result value of
<CODE>IFNULL(expr1,expr2)</CODE> is the more 'general' of the two expressions,
in the order <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>.The difference
to earlier MySQL versions are mostly notable when you create a table
based on expressions or MySQL has to internally store a value from
<CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> in a temporary table.


<PRE>

In MySQL 4.0.6 the type for column 'test' is <CODE>CHAR(4)</CODE> while in

<DD>
If <CODE>expr1</CODE> is TRUE (<CODE>expr1 &#60;&#62; 0</CODE> and <CODE>expr1 &#60;&#62; NULL</CODE>) then
<CODE>IF()</CODE> returns <CODE>expr2</CODE>, else it returns <CODE>expr3</CODE>.
<CODE>IF()</CODE> returns a numeric or string value, depending on the context

mysql&#62; SELECT IF(STRCMP('test','test1'),'no','yes');
        -&#62; 'no'
</PRE>

If <CODE>expr2</CODE> or <CODE>expr3</CODE> is explicitely <CODE>NULL</CODE> then the
result type of the <CODE>IF()</CODE> function is the type of the not
<CODE>NULL</CODE> column. (This behaviour is new in MySQL 4.0.3).

<CODE>expr1</CODE> is evaluated as an integer value, which means that if you are
testing floating-point or string values, you should do so using a comparison
operation:

mysql&#62; SELECT IF(0.1,1,0);
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT IF(0.1&#60;&#62;0,1,0);
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

In the first case above, <CODE>IF(0.1)</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> because <CODE>0.1</CODE>
is converted to an integer value, resulting in a test of <CODE>IF(0)</CODE>.  This
may not be what you expect.  In the second case, the comparison tests the
original floating-point value to see whether it is non-zero.  The result
of the comparison is used as an integer.

The default return type of <CODE>IF()</CODE> (which may matter when it is
stored into a temporary table) is calculated in MySQL Version
3.23 as follows:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Expression</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Return value</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns string </TD><TD> string
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns a floating-point value </TD><TD> floating-point
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>expr2 or expr3 returns an integer </TD><TD> integer
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

If expr2 and expr3 are strings, then the result is case-insensitive if
both strings are case-insensitive. (Starting from 3.23.51)

<A NAME="IDX1155"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE value WHEN [compare-value] THEN result [WHEN [compare-value] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result [WHEN [condition] THEN result ...] [ELSE result] END</CODE>
<DD>
The first version returns the <CODE>result</CODE> where
<CODE>value=compare-value</CODE>. The second version returns the result for
the first condition, which is true. If there was no matching result
value, then the result after <CODE>ELSE</CODE> is returned. If there is no
<CODE>ELSE</CODE> part then <CODE>NULL</CODE> is returned:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE 1 WHEN 1 THEN "one"
           WHEN 2 THEN "two" ELSE "more" END;
       -&#62; "one"
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE WHEN 1&#62;0 THEN "true" ELSE "false" END;
       -&#62; "true"
mysql&#62; SELECT CASE BINARY "B" WHEN "a" THEN 1 WHEN "b" THEN 2 END;
       -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The type of the return value (<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> or
<CODE>STRING</CODE>) is the same as the type of the first returned value (the
expression after the first <CODE>THEN</CODE>).

See also the <CODE>ORD()</CODE> function.

<A NAME="IDX1159"></A>
<DT><CODE>ORD(str)</CODE>
<DD>
If the leftmost character of the string <CODE>str</CODE> is a multi-byte character,
returns the code for that character, calculated from the ASCII code values
of its constituent characters using this formula:
<CODE>((first byte ASCII code)*256+(second byte ASCII code))[*256+third byte ASCII code...]</CODE>.
If the leftmost character is not a multi-byte character, returns the same
value that the <CODE>ASCII()</CODE> function does:

<DT><CODE>CONV(N,from_base,to_base)</CODE>
<DD>
Converts numbers between different number bases.  Returns a string
representation of the number <CODE>N</CODE>, converted from base <CODE>from_base</CODE>
to base <CODE>to_base</CODE>.  Returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> if any argument is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
The argument <CODE>N</CODE> is interpreted as an integer, but may be specified as
an integer or a string.  The minimum base is <CODE>2</CODE> and the maximum base is
<CODE>36</CODE>.  If <CODE>to_base</CODE> is a negative number, <CODE>N</CODE> is regarded as a
signed number.  Otherwise, <CODE>N</CODE> is treated as unsigned.  <CODE>CONV</CODE> works
with 64-bit precision:

according to the current character set mapping (the default is ISO-8859-1
Latin1):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT UCASE('Hej');

<DT><CODE>LOAD_FILE(file_name)</CODE>
<DD>
Reads the file and returns the file contents as a string.  The file
must be on the server, you must specify the full pathname to the
file, and you must have the <CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege.  The file must
be readable by all and be smaller than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>.

If the file doesn't exist or can't be read due to one of the above reasons,
the function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE tbl_name
           SET blob_column=LOAD_FILE("/tmp/picture")
           WHERE id=1;
</PRE>

If you are not using MySQL Version 3.23, you have to do the reading
of the file inside your application and create an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement
to update the database with the file information. One way to do this, if
you are using the MySQL++ library, can be found at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql++/mysql++-examples.html</a>.

<A NAME="IDX1204"></A>
<DT><CODE>QUOTE(str)</CODE>

quotes and with each instance of single quote (<SAMP>`''</SAMP>), backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>),
ASCII NUL, and Control-Z preceded by a backslash.  If the argument is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>, the return value is the word ``NULL'' without surrounding
single quotes.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT QUOTE("Don't");

MySQL automatically converts numbers to strings as necessary, and
vice-versa:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+"1";
        -&#62; 2
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(2,' test');
        -&#62; '2 test'
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to convert a number to a string explicitly, pass it as the
argument to <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If a string function is given a binary string as an argument, the resulting
string is also a binary string.  A number converted to a string is treated as
a binary string.  This only affects comparisons.

<DT><CODE>expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape-char']</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1209"></A>
 
Pattern matching using
SQL simple regular expression comparison. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> (TRUE) or <CODE>0</CODE>
(FALSE).  With <CODE>LIKE</CODE> you can use the following two wildcard characters
in the pattern:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Char</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches any number of characters, even zero characters
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches exactly one character
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David_';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE '%D%v%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To test for literal instances of a wildcard character, precede the character
with the escape character.  If you don't specify the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> character,
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is assumed:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>String</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>\%</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>%</CODE> character
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>\_</CODE> </TD><TD> Matches one <CODE>_</CODE> character
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David!' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David\_';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

To specify a different escape character, use the <CODE>ESCAPE</CODE> clause:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'David_' LIKE 'David|_' ESCAPE '|';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

The following two statements illustrate that string comparisons are
case-insensitive unless one of the operands is a binary string:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'abc' LIKE 'ABC';
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT 'abc' LIKE BINARY 'ABC';
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<CODE>LIKE</CODE> is allowed on numeric expressions! (This is a MySQL
extension to the ANSI SQL <CODE>LIKE</CODE>.)


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 10 LIKE '1%';
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape syntax in strings (for example,
<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that you use in your <CODE>LIKE</CODE>
strings.  For example, to search for <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\n'</SAMP>.  To
search for <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>, specify it as <SAMP>`\\\\'</SAMP> (the backslashes are stripped
once by the parser and another time when the pattern match is done, leaving
a single backslash to be matched).

Performs a pattern match of a string expression <CODE>expr</CODE> against a pattern
<CODE>pat</CODE>.  The pattern can be an extended regular expression.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Regexp">G  MySQL Regular Expressions</A>.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>expr</CODE> matches <CODE>pat</CODE>, otherwise
returns <CODE>0</CODE>.  <CODE>RLIKE</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>REGEXP</CODE>, provided for
<CODE>mSQL</CODE> compatibility. Note: Because MySQL uses the C escape
syntax in strings (for example, <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>), you must double any <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that
you use in your <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> strings.  As of MySQL Version 3.23.4,
<CODE>REGEXP</CODE> is case-insensitive for normal (not binary) strings:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP 'm%y%%';
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT 'Monty!' REGEXP '.*';
        -&#62; 1

<CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> is used for full-text search and returns
relevance - similarity measure between the text in columns
<CODE>(col1,col2,...)</CODE> and the query <CODE>expr</CODE>. Relevance is a
positive floating-point number. Zero relevance means no similarity.
<CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST()</CODE> is available in MySQL version
3.23.23 or later. <CODE>IN BOOLEAN MODE</CODE> extension was added in version

<DT><CODE><CODE>BINARY</CODE></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1222"></A>
 
The <CODE>BINARY</CODE> operator casts the string following it to a binary string.
This is an easy way to force a column comparison to be case-sensitive even
if the column isn't defined as <CODE>BINARY</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "a" = "A";
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT BINARY "a" = "A";
        -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<CODE>BINARY string</CODE> is a shorthand for <CODE>CAST(string AS BINARY)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.
<CODE>BINARY</CODE> was introduced in MySQL Version 3.23.0.

Note that in some context MySQL will not be able to use the
index efficiently when you cast an indexed column to <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
If you want to compare a blob case-insensitively you can always convert
the blob to upper case before doing the comparison:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT 'A' LIKE UPPER(blob_col) FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
We plan to soon introduce casting between different character sets to
make string comparison even more flexible.

<CODE>X</CODE>. Returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> if <CODE>X</CODE> is not in the range <CODE>-1</CODE> to
<CODE>1</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ASIN(0.2);

<A NAME="IDX1262"></A>
<DT><CODE>ATAN(X)</CODE>

<CODE>X</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ATAN(2);
        -&#62; 1.107149
mysql&#62; SELECT ATAN(-2);

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1263"></A>
<DT><CODE>ATAN(Y,X)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ATAN2(Y,X)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the arc tangent of the two variables <CODE>X</CODE> and <CODE>Y</CODE>. It is
similar to calculating the arc tangent of <CODE>Y / X</CODE>, except that the
signs of both arguments are used to determine the quadrant of the
result:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ATAN(-2,2);
        -&#62; -0.785398
mysql&#62; SELECT ATAN2(PI(),0);
        -&#62; 1.570796

Returns the cotangent of <CODE>X</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COT(12);

mysql&#62; SELECT COT(0);
        -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1265"></A>
<DT><CODE>RAND()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>RAND(N)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a random floating-point value in the range <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.0</CODE>.
If an integer argument <CODE>N</CODE> is specified, it is used as the seed value:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT RAND();
        -&#62; 0.9233482386203
mysql&#62; SELECT RAND(20);
        -&#62; 0.15888261251047
mysql&#62; SELECT RAND(20);
        -&#62; 0.15888261251047
mysql&#62; SELECT RAND();
        -&#62; 0.63553050033332
mysql&#62; SELECT RAND();
        -&#62; 0.70100469486881
</PRE>

You can't use a column with <CODE>RAND()</CODE> values in an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>
clause, because <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> would evaluate the column multiple times.
In MySQL Version 3.23, you can, however, do:
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND()</CODE>

This is useful to get a random sample of a set <CODE>SELECT * FROM
table1,table2 WHERE a=b AND c&#60;d ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1000</CODE>.

Note that a <CODE>RAND()</CODE> in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will be re-evaluated
every time the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> is executed.

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> is not meant to be a perfect random generator, but instead a
fast way to generate ad hoc random numbers that will be portable between
platforms for the same MySQL version.

<A NAME="IDX1266"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAST(X,Y,...)</CODE>
<DD>
With two or more arguments, returns the smallest (minimum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the following rules:


<UL>
<LI>

If the return value is used in an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> context, or all arguments
are integer-valued, they are compared as integers.

<LI>

If the return value is used in a <CODE>REAL</CODE> context, or all arguments are
real-valued, they are compared as reals.

<LI>

If any argument is a case-sensitive string, the arguments are compared
as case-sensitive strings.

<LI>

In other cases, the arguments are compared as case-insensitive strings:
</UL>


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT LEAST(2,0);
        -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT LEAST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
        -&#62; 3.0
mysql&#62; SELECT LEAST("B","A","C");
        -&#62; "A"
</PRE>

In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use <CODE>MIN()</CODE>
instead of <CODE>LEAST</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1267"></A>
<DT><CODE>GREATEST(X,Y,...)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the largest (maximum-valued) argument.
The arguments are compared using the same rules as for <CODE>LEAST</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT GREATEST(2,0);
        -&#62; 2
mysql&#62; SELECT GREATEST(34.0,3.0,5.0,767.0);
        -&#62; 767.0
mysql&#62; SELECT GREATEST("B","A","C");
        -&#62; "C"
</PRE>

In MySQL versions prior to Version 3.22.5, you can use <CODE>MAX()</CODE>
instead of <CODE>GREATEST</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1268"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEGREES(X)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the argument <CODE>X</CODE>, converted from radians to degrees:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DEGREES(PI());
        -&#62; 180.000000
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1269"></A>
<DT><CODE>RADIANS(X)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the argument <CODE>X</CODE>, converted from degrees to radians:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT RADIANS(90);
        -&#62; 1.570796
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1270"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRUNCATE(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number <CODE>X</CODE>, truncated to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals.  If <CODE>D</CODE>
is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no decimal point or fractional part:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.223,1);
        -&#62; 1.2
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.999,1);
        -&#62; 1.9
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(1.999,0);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(-1.999,1);
        -&#62; -1.9
</PRE>

Starting from MySQL 3.23.51 all numbers are rounded towards zero.

If <CODE>D</CODE> is negative, then the whole part of the number is zeroed out:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(122,-2);
       -&#62; 100
</PRE>

Note that as decimal numbers are normally not stored as exact numbers in
computers, but as double values, you may be fooled by the following
result:

<A NAME="IDX1271"></A>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT TRUNCATE(10.28*100,0);
       -&#62; 1027
</PRE>

The above happens because 10.28 is actually stored as something like
10.2799999999999999.

<DT><CODE>WEEK(date)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>WEEK(date,first)</CODE>
<DD>
With a single argument, returns the week for <CODE>date</CODE>, in the range
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>53</CODE> (yes, there may be the beginnings of a week 53),
for locations where Sunday is the first day of the week.  The
two-argument form of <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> allows you to specify whether the
week starts on Sunday or Monday and whether the return value should be in
the range <CODE>0-53</CODE> or <CODE>1-52</CODE>.

Here is a table for how the second argument works:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20');
        -&#62; 7
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',0);
        -&#62; 7
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-02-20',1);
        -&#62; 8
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('1998-12-31',1);
        -&#62; 53
</PRE>

Note: in Version 4.0, <CODE>WEEK(#,0)</CODE> was changed to match the
calendar in the USA.

Note that if a week is the last week of the previous year, MySQL will
return 0 if you don't use 2 or 3 as the optional argument:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEAR('2000-01-01'), WEEK('2000-01-01',0);
        -&#62; 2000, 0
mysql&#62; SELECT WEEK('2000-01-01',2);
        -&#62; 52
</PRE>

One could argue that MySQL should return <CODE>52</CODE> for the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function as the given date is actually the 52 second week of 1999.  We
decided to return 0 instead as we want the function to return 'the week
number in the given year'.  This makes the usage of the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function reliable when combined with other functions that extracts a
date part from a date.

If you would prefer to know the correct year-week, then you should use
the 2 or 3 as the optional argument or use the <CODE>YEARWEEK()</CODE>
function:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEARWEEK('2000-01-01');
        -&#62; 199952
mysql&#62; SELECT MID(YEARWEEK('2000-01-01'),5,2);
        -&#62; 52
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1283"></A>
<DT><CODE>YEAR(date)</CODE>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEAR('98-02-03');
        -&#62; 1998
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>YEARWEEK(date)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>YEARWEEK(date,first)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns year and week for a date.  The second arguments works exactly
like the second argument to <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>.  Note that the year may be
different from the year in the date argument for the first and the last
week of the year:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT YEARWEEK('1987-01-01');
        -&#62; 198653
</PRE>

Note that the week number is different from what the <CODE>WEEK()</CODE>
function would return (<CODE>0</CODE>) for optional arguments 0 or 1,
as <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> then returns the week in the context of the given year.

<A NAME="IDX1284"></A>

These functions perform date arithmetic.  They are new for MySQL
Version 3.22.  <CODE>ADDDATE()</CODE> and <CODE>SUBDATE()</CODE> are synonyms for
<CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> and <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE>.

In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> instead of
<CODE>DATE_ADD()</CODE> and <CODE>DATE_SUB()</CODE> if the expression on the right side is
a date or datetime column. (See example below.)

<CODE>date</CODE> is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>DATE</CODE> value specifying the starting
date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is an expression specifying the interval value to be added
or subtracted from the starting date.  <CODE>expr</CODE> is a string; it may start
with a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> for negative intervals.  <CODE>type</CODE> is a keyword indicating
how the expression should be interpreted.

The related function <CODE>EXTRACT(type FROM date)</CODE> returns the 'type'
interval from the date.

The following table shows how the <CODE>type</CODE> and <CODE>expr</CODE> arguments
are related:

MySQL allows any punctuation delimiter in the <CODE>expr</CODE> format.
Those shown in the table are the suggested delimiters.  If the <CODE>date</CODE>
argument is a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value and your calculations involve only
<CODE>YEAR</CODE>, <CODE>MONTH</CODE>, and <CODE>DAY</CODE> parts (that is, no time parts), the
result is a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value.  Otherwise, the result is a <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "1997-12-31 23:59:59" + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
        -&#62; 1998-01-01 00:00:00
mysql&#62; SELECT INTERVAL 1 DAY + "1997-12-31";

mysql&#62; SELECT "1998-01-01" - INTERVAL 1 SECOND;
       -&#62; 1997-12-31 23:59:59
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1997-12-31 23:59:59",

        -&#62; 1997-12-30 22:58:59
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1998-01-01 00:00:00",
    -&#62;                 INTERVAL "-1 10" DAY_HOUR);
        -&#62; 1997-12-30 14:00:00
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_SUB("1998-01-02", INTERVAL 31 DAY);

</PRE>

If you specify an interval value that is too short (does not include all the
interval parts that would be expected from the <CODE>type</CODE> keyword),
MySQL assumes you have left out the leftmost parts of the interval
value.  For example, if you specify a <CODE>type</CODE> of <CODE>DAY_SECOND</CODE>, the
value of <CODE>expr</CODE> is expected to have days, hours, minutes, and seconds
parts.  If you specify a value like <CODE>"1:10"</CODE>, MySQL assumes
that the days and hours parts are missing and the value represents minutes
and seconds.  In other words, <CODE>"1:10" DAY_SECOND</CODE> is interpreted in such
a way that it is equivalent to <CODE>"1:10" MINUTE_SECOND</CODE>.  This is
analogous to the way that MySQL interprets <CODE>TIME</CODE> values
as representing elapsed time rather than as time of day.

Note that if you add or subtract a date value against something that
contains a time part, the date value will be automatically converted to a
datetime value:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1999-01-01", INTERVAL 1 DAY);
       -&#62; 1999-01-02
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD("1999-01-01", INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
       -&#62; 1999-01-01 01:00:00
</PRE>

If you use really incorrect dates, the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If you add
<CODE>MONTH</CODE>, <CODE>YEAR_MONTH</CODE>, or <CODE>YEAR</CODE> and the resulting date
has a day that is larger than the maximum day for the new month, the day is
adjusted to the maximum days in the new month:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DATE_ADD('1998-01-30', INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
        -&#62; 1998-02-28
</PRE>

As of MySQL Version 3.23, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character is required before
format specifier characters.  In earlier versions of MySQL,
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> was optional.

The reason the ranges for the month and day specifiers begin with zero
is that MySQL allows incomplete dates such as <CODE>'2004-00-00'</CODE> to be
stored as of MySQL 3.23.

<A NAME="IDX1298"></A>
<DT><CODE>TIME_FORMAT(time,format)</CODE>
<DD>
This is used like the <CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> function above, but the
<CODE>format</CODE> string may contain only those format specifiers that handle
hours, minutes, and seconds.  Other specifiers produce a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value or
<CODE>0</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1299"></A>

Returns today's date as a value in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>
format, depending on whether the function is used in a string or numeric
context:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CURDATE();

<DT><CODE>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the current date and time as a value in <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE>
or <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format, depending on whether the function is used in
a string or numeric context:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT NOW();

mysql&#62; SELECT NOW() + 0;
        -&#62; 19971215235026
</PRE>

Note that <CODE>NOW()</CODE> is only evaluated once per query, namely at the
start of query execution. This means that multiple references to
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> within a single query will always give the same time.

<A NAME="IDX1306"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date)</CODE>
<DD>
If called with no argument, returns a Unix timestamp (seconds since
<CODE>'1970-01-01 00:00:00'</CODE> GMT) as an unsigned integer. If
<CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> is called with a <CODE>date</CODE> argument, it
returns the value of the argument as seconds since <CODE>'1970-01-01
00:00:00'</CODE> GMT.  <CODE>date</CODE> may be a <CODE>DATE</CODE> string, a
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> string, a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, or a number in the format
<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE> in local time:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP();
        -&#62; 882226357
mysql&#62; SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('1997-10-04 22:23:00');
        -&#62; 875996580
</PRE>

When <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP</CODE> is used on a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the function
will return the internal timestamp value directly, with no implicit
``string-to-unix-timestamp'' conversion.
If you pass an out-of-range date to <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> it will
return 0, but please note that only basic checking is performed
(year 1970-2037, month 01-12, day 01-31).

If you want to subtract <CODE>UNIX_TIMESTAMP()</CODE> columns, you may want to
cast the result to signed integers. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1307"></A>
<DT><CODE>FROM_UNIXTIME(unix_timestamp)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a representation of the <CODE>unix_timestamp</CODE> argument as a value in
<CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> format, depending on
whether the function is used in a string or numeric context:

</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1309"></A>
<DT><CODE>SEC_TO_TIME(seconds)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the <CODE>seconds</CODE> argument, converted to hours, minutes, and seconds,
as a value in <CODE>'HH:MM:SS'</CODE> or <CODE>HHMMSS</CODE> format, depending on whether
the function is used in a string or numeric context:

<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>CAST</CODE> function is:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
CAST(expression AS type)

or

CONVERT(expression,type)
</PRE>

<P>
Where type is one of:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>BINARY</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>CHAR</CODE> (New in 4.0.6)
<LI>

<CODE>DATE</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>DATETIME</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>SIGNED {INTEGER}</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>TIME</CODE>
<LI>

<CODE>UNSIGNED {INTEGER}</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>CAST()</CODE> is ANSI SQL99 syntax and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> is ODBC syntax.

</P>
<P>
The cast function is mainly useful when you want to create a column with
a specific type in a <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT CAST('2000-01-01' AS DATE);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>CAST(string AS BINARY</CODE> is the same thing as <CODE>BINARY string</CODE>.
<CODE>CAST(expr AS CHAR</CODE> threats expression to be a string with the
default character set.

</P>
<P>
To cast a string to a numeric value, you don't normally have to do
anything; just use the string value as it would be a number:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT 1+'1';
       -&#62; 2
</PRE>

<P>
If you use a number in string context the number will automatically be
converted to a <CODE>BINARY</CODE> string.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT("hello you ",2);
       -&#62;  "hello you 2"
</PRE>

<P>
MySQL supports arithmetic with both signed and unsigned 64-bit values.
If you are using an numerical operations (like <CODE>+</CODE>) and one of the
operands are <CODE>unsigned integer</CODE>, then the result will be unsigned.
You can override this by using the <CODE>SIGNED</CODE> and <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE>
cast operators, which will cast the operation to a signed or
unsigned 64-bit integer, respectively.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED)
        -&#62; 18446744073709551615
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(CAST(1-2 AS UNSIGNED) AS SIGNED);
        -&#62; -1
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if either operation is a floating-point value (In this context
<CODE>DECIMAL()</CODE> is regarded as a floating-point value) the result will
be a floating-point value and is not affected by the above rule.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CAST(1 AS UNSIGNED) -2.0
        -&#62; -1.0
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a string in an arithmetic operation, this is converted
to a floating-point number.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> functions were added in MySQL 4.0.2.

</P>
<P>
The handing of unsigned values was changed in MySQL 4.0 to be able to
support <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> values properly. If you have some code that you
want to run in both MySQL 4.0 and 3.23 (in which case you probably can't
use the CAST function), you can use the following trick to get a signed
result when subtracting two unsigned integer columns:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT (unsigned_column_1+0.0)-(unsigned_column_2+0.0);
</PRE>

<P>
The idea is that the columns are converted to floating-point before doing
the subtraction.

</P>
<P>
If you get a problem with <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> columns in your old MySQL
application when porting to MySQL 4.0, you can use the
<CODE>--sql-mode=NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> option when starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  Note however that as long as you use this, you will not
be able to make efficient use of the <CODE>UNSIGNED BIGINT</CODE> column type.

Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using the Unix <CODE>crypt()</CODE> system call. The
<CODE>salt</CODE> argument should be a string with two characters.
(As of MySQL Version 3.22.16, <CODE>salt</CODE> may be longer than two characters.):


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT ENCRYPT("hello");
        -&#62; 'VxuFAJXVARROc'
</PRE>

If <CODE>crypt()</CODE> is not available on your system, <CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> always
returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<CODE>ENCRYPT()</CODE> ignores all but the first 8 characters of <CODE>str</CODE>, at
least on some systems.  This will be determined by the behaviour of the
underlying <CODE>crypt()</CODE> system call.

<A NAME="IDX1338"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENCODE(str,pass_str)</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypt <CODE>str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the password.
To decrypt the result, use <CODE>DECODE()</CODE>.

The results is a binary string of the same length as <CODE>string</CODE>.
If you want to save it in a column, use a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column type.

<A NAME="IDX1339"></A>
<DT><CODE>DECODE(crypt_str,pass_str)</CODE>
<DD>
Descrypts the encrypted string <CODE>crypt_str</CODE> using <CODE>pass_str</CODE> as the
password.  <CODE>crypt_str</CODE> should be a string returned from
<CODE>ENCODE()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1340"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD5(string)</CODE>
<DD>
Calculates an MD5 128 bit checksum for the string. The value is returned
as a 32 digit hex number that may, for example, be used as a hash key:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT MD5("testing");
        -&#62; 'ae2b1fca515949e5d54fb22b8ed95575'
</PRE>

This is the "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm".

<A NAME="IDX1341"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1342"></A>
<DT><CODE>SHA1(string)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>SHA(string)</CODE>
<DD>
Calculates an SHA1 160 bit checksum for the string, as described in
RFC 3174 (Secure Hash Algorithm). The value is returned as a 40 digit
hex number, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> in case the input argument was <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
One of the possible uses for this function is as a hash key. You can
also use it as cryptographically safe function for storing passwords.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SHA1("abc");
        -&#62; 'a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d'
</PRE>

<CODE>SHA1()</CODE> was added in version 4.0.2, and can be considered
a cryptographically more secure equivalent of <CODE>MD5()</CODE>.
<CODE>SHA()</CODE> is synonym for <CODE>SHA1()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1343"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1344"></A>
<DT><CODE>AES_ENCRYPT(string,key_string)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>AES_DECRYPT(string,key_string)</CODE>
<DD>
These functions allow encryption/decryption of data using the official
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, previously known as Rijndael.
Encoding with 128 bit key length is used, but you can extend it up to
256 bit by patching the source. We chose 128 bits because it is much
faster and it is usually secure enough.

The input arguments may be any length. If either argument is <CODE>NULL</CODE>,
the result of this function is also <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

As AES is a block level algorithm, padding is used to encode uneven length
strings and so the result string length may be calculated as
16*(trunc(string_length/16)+1).

If <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE> detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it
will return <CODE>NULL</CODE>. However, it is possible for <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE>
to return a non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value (possibly garbage) if the input data or
the key was invalid.

You can use the AES functions to store data in an encrypted form by
modifying your queries:

<PRE>
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT("text","password"));
</PRE>

You can get even more security by avoiding transferring the key over the
connection for each query, which can be accomplished by storing it in a
server side variable at connection time:

<PRE>
SELECT @password:="my password";
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT("text",@password));
</PRE>

<CODE>AES_ENCRYPT()</CODE> and <CODE>AES_DECRYPT()</CODE> were added in version 4.0.2,
and can be considered the most cryptographically secure encryption
functions currently available in MySQL.

<A NAME="IDX1345"></A>
<DT><CODE>DES_ENCRYPT(string_to_encrypt [, (key_number | key_string) ] )</CODE>
<DD>
Encrypts the string with the given key using the Triple-DES algorithm.

Note that this function only works if you have configured MySQL with
SSL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.9  Using Secure Connections</A>.

The encryption key to use is chosen the following way:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Argument</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Only one argument </TD><TD>
The first key from <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> is used.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>key number </TD><TD>
The given key (0-9) from the <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> is used.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>string </TD><TD>
The given <CODE>key_string</CODE> will be used to crypt <CODE>string_to_encrypt</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

The return string will be a binary string where the first character
will be <CODE>CHAR(128 | key_number)</CODE>.

The 128 is added to make it easier to recognise an encrypted key.
If you use a string key, <CODE>key_number</CODE> will be 127.

On error, this function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

The string length for the result will be
<CODE>new_length= org_length + (8-(org_length % 8))+1</CODE>.

The <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> has the following format:


<PRE>
key_number des_key_string
key_number des_key_string
</PRE>

Each <CODE>key_number</CODE> must be a number in the range from 0 to 9.  Lines in
the file may be in any order.  <CODE>des_key_string</CODE> is the string that
will be used to encrypt the message.  Between the number and the key there
should be at least one space.  The first key is the default key that will
be used if you don't specify any key argument to <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE>

You can tell MySQL to read new key values from the key file with the
<CODE>FLUSH DES_KEY_FILE</CODE> command.  This requires the <CODE>Reload_priv</CODE>
privilege.

One benefit of having a set of default keys is that it gives applications
a way to check for existence of encrypted column values, without giving
the end user the right to decrypt those values.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT customer_address FROM customer_table WHERE
       crypted_credit_card = DES_ENCRYPT("credit_card_number");
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1346"></A>
<DT><CODE>DES_DECRYPT(string_to_decrypt [, key_string])</CODE>
<DD>
Decrypts a string encrypted with <CODE>DES_ENCRYPT()</CODE>.

Note that this function only works if you have configured MySQL with
SSL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Secure_connections">4.3.9  Using Secure Connections</A>.

If no <CODE>key_string</CODE> argument is given, <CODE>DES_DECRYPT()</CODE> examines
the first byte of the encrypted string to determine the DES key number
that was used to encrypt the original string, then reads the key
from the <CODE>des-key-file</CODE> to decrypt the message.  For this to work
the user must have the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.

If you pass this function a <CODE>key_string</CODE> argument, that string
is used as the key for decrypting the message.

If the <CODE>string_to_decrypt</CODE> doesn't look like an encrypted string, MySQL
will return the given <CODE>string_to_decrypt</CODE>.

On error, this function returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1347"></A>
<DT><CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID([expr])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
        -&#62; 195
</PRE>

The last ID that was generated is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

If you insert many rows at the same time with an insert statement,
<CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> returns the value for the first inserted row.
The reason for this is to make it possible to easily reproduce
the same <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement against some other server.

<A NAME="IDX1348"></A>
If <CODE>expr</CODE> is given as an argument to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, then
the value of the argument is returned by the function, and is set as the
next value to be returned by <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.  This can be used
to simulate sequences:

First create the table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE sequence (id INT NOT NULL);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO sequence VALUES (0);
</PRE>

Then the table can be used to generate sequence numbers like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE sequence SET id=LAST_INSERT_ID(id+1);
</PRE>

You can generate sequences without calling <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>, but the
utility of using the function this way is that the ID value is maintained in
the server as the last automatically generated value (multi-user safe).
You can retrieve the new ID as you would read any normal
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value in MySQL. For example, <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>
(without an argument) will return the new ID.  The C API function
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> can also be used to get the value.

Note that as <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is only updated after <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements, so you can't use the C API function to
retrieve the value for <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE> after executing other
SQL statements like <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1349"></A>
<DT><CODE>FORMAT(X,D)</CODE>
<DD>
Formats the number <CODE>X</CODE> to a format like <CODE>'#,###,###.##'</CODE>, rounded
to <CODE>D</CODE> decimals.  If <CODE>D</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>, the result will have no
decimal point or fractional part:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.123456, 4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1235'
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.1,4);
        -&#62; '12,332.1000'
mysql&#62; SELECT FORMAT(12332.2,0);
        -&#62; '12,332'
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1350"></A>
<DT><CODE>VERSION()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a string indicating the MySQL server version:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT VERSION();
        -&#62; '3.23.13-log'
</PRE>

Note that if your version ends with <CODE>-log</CODE> this means that logging is
enabled.

<A NAME="IDX1351"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONNECTION_ID()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the connection id (<CODE>thread_id</CODE>) for the connection.
Every connection has its own unique id:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
        -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1352"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1353"></A>
<DT><CODE>GET_LOCK(str,timeout)</CODE>
<DD>
Tries to obtain a lock with a name given by the string <CODE>str</CODE>, with a
timeout of <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.  Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was obtained
successfully, <CODE>0</CODE> if the attempt timed out, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> if an error
occurred (such as running out of memory or the thread was killed with
<CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE>).  A lock is released when you execute
<CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>, execute a new <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>, or the thread
terminates.  This function can be used to implement application locks or to
simulate record locks.  It blocks requests by other clients for locks with
the same name; clients that agree on a given lock string name can use the
string to perform cooperative advisory locking:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT GET_LOCK("lock1",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT IS_FREE_LOCK("lock2");
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT GET_LOCK("lock2",10);
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT RELEASE_LOCK("lock2");
        -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT RELEASE_LOCK("lock1");
        -&#62; NULL
</PRE>

Note that the second <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE> call returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> because
the lock <CODE>"lock1"</CODE> was automatically released by the second
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> call.

<A NAME="IDX1354"></A>
<DT><CODE>RELEASE_LOCK(str)</CODE>
<DD>
Releases the lock named by the string <CODE>str</CODE> that was obtained with
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE>. Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock was released, <CODE>0</CODE> if the
lock wasn't locked by this thread (in which case the lock is not released),
and <CODE>NULL</CODE> if the named lock didn't exist.  The lock will not exist if
it was never obtained by a call to <CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> or if it already has
been released.

The <CODE>DO</CODE> statement is convinient to use with <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#DO">6.4.10  <CODE>DO</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1355"></A>
<DT><CODE>IS_FREE_LOCK(str)</CODE>
<DD>
Checks if the lock named <CODE>str</CODE> is free to use (i.e., not locked).
Returns <CODE>1</CODE> if the lock is free (no one is using the lock),
<CODE>0</CODE> if the lock is in use, and
<CODE>NULL</CODE> on errors (like incorrect arguments).

<A NAME="IDX1356"></A>
<DT><CODE>BENCHMARK(count,expr)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> function executes the expression <CODE>expr</CODE>
repeatedly <CODE>count</CODE> times.  It may be used to time how fast MySQL
processes the expression.  The result value is always <CODE>0</CODE>.  The intended
use is in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, which reports query execution times:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE("hello","goodbye"));
+----------------------------------------------+
| BENCHMARK(1000000,ENCODE("hello","goodbye")) |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                            0 |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (4.74 sec)
</PRE>

The time reported is elapsed time on the client end, not CPU time on the
server end.  It may be advisable to execute <CODE>BENCHMARK()</CODE> several
times, and interpret the result with regard to how heavily loaded the
server machine is.

<A NAME="IDX1357"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_NTOA(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Given a numeric network address (4 or 8 byte), returns the dotted-quad
representation of the address as a string:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT INET_NTOA(3520061480);
       -&#62;  "209.207.224.40"
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1358"></A>
<DT><CODE>INET_ATON(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Given the dotted-quad representation of a network address as a string,
returns an integer that represents the numeric value of the address.
Addresses may be 4 or 8 byte addresses:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT INET_ATON("209.207.224.40");
       -&#62;  3520061480
</PRE>

The generated number is always in network byte order; for example the
above number is calculated as <CODE>209*256^3 + 207*256^2 + 224*256 +40</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1359"></A>
<DT><CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT(log_name, log_pos)</CODE>
<DD>
Blocks until the slave reaches (i.e. has read and applied all updates up
to) the specified position in the master log. If master information is
not initialised, or if the arguments are incorrect, returns
<CODE>NULL</CODE>. If the slave is not running, will block and wait until it
is started and goes to or past the specified position. If the slave is
already past the specified position, returns immediately.

If <CODE>timeout</CODE> (new in 4.0.10) is specified, will give up waiting
when <CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds have elapsed. <CODE>timeout</CODE> must be greater
than 0; a zero or negative <CODE>timeout</CODE> means no timeout.  The return
value is the number of log events it had to wait to get to the specified
position, or <CODE>NULL</CODE> in case of error, or <CODE>-1</CODE> if the timeout
has been exceeded.

This command is useful for control of master-slave synchronisation, but
was originally written to facilitate replication testing.

<A NAME="IDX1360"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1361"></A>
<DT><CODE>FOUND_ROWS()</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number of rows that the last <CODE>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ...</CODE>
command would have returned, if it had not been restricted with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tbl_name
       WHERE id &#62; 100 LIMIT 10;
mysql&#62; SELECT FOUND_ROWS();
</PRE>

The second <CODE>SELECT</CODE> will return a number indicating how many rows the
first <CODE>SELECT</CODE> would have returned had it been written without the
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause.

Note that if you are using <CODE>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS ...</CODE> MySQL has
to calculate all rows in the result set.  However, this is faster than
if you would not use <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>, as the result set need not be sent
to the client.

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> is available starting at MySQL version 4.0.0.

<DT><CODE>COUNT(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1364"></A>
 
Returns a count of the number of non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in the rows
retrieved by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student.student_name,COUNT(*)
    -&#62;        FROM student,course
    -&#62;        WHERE student.student_id=course.student_id
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;

</PRE>

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is somewhat different in that it returns a count of
the number of rows retrieved, whether they contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.

<CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE> is optimised to
return very quickly if the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> retrieves from one table, no
other columns are retrieved, and there is no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1365"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1366"></A>
<DT><CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT expr,[expr...])</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a count of the number of different non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> values:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT results) FROM student;
</PRE>

In MySQL you can get the number of distinct expression
combinations that don't contain NULL by giving a list of expressions.
In ANSI SQL you would have to do a concatenation of all expressions
inside <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1367"></A>
<DT><CODE>AVG(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the average value of <CODE>expr</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name, AVG(test_score)
    -&#62;        FROM student
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1368"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1369"></A>
<DT><CODE>MIN(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>MAX(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the minimum or maximum value of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and
<CODE>MAX()</CODE> may take a string argument; in such cases they return the
minimum or maximum string value. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_indexes">5.4.3  How MySQL Uses Indexes</A>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)
    -&#62;        FROM student
    -&#62;        GROUP BY student_name;
</PRE>

In <CODE>MIN()</CODE>, <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and other aggregate functions, MySQL
currently compares <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> columns by their string
value rather than by the string's relative position in the set.
This will be rectified.

<A NAME="IDX1370"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUM(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the sum of <CODE>expr</CODE>.  Note that if the return set has no rows,
it returns NULL!

<A NAME="IDX1371"></A>
<DT><CODE>VARIANCE(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the standard variance of <CODE>expr</CODE>. This is an extension to
ANSI SQL (available only in version 4.1 or later).

<A NAME="IDX1372"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1373"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1374"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1375"></A>
<DT><CODE>STD(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>STDDEV(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the standard deviation of <CODE>expr</CODE>. This is an extension to
ANSI SQL. The <CODE>STDDEV()</CODE> form of this function is provided for Oracle
compatibility.

<A NAME="IDX1376"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIT_OR(expr)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the bitwise <CODE>OR</CODE> of all bits in <CODE>expr</CODE>. The calculation is
performed with 64-bit (<CODE>BIGINT</CODE>) precision.

<A NAME="IDX1377"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIT_AND(expr)</CODE>

Returns the bitwise <CODE>AND</CODE> of all bits in <CODE>expr</CODE>. The calculation is
performed with 64-bit (<CODE>BIGINT</CODE>) precision.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1378"></A>
MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. You can use columns or
calculations in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expressions that don't appear in
the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part. This stands for <EM>any possible value for this
group</EM>.  You can use this to get better performance by avoiding sorting and
grouping on unnecessary items.  For example, you don't need to group on
<CODE>customer.name</CODE> in the following query:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT order.custid,customer.name,MAX(payments)
    -&#62;        FROM order,customer
    -&#62;        WHERE order.custid = customer.custid
    -&#62;        GROUP BY order.custid;
</PRE>

<P>
In ANSI SQL, you would have to add <CODE>customer.name</CODE> to the <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> clause.  In MySQL, the name is redundant if you don't run in
ANSI mode.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Don't use this feature</STRONG> if the columns you omit from the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part aren't unique in the group!  You will get
unpredictable results.

</P>
<P>
In some cases, you can use <CODE>MIN()</CODE> and <CODE>MAX()</CODE> to obtain a specific
column value even if it isn't unique. The following gives the value of
<CODE>column</CODE> from the row containing the smallest value in the <CODE>sort</CODE>
column:

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22 (or earlier) or if

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.
<CODE>select_expression</CODE> indicates the columns you want to retrieve.
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> may also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.  For example:

A <CODE>SELECT</CODE> expression may be given an alias using <CODE>AS</CODE>. The alias
is used as the expression's column name and can be used with
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clauses.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
    FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
</PRE>

<LI>

It is not allowed to use a column alias in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause,
because the column value may not yet be determined when the
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause is executed.

The <CODE>FROM table_references</CODE> clause indicates the tables from which to
retrieve rows. If you name more than one table, you are performing a
join.  For information on join syntax, see section <A HREF="manual.html#JOIN">6.4.1.1  <CODE>JOIN</CODE> Syntax</A>.
For each table specified, you may optionally specify an alias.

<PRE>
table_name [[AS] alias] [[USE INDEX (key_list)] | [IGNORE INDEX (key_list)] | FORCE INDEX (key_list)]]
</PRE>

As of MySQL Version 3.23.12, you can give hints about which
index MySQL should use when retrieving information from a
table. This is useful if <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> shows that MySQL is
using the wrong index from the list of possible indexes.  By specifying
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>, you can tell MySQL to use only one of the
possible indexes to find rows in the table.  The alternative syntax
<CODE>IGNORE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> can be used to tell MySQL to not use some
particular index.

In MySQL 4.0.9 you can also use <CODE>FORCE INDEX</CODE>. This acts likes
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> but with the addition that a table scan
is assumed to be VERY expensive.  In other words a table scan will
only be used if there is no way to use one of the given index to
find rows in the table.

<CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE KEY</CODE> are synonyms for <CODE>USE/IGNORE/FORCE INDEX</CODE>.

<LI>

You can refer to a table as <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> (within the current database),
or as <CODE>dbname.tbl_name</CODE> to explicitly specify a database.
You can refer to a column as <CODE>col_name</CODE>, <CODE>tbl_name.col_name</CODE>, or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE>.  You need not specify a <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> or
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE> prefix for a column reference in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement unless the reference would be ambiguous.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>,
for examples of ambiguity that require the more explicit column reference
forms.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1394"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1395"></A>
A table reference may be aliased using <CODE>tbl_name [AS] alias_name</CODE>:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee AS t1, info AS t2
    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
mysql&#62; SELECT t1.name, t2.salary FROM employee t1, info t2
    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

Columns selected for output may be referred to in <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clauses using column names, column aliases, or column
positions.  Column positions begin with 1:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY region, seed;
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region AS r, seed AS s FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY r, s;
mysql&#62; SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
    -&#62;        ORDER BY 2, 3;
</PRE>

To sort in reverse order, add the <CODE>DESC</CODE> (descending) keyword to the
name of the column in the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause that you are sorting by.
The default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly using
the <CODE>ASC</CODE> keyword.

<LI>

You can in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause use any of the functions that
MySQL support. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Functions">6.3  Functions for Use in <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>WHERE</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>HAVING</CODE> clause can refer to any column or alias named in the
<CODE>select_expression</CODE>. It is applied last, just before items are sent to
the client, with no optimisation. Don't use <CODE>HAVING</CODE> for items that
should be in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  For example, do not write this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name HAVING col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

Write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col_name FROM tbl_name WHERE col_name &#62; 0;
</PRE>

In MySQL Version 3.22.5 or later, you can also write queries like this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT user,MAX(salary) FROM users
    -&#62;        GROUP BY user HAVING MAX(salary)&#62;10;
</PRE>

In older MySQL versions, you can write this instead:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT user,MAX(salary) AS sum FROM users
    -&#62;        group by user HAVING sum&#62;10;
</PRE>

<LI>

The options <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>, <CODE>DISTINCTROW</CODE> and <CODE>ALL</CODE> specify
whether duplicate rows should be returned. The default is (<CODE>ALL</CODE>),
all matching rows are returned. <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> and <CODE>DISTINCTROW</CODE>
are synonyms and specify that duplicate rows in the result set should
be removed.

<LI>

All options beginning with <CODE>SQL_</CODE>, <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE>, and
<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> are MySQL extensions to ANSI SQL.

<LI>

<CODE>HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE> will give the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> higher priority than
a statement that updates a table.  You should only use this for queries
that are very fast and must be done at once.  A <CODE>SELECT HIGH_PRIORITY</CODE>
query will run if the table is locked for read even if there is an update
statement that is waiting for the table to be free.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE> can be used with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE>
to tell the optimiser that the result set will have many rows.  In this case,
MySQL will directly use disk-based temporary tables if needed.
MySQL will also, in this case, prefer sorting to doing a
temporary table with a key on the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> elements.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</CODE> will force the result to be put into a temporary
table. This will help MySQL free the table locks early and will help
in cases where it takes a long time to send the result set to the client.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE>, a MySQL-specific option, can be used
with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> or <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> to tell the optimiser that the
result set will be small.  In this case, MySQL will use fast
temporary tables to store the resulting table instead of using sorting. In
MySQL Version 3.23 this shouldn't normally be needed.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> (version 4.0.0 and up) tells MySQL to calculate
how many rows there would be in the result set, disregarding any
<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause.
The number of rows can then be retrieved with <CODE>SELECT FOUND_ROWS()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

Please note that in versions prior to 4.1.0 this does not work with
<CODE>LIMIT 0</CODE>, which is optimised to return instantly (resulting in a
row count of 0). See section <A HREF="manual.html#LIMIT_optimisation">5.2.8  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>LIMIT</CODE></A>.
<LI>

<CODE>SQL_CACHE</CODE> tells MySQL to store the query result in the query cache
if you are using <CODE>QUERY_CACHE_TYPE=2</CODE> (<CODE>DEMAND</CODE>).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache">6.9  MySQL Query Cache</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>SQL_NO_CACHE</CODE> tells MySQL to not allow the query result to be stored
in the query cache. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache">6.9  MySQL Query Cache</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1396"></A>
If you use <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, the output rows will be sorted according to the
<CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> as if you would have had an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> over all the fields
in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>. MySQL has extended the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> so that
you can also specify <CODE>ASC</CODE> and <CODE>DESC</CODE> to <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>:


<PRE>
SELECT a,COUNT(b) FROM test_table GROUP BY a DESC
</PRE>

<LI>

MySQL has extended the use of <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> to allow you to
select fields which are not mentioned in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> clause.
If you are not getting the results you expect from your query, please
read the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> description.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Group_by_functions">6.3.7  Functions for Use with <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> Clauses</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1397"></A>
<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> forces the optimiser to join the tables in the order in
which they are listed in the <CODE>FROM</CODE> clause. You can use this to speed up
a query if the optimiser joins the tables in non-optimal order.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause can be used to constrain the number of rows returned
by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement.  <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> takes one or two numeric
arguments.  The arguments must be integer constants.

If two arguments are given, the first specifies the offset of the first row to
return, the second specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
The offset of the initial row is 0 (not 1):

To be compatible with PostgreSQL MySQL also supports the syntax:
<CODE>LIMIT # OFFSET #</CODE>.


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5,10;  # Retrieve rows 6-15
</PRE>

To retrieve all rows from a certain offset upto the end of the result set,
you can use -1 for the second parameter:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 95,-1; # Retrieve rows 96-last.
</PRE>

If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows to return:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;     # Retrieve first 5 rows
</PRE>

In other words, <CODE>LIMIT n</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>LIMIT 0,n</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1398"></A>
The <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'</CODE> form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> writes
the selected rows to a file. The file is created on the server host and
cannot already exist (among other things, this prevents database tables and
files such as <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT> from being destroyed).  You must have the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege on the server host to use this form of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.

<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> is mainly intended to let you very
quickly dump a table on the server machine. If you want to create the
resulting file on some other host than the server host you can't use
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>. In this case you should instead use some
client program like <CODE>mysqldump --tab</CODE> or <CODE>mysql -e "SELECT
..." &#62; outfile</CODE> to generate the file.

<CODE>SELECT ...  INTO OUTFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE>; the syntax for the <CODE>export_options</CODE> part of the statement
consists of the same <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses that are used
with the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

In the resulting text file, only the following characters are escaped by
the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character:


<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character

<LI>The first character in <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>

<LI>The first character in <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>

</UL>

Additionally, <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is converted to <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> followed by 0
(<CODE>ASCII 48</CODE>).

The reason for the above is that you <STRONG>must</STRONG> escape any <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>, or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
characters to reliably be able to read the file back. <CODE>ASCII 0</CODE> is
escaped to make it easier to view with some pagers.

As the resulting file doesn't have to conform to the SQL syntax, nothing
else need be escaped.

Here follows an example of getting a file in the format used by many
old programs.


<PRE>
SELECT a,b,a+b INTO OUTFILE "/tmp/result.text"
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
FROM test_table;
</PRE>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1399"></A>
If you use <CODE>INTO DUMPFILE</CODE> instead of <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, MySQL
will only write one row into the file, without any column or line
terminations and without any escaping.  This is useful if you want to
store a blob in a file.

<LI>

Note that any file created by <CODE>INTO OUTFILE</CODE> and <CODE>INTO
DUMPFILE</CODE> is going to be writeable for all users!  The reason is that the
MySQL server can't create a file that is owned by anyone else
than the user it's running as (you should never run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root),
the file has to be world-writeable so that you can manipulate it.

<LI>

If you are using <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE> on a storage engine with page/row locks,
the examined rows will be write locked.

</PRE>

<P>
You should generally not have any conditions in the <CODE>ON</CODE> part that are
used to restrict which rows you have in the result set (there are exceptions
to this rule).  If you want to restrict which rows should be in the result,
you have to do this in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

</P>

    -&#62;        WHERE t1.name = t2.name;
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>ON</CODE> conditional is any conditional of the form that may be used in
a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

If there is no matching record for the right table in the <CODE>ON</CODE> or
<CODE>USING</CODE> part in a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>, a row with all columns set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is used for the right table.  You can use this fact to find
records in a table that have no counterpart in another table:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT table1.* FROM table1
    -&#62;        LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id=table2.id
    -&#62;        WHERE table2.id IS NULL;
</PRE>

This example finds all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with an <CODE>id</CODE> value that is
not present in <CODE>table2</CODE> (that is, all rows in <CODE>table1</CODE> with no
corresponding row in <CODE>table2</CODE>).  This assumes that <CODE>table2.id</CODE> is
declared <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, of course. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LEFT_JOIN_optimisation">5.2.6  How MySQL Optimises <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>USING</CODE> <CODE>(column_list)</CODE> clause names a list of columns that must
exist in both tables.  A <CODE>USING</CODE> clause such as:


<PRE>
A LEFT JOIN B USING (C1,C2,C3,...)
</PRE>

is defined to be semantically identical to an <CODE>ON</CODE> expression like
this:


<PRE>
A.C1=B.C1 AND A.C2=B.C2 AND A.C3=B.C3,...
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>NATURAL [LEFT] JOIN</CODE> of two tables is defined to be
semantically equivalent to an <CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> or a <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>
with a <CODE>USING</CODE> clause that names all columns that exist in both
tables.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1415"></A>
<CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>,</CODE> (comma) are semantically equivalent.
Both do a full join between the tables used. Normally, you specify
how the tables should be linked in the WHERE condition.

<LI>

<CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE> works analogously as <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>.  To keep code
portable across databases, it's recommended to use <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE>
instead of <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1416"></A>
<CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> is identical to <CODE>JOIN</CODE>, except that the left table
is always read before the right table. This can be used for those (few)

in datafile) matching <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition. It is faster than
<CODE>HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name</CODE> when a full table scan is desired.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HANDLER ... CLOSE</CODE> closes a table that was opened with
<CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HANDLER</CODE> is a somewhat low-level statement.  For example, it does
not provide consistency.  That is, <CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE> does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>
take a snapshot of the table, and does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> lock the table. This
means that after a <CODE>HANDLER ... OPEN</CODE> is issued, table data can be
modified (by this or any other thread) and these modifications may appear
only partially in <CODE>HANDLER ... NEXT</CODE> or <CODE>HANDLER ... PREV</CODE> scans.

<P>
The reasons to use this interface instead of normal SQL are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

It's faster than <CODE>SELECT</CODE> because:

<UL>
<LI>

A designated storage engine is allocated for the thread in <CODE>HANDLER OPEN</CODE>.
<LI>

There is less parsing involved.
<LI>

No optimiser and no query checking overhead.
<LI>

The used table doesn't have to be locked between two handler requests.
<LI>

The handler interface doesn't have to provide a consistent look of the
data (for example, dirty-reads are allowed), so the storage engine can
do optimisations that SQL doesn't normally allow.
</UL>

<LI>

It makes it much easier to port applications that uses an ISAM like
interface to MySQL.
<LI>

It allows one to traverse a database in a manner that is not easy
(in some case impossible) to do with SQL. The handler interface is
more natural way to look at data when working with applications that
provide an interactive user interfaces to the database.

<CODE>INSERT</CODE> inserts new rows into an existing table.  The <CODE>INSERT
...  VALUES</CODE> form of the statement inserts rows based on explicitly
specified values.  The <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> form inserts rows
selected from another table or tables.  The <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES</CODE>
form with multiple value lists is supported in MySQL Version
3.22.5 or later.  The <CODE>col_name=expression</CODE> syntax is supported in
MySQL Version 3.22.10 or later.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is the table into which rows should be inserted.  The column
name list or the <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns the statement
specifies values for:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you specify no column list for <CODE>INSERT ... VALUES</CODE> or <CODE>INSERT
... SELECT</CODE>, values for all columns must be provided in the
<CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list or by the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  If you don't know the order of
the columns in the table, use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to find out.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1426"></A>
Any column not explicitly given a value is set to its default value.  For
example, if you specify a column list that doesn't name all the columns in
the table, unnamed columns are set to their default values.  Default value
assignment is described in section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

You can also use the keyword <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> to set a column to its
default value. (New in MySQL 4.0.3.)  This makes it easier to write
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements that assign values to all but a few columns,
because it allows you to avoid writing an incomplete <CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list
(a list that does not include a value for each column in the table).
Otherwise, you would have to write out the list of column names
corresponding to each value in the <CODE>VALUES()</CODE> list.

MySQL always has a default value for all fields. This is something
that is imposed on MySQL to be able to work with both transactional
and not transactional tables.

Our view is that checking of fields content should be done in the
application and not in the database server.
<LI>

An <CODE>expression</CODE> may refer to any column that was set earlier in a value
list.  For example, you can say this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(15,col1*2);
</PRE>

But not this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);
</PRE>

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the
table.  In this case the client has to wait until the insert statement
is completed, which may take a long time if the table is in heavy
use. This is in contrast to <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, which lets the client
continue at once.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT_DELAYED">6.4.4  <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> Syntax</A>.  Note that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
should normally not be used with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as this disables
concurrent inserts. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.

<LI>

If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with many value
rows, any rows that duplicate an existing <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
key in the table are ignored and are not inserted.  If you do not specify
<CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the insert is aborted if there is any row that duplicates an
existing key value.  You can determine with the C API function
<CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> how many rows were inserted into the table.

<LI>

If you specify <CODE>ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE</CODE> clause (new in MySQL 4.1.0), and
a row is inserted that would cause a duplicate value in <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key, an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> of the old row is performed. For
example, the command:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
   --&#62; ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;
</PRE>

in case of column <CODE>a</CODE> is declared as <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> and already
holds <CODE>1</CODE> once, would be identical to the


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1;
</PRE>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> that if column <CODE>b</CODE> is unique too, the
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> command would be written as


<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE table SET c=c+1 WHERE a=1 OR b=2 LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

and if <CODE>a=1 OR b=2</CODE> matches several rows, only <STRONG>one</STRONG> row
will be updated! In general, one should try to avoid using
<CODE>ON DUPLICATE KEY</CODE> clause on tables with multiple <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.

When one uses <CODE>ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE</CODE>,
the <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option is ignored.

<LI>

If MySQL was configured using the <CODE>DONT_USE_DEFAULT_FIELDS</CODE>
option, <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements generate an error unless you explicitly
specify values for all columns that require a non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

You can find the value used for an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column

INSERT DELAYED ...
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement is a
MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients
that can't wait for the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> to complete.  This is a common
problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also
periodically run <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that take a
long time to complete.  <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> was introduced in MySQL
Version 3.22.15.  It is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> only works with <CODE>ISAM</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables.  Note that as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables supports concurrent
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, if there is no free blocks in the
middle of the datafile, you very seldom need to use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>, the client will get an OK at once
and the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by any other thread.

</P>
<P>
Another major benefit of using <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is that inserts
from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much
faster than doing many separate inserts.

</P>
<P>
Note that currently the queued rows are only stored in memory until they are
inserted into the table.  This means that if you kill <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
the hard way (<CODE>kill -9</CODE>) or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly, any
queued rows that weren't written to disk are lost!

</P>
<P>
The following describes in detail what happens when you use the
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> option to <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>.  In this
description, the ``thread'' is the thread that received an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command and ``handler'' is the thread that handles all
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> statements for a particular table.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

When a thread executes a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statement for a table, a handler
thread is created to process all <CODE>DELAYED</CODE> statements for the table, if
no such handler already exists.

<LI>

The thread checks whether the handler has acquired a <CODE>DELAYED</CODE>
lock already; if not, it tells the handler thread to do so.  The
<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> lock can be obtained even if other threads have a <CODE>READ</CODE>
or <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock on the table.  However, the handler will wait for all
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> locks or <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> to ensure that the table
structure is up to date.

<LI>

The thread executes the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement, but instead of writing
the row to the table, it puts a copy of the final row into a queue that
is managed by the handler thread. Any syntax errors are noticed by the
thread and reported to the client program.

<LI>

The client can't report the number of duplicates or the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
value for the resulting row; it can't obtain them from the server, because
the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> returns before the insert operation has been completed.  If
you use the C API, the <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> function doesn't return anything
meaningful, for the same reason.

<LI>

The update log is updated by the handler thread when the row is inserted into
the table.  In case of multiple-row inserts, the update log is updated when
the first row is inserted.

<LI>

After every <CODE>delayed_insert_limit</CODE> rows are written, the handler checks
whether any <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements are still pending.  If so, it
allows these to execute before continuing.

<A NAME="IDX1433"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1434"></A>
<LI>

When the handler has no more rows in its queue, the table is unlocked.  If no
new <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands are received within
<CODE>delayed_insert_timeout</CODE> seconds, the handler terminates.

<LI>

If more than <CODE>delayed_queue_size</CODE> rows are pending already in a
specific handler queue, the thread requesting <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
waits until there is room in the queue.  This is done to ensure that
the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't use all memory for the delayed memory
queue.

<LI>

The handler thread will show up in the MySQL process list
with <CODE>delayed_insert</CODE> in the <CODE>Command</CODE> column.  It will
be killed if you execute a <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> command or kill it with
<CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>. However, it will first store all queued rows into the
table before exiting. During this time it will not accept any new
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands from another thread. If you execute an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> command after this, a new handler thread will be created.

Note that the above means that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> commands have higher
priority than normal <CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands if there is an <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> handler already running!  Other update commands will have to wait
until the <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> queue is empty, someone kills the handler
thread (with <CODE>KILL thread_id</CODE>), or someone executes <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.

<LI>

The following status variables provide information about <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> commands:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Variable</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_insert_threads</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of handler threads
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Delayed_writes</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows written with <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>Not_flushed_delayed_rows</CODE> </TD><TD> Number of rows waiting to be written
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

You can view these variables by issuing a <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE> statement or
by executing a <CODE>mysqladmin extended-status</CODE> command.
</UL>

<P>
Note that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is slower than a normal INSERT if the
table is not in use.  There is also the additional overhead for the
server to handle a separate thread for each table on which you use
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This means that you should only use <CODE>INSERT
DELAYED</CODE> when you are really sure you need it!

</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> updates columns in existing table rows with new values.
The <CODE>SET</CODE> clause indicates which columns to modify and the values
they should be given.  The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, if given, specifies
which rows should be updated.  Otherwise, all rows are updated. If the
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is specified, the rows will be updated in the
order that is specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, the update statement will not
abort even if we get duplicate key errors during the update.  Rows that
would cause conflicts will not be updated.

</P>
<P>
If you access a column from <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> in an expression,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> uses the current value of the column.  For example, the
following statement sets the <CODE>age</CODE> column to one more than its
current value:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> assignments are evaluated from left to right.  For example, the
following statement doubles the <CODE>age</CODE> column, then increments it:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; UPDATE persondata SET age=age*2, age=age+1;
</PRE>

<P>
If you set a column to the value it currently has, MySQL notices
this and doesn't update it.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1436"></A>
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> returns the number of rows that were actually changed.
In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
returns the number of rows that were matched and updated and the number of
warnings that occurred during the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23, you can use <CODE>LIMIT #</CODE> to ensure that
only a given number of rows are changed.

</P>

Starting with MySQL Version 4.0.4, you can also perform <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
operations that cover multiple tables:

<PRE>
UPDATE items,month SET items.price=month.price

<P>
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> deletes rows from <CODE>table_name</CODE> that satisfy the condition
given by <CODE>where_definition</CODE>, and returns the number of records deleted.

</P>
<P>
If you issue a <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, all rows are
deleted.  If you do this in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, this works as
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TRUNCATE">6.4.7  <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> Syntax</A>.  In MySQL 3.23,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause will return zero as the number
of affected records.

</P>
<P>
If you really want to know how many records are deleted when you are deleting
all rows, and are willing to suffer a speed penalty, you can use a
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement of this form:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; DELETE FROM table_name WHERE 1&#62;0;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this is much slower than <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> with no
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, because it deletes rows one at a time.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the word <CODE>QUICK</CODE> then the storage engine will not
merge index leaves during delete, which may speed up certain kind of
deletes.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, deleted records are maintained in a linked list and
subsequent <CODE>INSERT</CODE> operations reuse old record positions. To
reclaim unused space and reduce file-sizes, use the <CODE>OPTIMIZE
TABLE</CODE> statement or the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> utility to reorganise tables.
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> is easier, but <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> is faster.  See
section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> and section <A HREF="manual.html#Optimisation">4.4.6.10  Table Optimisation</A>.

</P>
<P>
The first multi-table delete format is supported starting from MySQL 4.0.0.
The second multi-table delete format is supported starting from MySQL 4.0.2.

</P>
<P>
The idea is that only matching rows from the tables listed
<STRONG>before</STRONG> the <CODE>FROM</CODE> or before the <CODE>USING</CODE> clause are
deleted. The effect is that you can delete rows from many tables at the
same time and also have additional tables that are used for searching.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>.*</CODE> after the table names is there just to be compatible with
<CODE>Access</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
DELETE t1,t2 FROM t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id

or

DELETE FROM t1,t2 USING t1,t2,t3 WHERE t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id
</PRE>

<P>
In the above case we delete matching rows just from tables <CODE>t1</CODE> and
<CODE>t2</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clause is used (available from MySQL 4.0), the rows
will be deleted in that order. This is really only useful in conjunction
with <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
DELETE FROM somelog
WHERE user = 'jcole'
ORDER BY timestamp
LIMIT 1
</PRE>

<P>
This will delete the oldest entry (by <CODE>timestamp</CODE>) where the row matches
the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL-specific <CODE>LIMIT rows</CODE> option to <CODE>DELETE</CODE> tells
the server the maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is
returned to the client.  This can be used to ensure that a specific
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> command doesn't take too much time.  You can simply repeat
the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> command until the number of affected rows is less than
the <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
From MySQL 4.0, you can specify multiple tables in the <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
statement to delete rows from one table depending on a particular condition
in multiple tables. However, you can not use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>
in a multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE>.

<P>
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> works exactly like <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, except that if an old
record in the table has the same value as a new record on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
index or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, the old record is deleted before the new
record is inserted.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
In other words, you can't access the values of the old row from a
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> statement.  In some old MySQL versions it appeared that
you could do this, but that was a bug that has been corrected.

</P>
<P>
To be able to use <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> you must have <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges for the table.

</P>
<P>
When you use a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>
will return 2 if the new row replaced an old row.  This is because
one row was inserted after the duplicate was deleted.

</P>
<P>
This fact makes it easy to determine whether <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> added
or replaced a row: check whether the affected-rows value is 1 (added)
or 2 (replaced).

</P>
<P>
Note that unless you use a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>,
using a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command makes no sense, since it would just do
an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>.

    [LINES TERMINATED BY '\n']
    [IGNORE number LINES]
    [(col_name,...)]
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement reads rows from a text file into a
table at a very high speed.  If the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> keyword is specified, the
file is read from the client host.  If <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is not specified, the
file must be located on the server.  (<CODE>LOCAL</CODE> is available in
MySQL Version 3.22.6 or later.)

</P>
<P>
For security reasons, when reading text files located on the server, the
files must either reside in the database directory or be readable by all.
Also, to use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on server files, you must have the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege on the server host.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Privileges_provided">4.2.7  Privileges Provided by MySQL</A>.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 3.23.49 and MySQL 4.0.2 <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> will only work if you have
not started <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--local-infile=0</CODE> or if you
have not enabled your client to support <CODE>LOCAL</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA_LOCAL">4.2.4  Security issues with LOAD DATA LOCAL</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>, execution of the
<CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement is delayed until no other clients are reading
from the table.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the keyword <CODE>CONCURRENT</CODE> with a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
then other threads can retrieve data from the table while <CODE>LOAD
DATA</CODE> is executing. Using this option will of course affect the
performance of <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> a bit even if no other thread is using
the table at the same time.

</P>
<P>
Using <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> will be a bit slower than letting the server access the
files directly, because the contents of the file must travel from the client
host to the server host.  On the other hand, you do not need the
<CODE>FILE</CODE> privilege to load local files.

</P>
<P>
If you are using MySQL before Version 3.23.24 you can't read from a
FIFO with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.  If you need to read from a FIFO (for
example the output from gunzip), use <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE>
instead.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1441"></A>
You can also load datafiles by using the <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> utility; it
operates by sending a <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> command to the server.  The
<CODE>--local</CODE> option causes <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> to read datafiles from the
client host.  You can specify the <CODE>--compress</CODE> option to get better
performance over slow networks if the client and server support the
compressed protocol.

</P>
<P>
When locating files on the server host, the server uses the following rules:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If an absolute pathname is given, the server uses the pathname as is.

<LI>

If a relative pathname with one or more leading components is given,
the server searches for the file relative to the server's data directory.

<LI>

If a filename with no leading components is given, the server looks for
the file in the database directory of the current database.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these rules mean a file given as <TT>`./myfile.txt'</TT> is read from
the server's data directory, whereas a file given as <TT>`myfile.txt'</TT> is
read from the database directory of the current database.  For example,
the following <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> statement reads the file <TT>`data.txt'</TT>
from the database directory for <CODE>db1</CODE> because <CODE>db1</CODE> is the current
database, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a
table in the <CODE>db2</CODE> database:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; USE db1;
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "data.txt" INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> and <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> keywords control handling of input
records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  If you specify
<CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, new rows replace existing rows that have the same unique key
value. If you specify <CODE>IGNORE</CODE>, input rows that duplicate an existing
row on a unique key value are skipped.  If you don't specify either option, an
error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text
file is ignored.

</P>
<P>
If you load data from a local file using the <CODE>LOCAL</CODE> keyword, the server
has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the operation,
so the default behaviour is the same as if <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is specified.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on an empty <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
all non-unique indexes are created in a separate batch (like in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).
This normally makes <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> much faster when you have many
indexes.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> is the complement of <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SELECT">6.4.1  <CODE>SELECT</CODE> Syntax</A>.
To write data from a database to a file, use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
To read the file back into the database, use <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>.
The syntax of the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> clauses is the same for
both commands.  Both clauses are optional, but <CODE>FIELDS</CODE>
must precede <CODE>LINES</CODE> if both are specified.

</P>
<P>
If you specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause,
each of its subclauses (<CODE>TERMINATED BY</CODE>, <CODE>[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED
BY</CODE>, and <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>) is also optional, except that you must
specify at least one of them.

</P>
<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause, the defaults are the
same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't specify a <CODE>LINES</CODE> clause, the default
is the same as if you had written this:

</P>

<PRE>
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
</PRE>

<P>
In other words, the defaults cause <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to act as follows
when reading input:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Look for line boundaries at newlines.

<LI>

Break lines into fields at tabs.

<LI>

Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Interpret occurrences of tab, newline, or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> preceded by
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> as literal characters that are part of field values.
</UL>

<P>
Conversely, the defaults cause <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to act as
follows when writing output:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Write tabs between fields.

<LI>

Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.

<LI>

Use <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> to escape instances of tab, newline or <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> that occur
within field values.

<LI>

Write newlines at the ends of lines.
</UL>

<P>
Note that to write <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\\'</CODE>, you must specify two
backslashes for the value to be read as a single backslash.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>IGNORE number LINES</CODE> option can be used to ignore a header of
column names at the start of the file:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/file_name" INTO TABLE test IGNORE 1 LINES;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> in tandem with <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to write data from a database into a file and then read
the file back into the database later, the field and line handling
options for both commands must match.  Otherwise, <CODE>LOAD DATA
INFILE</CODE> will not interpret the contents of the file properly.  Suppose
you use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> to write a file with
fields delimited by commas:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
    -&#62;          FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    -&#62;          FROM ...;
</PRE>

<P>
To read the comma-delimited file back in, the correct statement would be:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
</PRE>

<P>
If instead you tried to read in the file with the statement shown here, it
wouldn't work because it instructs <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> to look for
tabs between fields:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
</PRE>

<P>
The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as
a single field.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> can be used to read files obtained from
external sources, too. For example, a file in dBASE format will have
fields separated by commas and enclosed in double quotes.  If lines in
the file are terminated by newlines, the command shown here
illustrates the field and line handling options you would use to load
the file:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
    -&#62;           FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
    -&#62;           LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
</PRE>

<P>
Any of the field or line handling options may specify an empty string
(<CODE>''</CODE>).  If not empty, the <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
and <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> values must be a single character.  The
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values may
be more than one character.  For example, to write lines that are
terminated by carriage return-linefeed pairs, or to read a file
containing such lines, specify a <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'</CODE>
clause.

</P>
<P>
For example, to read a file of jokes, that are separated with a line
of <CODE>%%</CODE>, into a SQL table you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE jokes (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, joke TEXT
NOT NULL);
LOAD DATA INFILE "/tmp/jokes.txt" INTO TABLE jokes FIELDS TERMINATED BY ""
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n%%\n" (joke);
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> controls quoting of fields.  For
output (<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE>), if you omit the word
<CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, all fields are enclosed by the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
character.  An example of such output (using a comma as the field
delimiter) is shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
</PRE>

<P>
If you specify <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE>, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character is
used only to enclose <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> fields:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
Note that occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character within a
field value are escaped by prefixing them with the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
character.  Also note that if you specify an empty <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE>
value, it is possible to generate output that cannot be read properly by
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>. For example, the output just shown above would
appear as shown here if the escape character is empty.  Observe that the
second field in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which
(erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

</P>

<PRE>
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
</PRE>

<P>
For input, the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character, if present, is stripped from the
ends of field values.  (This is true whether <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE> is
specified; <CODE>OPTIONALLY</CODE> has no effect on input interpretation.)
Occurrences of the <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character preceded by the
<CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character are interpreted as part of the current field
value.  In addition, duplicated <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> characters occurring
within fields are interpreted as single <CODE>ENCLOSED BY</CODE> characters if the
field itself starts with that character.  For example, if <CODE>ENCLOSED BY
'"'</CODE> is specified, quotes are handled as shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -&#62; The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -&#62; The ""BIG"" boss
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> controls how to write or read special characters.
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, it is used to prefix
the following characters on output:

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The <CODE>FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY</CODE> character
<LI>

The first character of the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> values
<LI>

ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (what is actually written following the escape character is
ASCII <CODE>'0'</CODE>, not a zero-valued byte)
</UL>

<P>
If the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is empty, no characters are escaped.
It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character,
particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters in
the list just given.

</P>
<P>
For input, if the <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> character is not empty, occurrences
of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally
as part of a field value.  The exceptions are an escaped <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`N'</SAMP> (for example, <CODE>\0</CODE> or <CODE>\N</CODE> if the escape character is
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  These sequences are interpreted as ASCII <CODE>0</CODE> (a zero-valued
byte) and <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  See below for the rules on <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling.

</P>
<P>
For more information about <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-escape syntax,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>.

</P>
<P>
In certain cases, field and line handling options interact:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE> is an empty string and <CODE>FIELDS
TERMINATED BY</CODE> is non-empty, lines are also terminated with
<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE>.
<LI>

If the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> values are
both empty (<CODE>''</CODE>), a fixed-row (non-delimited) format is used.  With
fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields. Instead, column
values are written and read using the ``display'' widths of the columns.  For
example, if a column is declared as <CODE>INT(7)</CODE>, values for the column are
written using 7-character fields.  On input, values for the column are
obtained by reading 7 characters.  Fixed-row format also affects handling of
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values; see below.  Note that fixed-size format will not work
if you are using a multi-byte character set.
</UL>

<P>
Handling of <CODE>NULL</CODE> values varies, depending on the <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> options you use:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For the default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and <CODE>LINES</CODE> values,
<CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as <CODE>\N</CODE> for output and <CODE>\N</CODE> is read
as <CODE>NULL</CODE> for input (assuming the <CODE>ESCAPED BY</CODE> character
is <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> is not empty, a field containing the literal
word <CODE>NULL</CODE> as its value is read as a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value (this differs
from the word <CODE>NULL</CODE> enclosed within <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE>
characters, which is read as the string <CODE>'NULL'</CODE>).

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as the word
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<LI>

With fixed-row format (which happens when <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and
<CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> are both empty), <CODE>NULL</CODE> is written as an empty
string.  Note that this causes both <CODE>NULL</CODE> values and empty strings in
the table to be indistinguishable when written to the file because they are
both written as empty strings.  If you need to be able to tell the two apart
when reading the file back in, you should not use fixed-row format.
</UL>

<P>
Some cases are not supported by <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>:

<UL>

<LI>

Fixed-size rows (<CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> and <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED
BY</CODE> both empty) and <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

<LI>

If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of another,
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> won't be able to interpret the input properly.
For example, the following <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> clause would cause problems:


<PRE>
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
</PRE>

<LI>

If <CODE>FIELDS ESCAPED BY</CODE> is empty, a field value that contains an occurrence
of <CODE>FIELDS ENCLOSED BY</CODE> or <CODE>LINES TERMINATED BY</CODE>
followed by the <CODE>FIELDS TERMINATED BY</CODE> value will cause <CODE>LOAD
DATA INFILE</CODE> to stop reading a field or line too early.
This happens because <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> cannot properly determine
where the field or line value ends.
</UL>

<P>
The following example loads all columns of the <CODE>persondata</CODE> table:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
</PRE>

<P>
No field list is specified, so <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> expects input rows
to contain a field for each table column.  The default <CODE>FIELDS</CODE> and
<CODE>LINES</CODE> values are used.

</P>
<P>
If you wish to load only some of a table's columns, specify a field list:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt'
    -&#62;           INTO TABLE persondata (col1,col2,...);
</PRE>

<P>
You must also specify a field list if the order of the fields in the input
file differs from the order of the columns in the table.  Otherwise,
MySQL cannot tell how to match up input fields with table columns.

</P>
<P>
If a row has too few fields, the columns for which no input field is present
are set to default values.  Default value assignment is described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
An empty field value is interpreted differently than if the field value
is missing:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For string types, the column is set to the empty string.

<LI>

For numeric types, the column is set to <CODE>0</CODE>.

<LI>

For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate ``zero''
value for the type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these are the same values that result if you assign an empty
string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly
in an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns are only set to the current date and time if there
is a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value for the column, or (for the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column only) if the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column is left out from the field list
when a field list is specified.

</P>
<P>
If an input row has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and
the number of warnings is incremented.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> regards all input as strings, so you can't use
numeric values for <CODE>ENUM</CODE> or <CODE>SET</CODE> columns the way you can with
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  All <CODE>ENUM</CODE> and <CODE>SET</CODE> values must be
specified as strings!

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1442"></A>
If you are using the C API, you can get information about the query by
calling the API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> when the <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>
query finishes.  The format of the information string is shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
</PRE>

<P>
Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted
via the <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statement (see section <A HREF="manual.html#INSERT">6.4.3  <CODE>INSERT</CODE> Syntax</A>), except
that <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> also generates warnings when there are too few
or too many fields in the input row.  The warnings are not stored anywhere;
the number of warnings can only be used as an indication if everything went
well.  If you get warnings and want to know exactly why you got them, one way
to do this is to use <CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE</CODE> into another file and
compare this to your original input file.

</P>
<P>
If you need <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> to read from a pipe, you can use the
following trick:

cat &#60; /dev/tcp/10.1.1.12/4711 &#62; /nt/mysql/db/x/x

<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
creates a table with the given name in the current database.  Rules for
allowable table names are given in section <A HREF="manual.html#Legal_names">6.1.2  Database, Table, Index, Column, and Alias Names</A>.  An error occurs if
there is no current database or if the table already exists.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, the table name can be specified as
<CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE>.  This works regardless of whether there is a
current database.

</P>
<P>
From MySQL Version 3.23, you can use the <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> keyword when
you create a table. The name is restricted to the current connection, and
the temporary table will automatically be deleted when the connection is closed.
This means that two different
connections can both use the same temporary table name without conflicting
with each other or with an existing table of the same name. (The existing table
is hidden until the temporary table is deleted.).  From MySQL 4.0.2 one must
have the <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE> privilege to be able to create
temporary tables.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23 or later, you can use the keywords
<CODE>IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> so that an error does not occur if the table already
exists.  Note that there is no verification that the table structures are
identical.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 4.1 you can use <CODE>LIKE</CODE> to create a table based on a table
definition in another table.  In MySQL 4.1 you can also specify the
type for a generated column:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE foo (a tinyint not null) SELECT b+1 AS 'a' FROM bar;
</PRE>

<P>
Each table <CODE>tbl_name</CODE> is represented by some files in the database
directory. In the case of MyISAM-type tables you will get:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

</TABLE>

<P>
For more information on the properties of the various column types, see
section <A HREF="manual.html#Column_types">6.2  Column Types</A>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If neither <CODE>NULL</CODE> nor <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> is specified, the column
is treated as though <CODE>NULL</CODE> had been specified.

<LI>

An integer column may have the additional attribute <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>.
When you insert a value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> (recommended) or <CODE>0</CODE> into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the column is set to <CODE>value+1</CODE>, where
<CODE>value</CODE> is the largest value for the column currently in the table.
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> sequences begin with <CODE>1</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

If you delete the row containing the maximum value for an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the value will be reused with an
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>, or <CODE>BDB</CODE> table but not with a
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table.  If you delete all rows in the table
with <CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> (without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>) in
<CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode, the sequence starts over for all table types.

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: there can be only one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column per
table, and it must be indexed. MySQL Version 3.23 will also only
work properly if the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column only has positive
values. Inserting a negative number is regarded as inserting a very large
positive number.  This is done to avoid precision problems when
numbers 'wrap' over from positive to negative and also to ensure that one
doesn't accidentally get an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column that contains 0.

In MyISAM and BDB tables you can specify <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> secondary
column in a multi-column key.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#example-AUTO_INCREMENT">3.5.9  Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX1451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
To make MySQL compatible with some ODBC applications, you can find
the last inserted row with the following query:


<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto_col IS NULL
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> automatically commits the current InnoDB
transaction if MySQL binary logging is used.

<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled differently for <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns than
for other column types.  You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting the column to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the
current date and time.  Because <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the
<CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> attributes do not apply in the normal way and
are ignored if you specify them.

On the other hand, to make it easier for MySQL clients to use
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns, the server reports that such columns may be
assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (which is true), even though <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
never actually will contain a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  You can see this when you
use <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> to get a description of your table.

Note that setting a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to <CODE>0</CODE> is not the same
as setting it to <CODE>NULL</CODE>, because <CODE>0</CODE> is a valid <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
value.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
A <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value has to be a constant, it cannot be a function or
an expression.

If no <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value is specified for a column, MySQL
automatically assigns one, as follows.

If the column may take <CODE>NULL</CODE> as a value, the default value is
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

If the column is declared as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, the default value depends on
the column type:


<UL>
<LI>

For numeric types other than those declared with the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
attribute, the default is <CODE>0</CODE>.  For an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the
default value is the next value in the sequence.

<LI>

For date and time types other than <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, the default is the
appropriate zero value for the type.  For the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column in a table, the default value is the current date and time.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Date_and_time_types">6.2.2  Date and Time Types</A>.

<LI>

For string types other than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default value is the empty
string.  For <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, the default is the first enumeration value.
</UL>

Default values must be constants. This means, for example, that you cannot
set the default for a date column to be the value of a function such as
<CODE>NOW()</CODE> or <CODE>CURRENT_DATE</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>KEY</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>INDEX</CODE>.

<LI>

In MySQL, a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key can have only distinct values. An
error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key that matches an existing
row.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1454"></A>
A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is a unique <CODE>KEY</CODE> with the extra constraint
that all key columns must be defined as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.  In MySQL
the key is named <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE>. A table can have only one <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.
If you don't have a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> and some applications ask for the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in your tables, MySQL will return the first
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key, which doesn't have any <CODE>NULL</CODE> columns, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>.

<LI>

A <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> can be a multiple-column index.  However, you cannot
create a multiple-column index using the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> key attibute in a
column specification.  Doing so will mark only that single column as primary.
You must use the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY(index_col_name, ...)</CODE> syntax.

<LI>

If the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> or <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key consists of only one column and this
is of type integer, you can also refer to it as <CODE>_rowid</CODE>
(new in Version 3.23.11).

<LI>

If you don't assign a name to an index, the index will be assigned the same
name as the first <CODE>index_col_name</CODE>, with an optional suffix (<CODE>_2</CODE>,
<CODE>_3</CODE>, <CODE>...</CODE>) to make it unique.  You can see index names for a
table using <CODE>SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_DATABASE_INFO">4.5.6.1  Retrieving information about Database, Tables, Columns, and Indexes</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1455"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1456"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>, and <CODE>BDB</CODE> table types support indexes on columns that can have
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values. In other cases you must declare such columns
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> or an error results.

<LI>

With <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax, you can specify an index that
uses only a part of a <CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column. This can
make the index file much smaller.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Indexes">5.4.4  Column Indexes</A>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1458"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1460"></A>
Only the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports indexing on <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.  When putting an index on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE>
column you MUST always specify the length of the index:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE test (blob_col BLOB, INDEX(blob_col(10)));
</PRE>

<LI>

When you use <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> with a <CODE>TEXT</CODE> or
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> column, only the first <CODE>max_sort_length</CODE> bytes are used.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#BLOB">6.2.3.2  The <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> Types</A>.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.23.23 or later, you can also create special
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They are used for full-text search. Only the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table type supports <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes. They can be created
only from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
Indexing always happens over the entire column; partial indexing is not
supported. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A> for details of operation.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.23.44 or later, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables support checking of
foreign key constraints. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>. Note that the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> syntax in InnoDB is more restricted than
the syntax presented above. InnoDB does not allow
<CODE>index_name</CODE> to be specified, and the columns of the referenced
table always have to be explicitly named. Starting from
4.0.8 InnoDB supports both <CODE>ON DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>ON UPDATE</CODE>
actions on foreign keys.
See the InnoDB manual section for the precise syntax. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>.
For other table types, MySQL Server does parse the <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>,
<CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> syntax in <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> commands,
but without further action being taken. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANSI_diff_Foreign_Keys">1.7.4.5  Foreign Keys</A>.

<LI>

Each <CODE>NULL</CODE> column takes one bit extra, rounded up to the nearest byte.

<LI>

The maximum record length in bytes can be calculated as follows:


<PRE>
row length = 1
             + (sum of column lengths)
             + (number of NULL columns + 7)/8
             + (number of variable-length columns)
</PRE>

<LI>

The <CODE>table_options</CODE> and <CODE>SELECT</CODE> options are only
implemented in MySQL Version 3.23 and above.

The different table types are:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Table type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>BDB or BerkeleyDB </TD><TD> Transaction-safe tables with page locking. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.6  <CODE>BDB</CODE> or <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> Tables</A>.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

If a table type is specified, and that particular type is not available,
MySQL will choose the closest table type to the one that you have
specified.  For example, if <CODE>TYPE=BDB</CODE> is specified, and that distribution
of MySQL does not support <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, the table will be created
as <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> instead.

The other table options are used to optimise the behaviour of the
table. In most cases, you don't have to specify any of them.
The options work for all table types, if not otherwise indicated:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> The next <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value you want to set for your table (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> </TD><TD> An approximation of the average row length for your table. You only need to set this for large tables with variable size records.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CHECKSUM</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want MySQL to maintain a checksum for all rows (makes the table a little slower to update but makes it easier to find corrupted tables) (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>COMMENT</CODE> </TD><TD> A 60-character comment for your table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Max number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>MIN_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Minimum number of rows you plan to store in the table.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if you want to have a smaller index. This usually makes updates slower and reads faster (MyISAM, ISAM). Setting this to 0 will disable all packing of keys. Setting this to <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> (MySQL 4.0) will tell the storage engine to only pack long <CODE>CHAR</CODE>/<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>PASSWORD</CODE> </TD><TD> Encrypt the <TT>`.frm'</TT> file with a password.  This option doesn't do anything in the standard MySQL version.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>DELAY_KEY_WRITE</CODE> </TD><TD> Set this to 1 if want to delay key table updates until the table is closed (MyISAM).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>ROW_FORMAT</CODE> </TD><TD> Defines how the rows should be stored. Currently this option only works with MyISAM tables, which supports the <CODE>DYNAMIC</CODE> and <CODE>FIXED</CODE> row formats. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A>.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

When you use a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, MySQL uses the product of
<CODE>max_rows * avg_row_length</CODE> to decide how big the resulting table
will be.  If you don't specify any of the above options, the maximum size
for a table will be 4G (or 2G if your operating systems only supports 2G
tables). The reason for this is just to keep down the pointer sizes
to make the index smaller and faster if you don't really need big files.

If you don't use <CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE>, the default is to only pack strings,
not numbers.  If you use <CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE>, numbers will be packed as well.

When packing binary number keys, MySQL will use prefix compression.
This means that you will only get a big benefit of this if you have
many numbers that are the same.  Prefix compression means that every
key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the previous key are
the same for the next key (note that the pointer to the row is stored
in high-byte-first-order directly after the key, to improve
compression).  This means that if you have many equal keys on two rows
in a row, all following 'same' keys will usually only take 2 bytes
(including the pointer to the row).  Compare this to the ordinary case
where the following keys will take storage_size_for_key +
pointer_size (usually 4).  On the other hand, if all keys are
totally different, you will lose 1 byte per key, if the key isn't a
key that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE> values. (In this case the packed key length will
be stored in the same byte that is used to mark if a key is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.)

<LI>

If you specify a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> after the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement,
MySQL will create new fields for all elements in the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    -&#62;        PRIMARY KEY (a), KEY(b))
    -&#62;        TYPE=MyISAM SELECT b,c FROM test2;
</PRE>

This will create a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table with three columns, a, b, and c.
Notice that the columns from the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement are appended to
the right side of the table, not overlapped onto it.  Take the following
example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM foo;
+---+
| n |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+

mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE bar (m INT) SELECT n FROM foo;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM bar;
+------+---+
| m    | n |
+------+---+
| NULL | 1 |
+------+---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

For each row in table <CODE>foo</CODE>, a row is inserted in <CODE>bar</CODE> with
the values from <CODE>foo</CODE> and default values for the new columns.

<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</CODE> will not automatically create any indexes
for you.  This is done intentionally to make the command as flexible as
possible.  If you want to have indexes in the created table, you should
specify these before the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE bar (UNIQUE (n)) SELECT n FROM foo;
</PRE>

If any errors occur while copying the data to the table, it will
automatically be deleted.

To ensure that the update log/binary log can be used to re-create the
original tables, MySQL will not allow concurrent inserts during
<CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</CODE>.

The <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> option will help you to break the 2G/4G limit for
the MyISAM datafile (not the index file) on operating systems that
don't support big files. Note that this option is not recommended for
filesystem that supports big files!

You can get more speed from the I/O bottleneck by putting <CODE>RAID</CODE>
directories on different physical disks. <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> will work on
any OS, as long as you have configured MySQL with <CODE>--with-raid</CODE>.
For now the only allowed <CODE>RAID_TYPE</CODE> is <CODE>STRIPED</CODE> (<CODE>1</CODE>
and <CODE>RAID0</CODE> are aliases for this).

If you specify <CODE>RAID_TYPE=STRIPED</CODE> for a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table,
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create <CODE>RAID_CHUNKS</CODE> subdirectories named 00,
01, 02 in the database directory.  In each of these directories
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will create a <CODE>table_name.MYD</CODE>.  When writing data
to the datafile, the <CODE>RAID</CODE> handler will map the first
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the first file, the next
<CODE>RAID_CHUNKSIZE</CODE> *1024 bytes to the next file and so on.
<LI>

<CODE>UNION</CODE> is used when you want to use a collection of identical
tables as one. This only works with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.

For the moment you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
All mapped tables must be in the same database as the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

<LI>

If you want to insert data in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you have to specify with
<CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> into with table the row should be inserted.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.  This option was introduced in MySQL 4.0.0.

<LI>

In the created table the <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> key will be placed first, followed
by all <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys and then the normal keys.  This helps the
MySQL optimiser to prioritise which key to use and also more quickly
detect duplicated <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.

<LI>

By using <CODE>DATA DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> or <CODE>INDEX
DIRECTORY="directory"</CODE> you can specify where the storage engine should
put it's table and index files.  Note that the directory should be a full
path to the directory (not relative path).

This only works for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables in <CODE>MySQL</CODE> 4.0, when you
are not using the <CODE>--skip-symlink</CODE> option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Symbolic_links_to_tables">5.6.1.2  Using Symbolic Links for Tables</A>.

<P>
In some cases, MySQL silently changes a column specification from
that given in a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> statement.  (This may also occur with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns with a length less than four are changed to
<CODE>CHAR</CODE>.

<LI>

If any column in a table has a variable length, the entire row is
variable-length as a result.  Therefore, if a table contains any
variable-length columns (<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>TEXT</CODE>, or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>),
all <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns longer than three characters are changed to
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.  This doesn't affect how you use the columns in
any way; in MySQL, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> is just a different way to
store characters.  MySQL performs this conversion because it
saves space and makes table operations faster.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Table_types">7  MySQL Table Types</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> display sizes must be even and in the range from 2 to 14.
If you specify a display size of 0 or greater than 14, the size is coerced
to 14.  Odd-valued sizes in the range from 1 to 13 are coerced
to the next higher even number.

<LI>

You cannot store a literal <CODE>NULL</CODE> in a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column; setting
it to <CODE>NULL</CODE> sets it to the current date and time.  Because
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> columns behave this way, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> and <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>
attributes do not apply in the normal way and are ignored if you specify
them.  <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> always reports that a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column may be assigned <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.

<LI>

MySQL maps certain column types used by other SQL database vendors
to MySQL types.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Other-vendor_column_types">6.2.5  Using Column Types from Other Database Engines</A>.
</UL>

<P>
If you want to see whether MySQL used a column type other
than the one you specified, issue a <CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> statement after
creating or altering your table.

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> allows you to change the structure of an existing table.
For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change
the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself.  You can
also change the comment for the table and type of the table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to change a column specification but
<CODE>DESCRIBE tbl_name</CODE> indicates that your column was not changed, it is
possible that MySQL ignored your modification for one of the reasons
described in section <A HREF="manual.html#Silent_column_changes">6.5.3.1  Silent Column Specification Changes</A>.  For example, if you try to change
a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column to <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, MySQL will still use
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> if the table contains other variable-length columns.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works by making a temporary copy of the original table.
The alteration is performed on the copy, then the original table is
deleted and the new one is renamed. This is done in such a way that
all updates are automatically redirected to the new table without
any failed updates. While <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> is executing, the original
table is readable by other clients. Updates and writes to the table
are stalled until the new table is ready.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you use any other option to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> than
<CODE>RENAME</CODE>, MySQL will always create a temporary table, even
if the data wouldn't strictly need to be copied (like when you change the
name of a column). We plan to fix this in the future, but as one doesn't
normally do <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> that often this isn't that high on our TODO.
For MyISAM tables, you can speed up the index recreation part (which is the
slowest part of the recreation process) by setting the
<CODE>myisam_sort_buffer_size</CODE> variable to a high value.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, you need <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
and <CODE>CREATE</CODE> privileges on the table.

<LI>

<CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.
It controls how <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works if there are duplicates on
unique keys in the new table.
If <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> isn't specified, the copy is aborted and rolled back.
If <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> is specified, then for rows with duplicates on a unique
key, only the first row is used; the others are deleted.

<LI>

You can issue multiple <CODE>ADD</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE>, <CODE>DROP</CODE>, and
<CODE>CHANGE</CODE> clauses in a single <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement. This is a
MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92, which allows only one of each clause
per <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE col_name</CODE>, <CODE>DROP col_name</CODE>, and <CODE>DROP
INDEX</CODE> are MySQL extensions to ANSI SQL92.

<LI>

<CODE>MODIFY</CODE> is an Oracle extension to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.

<LI>

The optional word <CODE>COLUMN</CODE> is a pure noise word and can be omitted.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE tbl_name RENAME TO new_name</CODE> without any other
options, MySQL simply renames the files that correspond to the table
<CODE>tbl_name</CODE>.  There is no need to create the temporary table.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#RENAME_TABLE">6.5.5  <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

<CODE>create_definition</CODE> clauses use the same syntax for <CODE>ADD</CODE> and
<CODE>CHANGE</CODE> as for <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.  Note that this syntax includes
the column name, not just the column type.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

You can rename a column using a <CODE>CHANGE old_col_name create_definition</CODE>
clause.  To do so, specify the old and new column names and the type that
the column currently has.  For example, to rename an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> column
from <CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>b</CODE>, you can do this:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b INTEGER;
</PRE>

If you want to change a column's type but not the name, <CODE>CHANGE</CODE>
syntax still requires two column names even if they are the same.  For
example:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

However, as of MySQL Version 3.22.16a, you can also use <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>
to change a column's type without renaming it:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b BIGINT NOT NULL;
</PRE>

<LI>

If you use <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE> to shorten a column for which
an index exists on part of the column (for instance, if you have an index
on the first 10 characters of a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column), you cannot make
the column shorter than the number of characters that are indexed.

<LI>

When you change a column type using <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>,
MySQL tries to convert data to the new type as well as possible.

<LI>

In MySQL Version 3.22 or later, you can use <CODE>FIRST</CODE> or
<CODE>ADD ... AFTER col_name</CODE> to add a column at a specific position
within a table row. The default is to add the column last.
From MySQL Version 4.0.1, you can also use the <CODE>FIRST</CODE> and
<CODE>AFTER</CODE> keywords in <CODE>CHANGE</CODE> or <CODE>MODIFY</CODE>.

<CODE>ALTER COLUMN</CODE> specifies a new default value for a column
or removes the old default value.
If the old default is removed and the column can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the new
default is <CODE>NULL</CODE>. If the column cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, MySQL
assigns a default value, as described in
section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> removes an index. This is a MySQL extension to
ANSI SQL92. See section <A HREF="manual.html#DROP_INDEX">6.5.8  <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>

If columns are dropped from a table, the columns are also removed from any
index of which they are a part.  If all columns that make up an index are
dropped, the index is dropped as well.

<LI>

If a table contains only one column, the column cannot be dropped.
If what you intend is to remove the table, use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> instead.

<A NAME="IDX1474"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1475"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1476"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP PRIMARY KEY</CODE> drops the primary index. If no such
index exists, it drops the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index in the table.
(MySQL marks the first <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key as the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>
if no <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> was specified explicitly.)

<A NAME="IDX1477"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1478"></A>
If you add a <CODE>UNIQUE INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> to a table, this
is stored before any not <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index so that MySQL can detect
duplicate keys as early as possible.

<A NAME="IDX1479"></A>
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> allows you to create the new table with the rows in a
specific order.  Note that the table will not remain in this order after
inserts and deletes.  In some cases, it may make sorting easier for
MySQL if the table is in order by the column that you wish to
order it by later.  This option is mainly useful when you know that you
are mostly going to query the rows in a certain order; by using this
option after big changes to the table, you may be able to get higher
performance.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table, all non-unique
indexes are created in a separate batch (like in <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>).
This should make <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> much faster when you have many indexes.

<LI>

Since <STRONG>MySQL 4.0</STRONG> the above feature can be activated explicitly.
<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE KEYS</CODE> makes MySQL to stop updating
non-unique indexes for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table.
<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS</CODE> then should be used to recreate missing
indexes. As MySQL does it with special algorithm which is much
faster then inserting keys one by one, disabling keys could give a
considerable speedup on bulk inserts.

<A NAME="IDX1483"></A>
With the C API function <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>, you can find out how many

The <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE>, <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, and <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> clauses don't

Here is an example that shows some of the uses of <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.  We

</PRE>

<P>
To change column <CODE>a</CODE> from <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> to <CODE>TINYINT NOT NULL</CODE>
(leaving the name the same), and to change column <CODE>b</CODE> from
<CODE>CHAR(10)</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR(20)</CODE> as well as renaming it from <CODE>b</CODE> to
<CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 MODIFY a TINYINT NOT NULL, CHANGE b c CHAR(20);
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column named <CODE>d</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD d TIMESTAMP;
</PRE>

<P>
To add an index on column <CODE>d</CODE>, and make column <CODE>a</CODE> the primary key:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD INDEX (d), ADD PRIMARY KEY (a);
</PRE>

<P>
To remove column <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 DROP COLUMN c;
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> integer column named <CODE>c</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE t2 ADD c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
           ADD INDEX (c);
</PRE>

<P>
Note that we indexed <CODE>c</CODE>, because <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns must be
indexed, and also that we declare <CODE>c</CODE> as <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>, because
indexed columns cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
When you add an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, column values are filled in
with sequence numbers for you automatically.  You can set the first
sequence number by executing <CODE>SET INSERT_ID=#</CODE> before
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or using the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT = #</CODE> table option.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
With MyISAM tables, if you don't change the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the sequence number will not be affected. If you drop an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column and then add another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column, the numbers will start from 1 again.

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement to create indexes.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself
is created with <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> allows you to add indexes to existing tables.

<P>
A column list of the form <CODE>(col1,col2,...)</CODE> creates a multiple-column
index.  Index values are formed by concatenating the values of the given
columns.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns, indexes can be created that
use only part of a column, using <CODE>col_name(length)</CODE> syntax.  (On
<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns the length is required.) The
statement shown here creates an index using the first 10 characters of
the <CODE>name</CODE> column:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));
</PRE>

<P>
Because most names usually differ in the first 10 characters, this index should
not be much slower than an index created from the entire <CODE>name</CODE> column.
Also, using partial columns for indexes can make the index file much smaller,
which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
operations!

</P>
<P>
Note that you can only add an index on a column that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values or on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> column if you are using

The <CODE>USE db_name</CODE> statement tells MySQL to use the <CODE>db_name</CODE>
database as the default database for subsequent queries.  The database remains
current until the end of the session or until another <CODE>USE</CODE> statement
is issued:

mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;      # selects from db2.mytable
</PRE>

<P>
Making a particular database current by means of the <CODE>USE</CODE> statement
does not preclude you from accessing tables in other databases.  The following example
accesses the <CODE>author</CODE> table from the <CODE>db1</CODE> database and the
<CODE>editor</CODE> table from the <CODE>db2</CODE> database:

By default, MySQL runs in <CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode. This means that
as soon as you execute an update, MySQL will store the update on
disk.

</P>
<P>
If you are using transactions safe tables (like <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>,
<CODE>BDB</CODE>, you can put MySQL into
non-<CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode with the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0
</PRE>

<P>
After this you must use <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> to store your changes to disk or
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> if you want to ignore the changes you have made since
the beginning of your transaction.

</P>
<P>
If you want to switch from <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT</CODE> mode for one series of
statements, you can use the <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> or
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> or <CODE>BEGIN WORK</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1;
UPDATE table2 SET summmary=@A WHERE type=1;
COMMIT;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> was added to MySQL 4.0.11;  This is the recommended
way to start an ad-hoc transaction as this is ANSI SQL syntax,

</P>
<P>
Note that if you are using non-transaction-safe tables, the changes will be
stored at once, independent of the status of the <CODE>autocommit</CODE> mode.

</P>
<P>
If you do a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> when you have updated a non-transactional
table you will get an error (<CODE>ER_WARNING_NOT_COMPLETE_ROLLBACK</CODE>) as
a warning.  All transaction-safe tables will be restored but any
non-transaction-safe table will not change.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> or <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE>, you
should use the MySQL binary log for backups instead of the
older update log.  Transactions are stored in the binary log
in one chunk, upon <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>, to ensure that transactions which are
rolled back are not stored.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.

</P>

LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ [LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE}
            [, tbl_name [AS alias] {READ [LOCAL] | [LOW_PRIORITY] WRITE} ...]
...
UNLOCK TABLES
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> locks tables for the current thread.  <CODE>UNLOCK
TABLES</CODE> releases any locks held by the current thread.  All tables that
are locked by the current thread are automatically unlocked when the
thread issues another <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, or when the connection to the
server is closed.

</P>
<P>
To use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in MySQL 4.0.2 you need the global
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> privilege and a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> privilege on the
involved tables. In MySQL 3.23 you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>,
<CODE>insert</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> privileges for the
tables.

</P>
<P>
The main reasons to use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> are for emulating transactions
or getting more speed when updating tables.  This is explained in more
detail later.

</P>
<P>
If a thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock on a table, that thread (and all other
threads) can only read from the table. If a thread obtains a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>
lock on a table, then only the thread holding the lock can read from
or write to the table.  Other threads are blocked.

</P>
<P>
The difference between <CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> and <CODE>READ</CODE> is that
<CODE>READ LOCAL</CODE> allows non-conflicting <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements to
execute while the lock is held.  This can't however be used if you are
going to manipulate the database files outside MySQL while you
hold the lock.

</P>
<P>
When you use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, you must lock all tables that you are
going to use and you must use the same alias that you are going to use
in your queries!  If you are using a table multiple times in a query
(with aliases), you must get a lock for each alias!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> locks normally have higher priority than <CODE>READ</CODE> locks, to
ensure that updates are processed as soon as possible. This means that if one
thread obtains a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock and then another thread requests a
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock, subsequent <CODE>READ</CODE> lock requests will wait until the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> thread has gotten the lock and released it.  You can use
<CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks to allow other threads to obtain <CODE>READ</CODE>
locks while the thread is waiting for the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock. You should only
use <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> locks if you are sure that there will
eventually be a time when no threads will have a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works as follows:

<OL>
<LI>

Sort all tables to be locked in a internally defined order (from the
user standpoint the order is undefined).
<LI>

If a table is locked with a read and a write lock, put the write lock
before the read lock.
<LI>

Lock one table at a time until the thread gets all locks.
</OL>

<P>
This policy ensures that table locking is deadlock free. There is
however other things one needs to be aware of with this schema:

</P>
<P>
If you are using a <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY WRITE</CODE> lock for a table, this
means only that MySQL will wait for this particlar lock until
there is no threads that wants a <CODE>READ</CODE> lock.  When the thread has
got the <CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock and is waiting to get the lock for the next
table in the lock table list, all other threads will wait for the
<CODE>WRITE</CODE> lock to be released.  If this becomes a serious problem
with your application, you should consider converting some of your
tables to transactions safe tables.

</P>
<P>
You can safely kill a thread that is waiting for a table lock with
<CODE>KILL</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#KILL">4.5.5  <CODE>KILL</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that you should <STRONG>not</STRONG> lock any tables that you are using with
<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>.  This is because that in this case the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
is done by a separate thread.

</P>
<P>
Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements
are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any other currently executing
SQL statement. There are a few cases when you would like to lock tables
anyway:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you are going to run many operations on a bunch of tables, it's much
faster to lock the tables you are going to use.  The downside is, of course,
that no other thread can update a <CODE>READ</CODE>-locked table and no other
thread can read a <CODE>WRITE</CODE>-locked table.

The reason some things are faster under <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> is that
MySQL will not flush the key cache for the locked tables until
<CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> is called (normally the key cache is flushed after
each SQL statement). This speeds up inserting/updateing/deletes on
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

If you are using a storage engine in MySQL that doesn't support
transactions, you must use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> if you want to ensure that
no other thread comes between a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>. The
example shown here requires <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in order to execute safely:


<PRE>
mysql&#62; LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
mysql&#62; SELECT SUM(value) FROM trans WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql&#62; UPDATE customer SET total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
    -&#62;        WHERE customer_id=some_id;
mysql&#62; UNLOCK TABLES;
</PRE>

Without <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, there is a chance that another thread might
insert a new row in the <CODE>trans</CODE> table between execution of the
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.
</UL>

<P>
By using incremental updates (<CODE>UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value</CODE>) or the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function, you can
avoid using <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> in many cases.

</P>
<P>
You can also solve some cases by using the user-level lock functions
<CODE>GET_LOCK()</CODE> and <CODE>RELEASE_LOCK()</CODE>.  These locks are saved in a hash
table in the server and implemented with <CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and
<CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> for high speed.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Internal_locking">5.3.1  How MySQL Locks Tables</A>, for more information on locking policy.

</P>
<P>
You can lock all tables in all databases with read locks with the
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#FLUSH">4.5.3  <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> Syntax</A>. This is very
convenient way to get backups if you have a filesystem, like Veritas,
that can take snapshots in time.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> is not transaction-safe and will
automatically commit any active transactions before attempting to lock the
tables.

As of Version 3.23.23, MySQL has support for full-text indexing
and searching.  Full-text indexes in MySQL are an index of type
<CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>.  <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes are used with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables
and can be created from <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>,
or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns at <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> time or added later with
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>.  For large datasets, it will be
much faster to load your data into a table that has no <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>
index, then create the index with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> (or <CODE>CREATE
INDEX</CODE>).  Loading data into a table that already has a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>
index will be slower.

Full-text searching is performed with the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function.

<P>
The <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function performs a natural language search for a string
against a text collection (a set of one or more columns included in
a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index).  The search string is given as the argument to
<CODE>AGAINST()</CODE>.  The search is performed in case-insensitive fashion.
For every row in the table, <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> returns a relevance value,
that is, a similarity measure between the search string and the text in
that row in the columns named in the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> list.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> is used in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause (see example above)
the rows returned are automatically sorted with highest relevance first.
Relevance values are non-negative floating-point numbers.  Zero relevance
means no similarity.  Relevance is computed based on the number of words
in the row, the number of unique words in that row, the total number of
words in the collection, and the number of documents (rows) that contain
a particular word.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to perform a boolean mode search.  This is explained
later in the section.

</P>
<P>
The preceding example is a basic illustration showing how to use the
<CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function. Rows are returned in order of decreasing
relevance.

</P>
<P>
The next example shows how to retrieve the relevance values explicitly.
As neither <CODE>WHERE</CODE> nor <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> clauses are present, returned
rows are not ordered.

<P>
The following example is more complex.  The query returns the relevance
and still sorts the rows in order of decreasing relevance. To achieve
this result, you should specify <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> twice. This will cause no
additional overhead, because the MySQL optimiser will notice that the
two <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> calls are identical and invoke the full-text search
code only once.

<P>
MySQL uses a very simple parser to split text into words.  A ``word''
is any sequence of characters consisting of letters, digits, <SAMP>`''</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.  Any ``word'' that is present in the stopword list or is just
too short (3 characters or less) is ignored.

</P>
<P>
Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted
according to its significance in the query or collection.  This way, a
word that is present in many documents will have lower weight (and may
even have a zero weight), because it has lower semantic value in this
particular collection.  Otherwise, if the word is rare, it will receive a
higher weight.  The weights of the words are then combined to compute the
relevance of the row.

</P>
<P>
Such a technique works best with large collections (in fact, it was
carefully tuned this way).  For very small tables, word distribution
does not reflect adequately their semantic value, and this model
may sometimes produce bizarre results.

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
Empty set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
The search for the word <CODE>MySQL</CODE> produces no results in the above
example, because that word is present in more than half the rows.  As such,
it is effectively treated as a stopword (that is, a word with zero semantic
value).  This is the most desirable behaviour -- a natural language query
should not return every second row from a 1GB table.

</P>
<P>
A word that matches half of rows in a table is less likely to locate relevant
documents.  In fact, it will most likely find plenty of irrelevant documents.
We all know this happens far too often when we are trying to find something on
the Internet with a search engine.  It is with this reasoning that such rows
have been assigned a low semantic value in <STRONG>this particular dataset</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
As of Version 4.0.1, MySQL can also perform boolean full-text searches using
the <CODE>IN BOOLEAN MODE</CODE> modifier.

</P>

<P>
This query retrieved all the rows that contain the word <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
(note: the 50% threshold is not used), but that do <STRONG>not</STRONG> contain
the word <CODE>YourSQL</CODE>.  Note that a boolean mode search does not
automatically sort rows in order of decreasing relevance.  You can
see this from result of the preceding query, where the row with the
highest relevance (the one that contains <CODE>MySQL</CODE> twice) is listed
last, not first.  A boolean full-text search can also work even without
a <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index, although it would be <STRONG>slow</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>+</CODE>
<DD>
A leading plus sign indicates that this word <STRONG>must be</STRONG>
present in every row returned.
<DT><CODE>-</CODE>
<DD>
A leading minus sign indicates that this word <STRONG>must not be</STRONG>
present in any row returned.
<DT><CODE></CODE>
<DD>
By default (when neither plus nor minus is specified) the word is optional,
but the rows that contain it will be rated higher. This mimicks the
behaviour of <CODE>MATCH() ... AGAINST()</CODE> without the <CODE>IN BOOLEAN
MODE</CODE> modifier.
<DT><CODE>&#60; &#62;</CODE>
<DD>
These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the
relevance value that is assigned to a row.  The <CODE>&#60;</CODE> operator
decreases the contribution and the <CODE>&#62;</CODE> operator increases it.
See the example below.
<DT><CODE>( )</CODE>
<DD>
Parentheses are used to group words into subexpressions.
<DT><CODE>~</CODE>
<DD>
A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's
contribution to the row relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking
noise words. A row that contains such a word will be rated lower than
others, but will not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the
<CODE>-</CODE> operator.

An asterisk is the truncation operator. Unlike the other operators, it

<P>
Unfortunately, full-text search has few user-tunable parameters yet,
although adding some is very high on the TODO. If you have a
MySQL source distribution (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>), you can
exert more control over full-text searching behaviour.

</P>
<P>
Note that full-text search was carefully tuned for the best searching
effectiveness.  Modifying the default behaviour will, in most cases,
only make the search results worse.  Do not alter the MySQL sources
unless you know what you are doing!

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The minimum length of words to be indexed is defined by the MySQL
variable <CODE>ft_min_word_len</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
Change it to the value you prefer, and rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes.
(This variable is only available from MySQL version 4.0.)

<LI>

The stopword list can be loaded from file specified by
<CODE>ft_stopword_file</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
Rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes after modifying the stopword list.
(This variable is only available from MySQL version 4.0.10 and onwards)

<LI>

The 50% threshold is determined by the particular weighting scheme chosen.
To disable it, change the following line in <TT>`myisam/ftdefs.h'</TT>:

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
</PRE>

To:

<PRE>
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
</PRE>

Then recompile MySQL.
There is no need to rebuild the indexes in this case.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: by doing this you <STRONG>severely</STRONG> decrease MySQL's ability
to provide adequate relevance values for the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function.
If you really need to search for such common words, it would be better to
search using <CODE>IN BOOLEAN MODE</CODE> instead, which does not observe the 50%
threshold.

<LI>

Sometimes the search engine maintainer would like to change the operators used
for boolean full-text searches. These are defined by the

<P>
For those changes that require you to rebuild your <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes,

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1515"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1516"></A>

</P>
<P>
From version 4.0.1, <CODE>MySQL server</CODE> features a <CODE>Query Cache</CODE>.
When in use, the query cache stores the text of a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query
together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client.
If an identical query is later received, the server will retrieve
the results from the query cache rather than parsing and executing the
same query again.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The query cache does not return stale data. When data
is modified, any relevant entries in the query cache are flushed.

</P>
<P>
The query cache is extremely useful in an environment where (some)
tables don't change very often and you have a lot of identical queries.
This is a typical situation for many web servers that use a lot of
dynamic content.

</P>
<P>
Below is some performance data for the query cache. (These results were 
generated by running the MySQL benchmark suite on a Linux Alpha
2 x 500 MHz with 2GB RAM and a 64MB query cache):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If all of the queries you're performing are simple (such as selecting a
row from a table with one row); but still differ so that the queries can
not be cached, the overhead for having the query cache active is 13%.
This could be regarded as the worst case scenario. However, in real life,
queries are much more complicated than our simple example so the overhead
is normally significantly lower.
<LI>

Searches after one row in a one row table is 238% faster.
This can be regarded as close to the minimum speedup to be expected for
a query that is cached.
<LI>

If you want to disable the query cache code set <CODE>query_cache_size=0</CODE>.
By disabling the query cache code there is no noticeable overhead.
(query cache can be excluded from code with help of configure option
<CODE>--without-query-cache</CODE>)
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Query_Cache_How" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_Cache_How">6.9.1  How The Query Cache Operates</A></H3>

<P>
Queries are compared before parsing, thus

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
and

</P>

<PRE>
Select * from tbl_name
</PRE>

<P>
are regarded as different queries for query cache, so queries need
to be exactly the same (byte for byte) to be seen as identical.
In addition, a query may be seen as different if for instance one
client is using a new communication protocol format or another
character set than another client.

</P>
<P>
Queries that uses different databases, uses different protocol versions
or the uses different default character sets are considered different
queries and cached separately.

</P>
<P>
The cache does work for <CODE>SELECT CALC_ROWS ...</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT FOUND_ROWS() ...</CODE> type queries because the number of
found rows is also stored in the cache.

</P>
<P>
If query result was returned from query cache then status variable
<CODE>Com_select</CODE> will not be increased, but <CODE>Qcache_hits</CODE> will be. 
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache_Status_and_Maintenance">6.9.4  Query Cache Status and Maintenance</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a table changes (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER</CODE> or <CODE>DROP TABLE|DATABASE</CODE>),
then all cached queries that used this table (possibly through a
<CODE>MRG_MyISAM</CODE> table!) become invalid and are removed from the cache.

</P>
<P>
Transactional <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables that have been changed will be invalidated
when a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> is performed.

</P>
<P>
A query cannot be cached if it contains one of the functions:

<CODE>SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE ...</CODE>,
<CODE>SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE ...</CODE> or
of the form <CODE>SELECT * FROM AUTOINCREMENT_FIELD IS NULL</CODE>

</P>
<P>
However, <CODE>FOUND ROWS()</CODE> will return the correct value,
even if the preceding query was fetched from the cache.

</P>
<P>
In case a query does not use any tables, or uses temporary tables,
or if the user has a column privilege for any of the involved tables,
that query will not be cached.

</P>
<P>
Before a query is fetched from the query cache, MySQL will check that

<P>
Total number of queries =
<CODE>Qcache_inserts</CODE> + <CODE>Qcache_hits</CODE> + <CODE>Qcache_not_cached</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The query cache uses variable length blocks, so <CODE>Qcache_total_blocks</CODE>
and <CODE>Qcache_free_blocks</CODE> may indicate query cache memory fragmentation.
After <CODE>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</CODE> only a single (big) free block remains.

</P>
<P>
Note: Every query needs a minimum of two blocks (one for the query text
and one or more for the query results). Also, every table that is used
by a query needs one block, but if two or more queries use same table
only one block needs to be allocated.

</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>Qcache_lowmem_prunes</CODE> status variable to tune the query
cache size. It counts the number of queries that have been removed from the
cache to free up memory for caching new queries. The query cache uses a
<CODE>least recently used</CODE> (<CODE>LRU</CODE>) strategy to decide which queries to
remove from the cache.

<P>
As of MySQL Version 3.23.6, you can choose between three basic
table formats (<CODE>ISAM</CODE>, <CODE>HEAP</CODE> and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  Newer
versions of MySQL may support additional table types (<CODE>InnoDB</CODE>,
or <CODE>BDB</CODE>), depending on how you compile it.

</P>
<P>
When you create a new table, you can tell MySQL what type of table to create.
The default table type is usually <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL will always create a <TT>`.frm'</TT> file to hold the table and column
definitions. The table's index and data will be stored in one or more other
files, depending on the table type.

</P>
<P>
If you try to use a table type that is not compiled-in or activated,
MySQL will instead create a table of type <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.  This behaviour
is convenient when you want to copy tables between MySQL servers that
support different table types. (Perhaps your master server supports
transactional storage engines for increased safety, while the slave servers use
only non-transactional storage engines for greater speed.)

</P>
<P>
This automatic change of table types can be confusing for new MySQL users.  We
plan to fix this by introducing warnings in the new client-server protocol in
version 4.1 and generating a warning when a table type is automatically changed.

</P>
<P>
You can convert tables between different types with the <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ALTER_TABLE">6.5.4  <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL supports two different kinds of
tables: transaction-safe tables (<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> and <CODE>BDB</CODE>)
and not transaction-safe tables (<CODE>HEAP</CODE>, <CODE>ISAM</CODE>,
<CODE>MERGE</CODE>, and <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Advantages of transaction-safe tables (TST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Safer. Even if MySQL crashes or you get hardware problems, you
can get your data back, either by automatic recovery or from a backup
+ the transaction log.
<LI>

You can combine many statements and accept these all in one go with
the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> command.
<LI>

You can execute <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> to ignore your changes (if you are not
running in auto-commit mode).
<LI>

If an update fails, all your changes will be restored. (With NTST tables all
changes that have taken place are permanent)
<LI>

Can provide better concurrency if the table gets many updates concurrently
with reads.
</UL>

<P>
Note that to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables you have to use at least the
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> startup option. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.2  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
Advantages of not transaction-safe tables (NTST):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Much faster as there is no transaction overhead.
<LI>

Will use less disk space as there is no overhead of transactions.
<LI>

Will use less memory to do updates.
</UL>

<P>
You can combine TST and NTST tables in the same statements to get the best
of both worlds.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="MyISAM" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is the default table type in MySQL Version 3.23. It's
based on the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> code and has a lot of useful extensions.

</P>
<P>
The index is stored in a file with the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> (MYIndex) extension,
and the data is stored in a file with the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> (MYData) extension.
You can check/repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>
utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>. You can compress <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables with
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> to take up much less space.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following is new in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There is a flag in the <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> file that indicates whether
the table was closed correctly.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is started with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>, <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables will automatically be
checked and/or repaired on open if the table wasn't closed properly.
<LI>

You can <CODE>INSERT</CODE> new rows in a table that doesn't have free blocks
in the middle of the datafile, at the same time other threads are
reading from the table (concurrent insert).  An free block can come from
an update of a dynamic length row with much data to a row with less data
or when deleting rows. When all free blocks are used up, all future
inserts will be concurrent again.
<LI>

Support for big files (63-bit) on filesystems/operating systems that
support big files.
<LI>

All data is stored with the low byte first. This makes the data machine
and OS independent. The only requirement is that the machine uses
two's-complement signed integers (as every machine for the last 20 years
has) and IEEE floating-point format (also totally dominant among
mainstream machines). The only area of machines that may not support
binary compatibility are embedded systems (because they sometimes have
peculiar processors).

There is no big speed penalty in storing data low byte first; the bytes
in a table row is normally unaligned and it doesn't take that much more
power to read an unaligned byte in order than in reverse order.  The
actual fetch-column-value code is also not time critical compared to
other code.
<LI>

All number keys are stored with high byte first to give better index
compression.
<LI>

Internal handling of one <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column. <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
will automatically update this on <CODE>INSERT/UPDATE</CODE>. The
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value can be reset with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>. This
will make <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns faster (at least 10%) and old
numbers will not be reused as with the old <CODE>ISAM</CODE>. Note that when an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> is defined on the end of a multi-part-key the old
behaviour is still present.
<LI>

When inserted in sorted order (as when you are using an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>
column) the key tree will be split so that the high node only contains one
key. This will improve the space utilisation in the key tree.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns can be indexed.
<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> values are allowed in indexed columns.  This takes 0-1
bytes/key.
<LI>

Maximum key length is 500 bytes by default (can be changed by
recompiling).  In cases of keys longer than 250 bytes, a bigger key
block size than the default of 1024 bytes is used for this key.
<LI>

Maximum number of keys/table is 32 as default. This can be enlarged to 64
without having to recompile <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk</CODE> will mark tables as checked if one runs it with
<CODE>--update-state</CODE>. <CODE>myisamchk --fast</CODE> will only check those
tables that don't have this mark.
<LI>

<CODE>myisamchk -a</CODE> stores statistics for key parts (and not only for
whole keys as in <CODE>ISAM</CODE>).
<LI>

Dynamic size rows will now be much less fragmented when mixing deletes
with updates and inserts.  This is done by automatically combining adjacent
deleted blocks and by extending blocks if the next block is deleted.
<LI>

<CODE>myisampack</CODE> can pack <CODE>BLOB</CODE> and <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns.
<LI>

You can use put the datafile and index file on different directories
to get more speed (with the <CODE>DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY="path"</CODE> option to

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> also supports the following things, which MySQL
will be able to use in the near future:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Support for a true <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> type; a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column starts
with a length stored in 2 bytes.
<LI>

Tables with <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> may have fixed or dynamic record length.
<LI>

<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> and <CODE>CHAR</CODE> may be up to 64K.
All key segments have their own language definition. This will enable
MySQL to have different language definitions per column.
<LI>

A hashed computed index can be used for <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>. This will allow
you to have <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> on any combination of columns in a table. (You
can't search on a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> computed index, however.)
</UL>

<P>
Note that index files are usually much smaller with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> than with
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>. This means that <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> will normally use less
system resources than <CODE>ISAM</CODE>, but will need more CPU time when inserting
data into a compressed index.

</P>
<P>
The following options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be used to change the behaviour of

On open, the table is checked if it's marked as crashed or if the open
count variable for the table is not 0 and you are running with
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>.  If either of the above is true the following
happens.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The table is checked for errors.
<LI>

If we found an error, try to do a fast repair (with sorting and without
re-creating the datafile) of the table.
<LI>

If the repair fails because of an error in the datafile (for example a
duplicate key error), we try again, but this time we re-create the datafile.
<LI>

If the repair fails, retry once more with the old repair option method
(write row by row without sorting) which should be able to repair any
type of error with little disk requirements..
</UL>

<P>
If the recover wouldn't be able to recover all rows from a previous

<H3><A NAME="Key_space" HREF="manual_toc.html#Key_space">7.1.1  Space Needed for Keys</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1529"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL can support different index types, but the normal type is
ISAM or MyISAM.  These use a B-tree index, and you can roughly calculate
the size for the index file as <CODE>(key_length+4)/0.67</CODE>, summed over
all keys.  (This is for the worst case when all keys are inserted in
sorted order and we don't have any compressed keys.)

</P>
<P>
String indexes are space compressed. If the first index part is a
string, it will also be prefix compressed.  Space compression makes the
index file smaller than the above figures if the string column has a lot
of trailing space or is a <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> column that is not always used
to the full length. Prefix compression is used on keys that start
with a string.  Prefix compression helps if there are many strings
with an identical prefix.

</P>
<P>
In <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables, you can also prefix compress numbers by specifying
<CODE>PACK_KEYS=1</CODE> when you create the table.  This helps when you have
many integer keys that have an identical prefix when the numbers are stored
high-byte first.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="MyISAM_table_formats" HREF="manual_toc.html#MyISAM_table_formats">7.1.2  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Table Formats</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> supports 3 different table types. Two of them are chosen
automatically depending on the type of columns you are using. The third,
compressed tables, can only be created with the <CODE>myisampack</CODE> tool.

</P>
<P>
When you <CODE>CREATE</CODE> or <CODE>ALTER</CODE> a table you can for tables that
doesn't have <CODE>BLOB</CODE>s force the table format to <CODE>DYNAMIC</CODE> or
<CODE>FIXED</CODE> with the <CODE>ROW_FORMAT=#</CODE> table option.  In the future
you will be able to compress/decompress tables by specifying
<CODE>ROW_FORMAT=compressed | default</CODE> to <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="Static_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Static_format">7.1.2.1  Static (Fixed-length) Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
This is the default format. It's used when the table contains no
<CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>, or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.

</P>
<P>
This format is the simplest and most secure format. It is also the
fastest of the on-disk formats. The speed comes from the easy way data
can be found on disk. When looking up something with an index and static
format it is very simple. Just multiply the row number by the row length.

</P>
<P>
Also, when scanning a table it is very easy to read a constant number of
records with each disk read.

</P>
<P>
The security is evidenced if your computer crashes when writing to a
fixed-size MyISAM file, in which case <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> can easily figure out where each
row starts and ends. So it can usually reclaim all records except the
partially written one. Note that in MySQL all indexes can always be
reconstructed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All <CODE>CHAR</CODE>, <CODE>NUMERIC</CODE>, and <CODE>DECIMAL</CODE> columns are space-padded
to the column width.
<LI>

Very quick.
<LI>

Easy to cache.
<LI>

Easy to reconstruct after a crash, because records are located in fixed
positions.
<LI>

Doesn't have to be reorganised (with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>) unless a huge number of
records are deleted and you want to return free disk space to the operating
system.
<LI>

Usually requires more disk space than dynamic tables.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="Dynamic_format" HREF="manual_toc.html#Dynamic_format">7.1.2.2  Dynamic Table Characteristics</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1530"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1531"></A>

</P>
<P>
This format is used if the table contains any <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>, <CODE>BLOB</CODE>,
or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns or if the table was created with
<CODE>ROW_FORMAT=dynamic</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This format is a little more complex because each row has to have a header
that says how long it is. One record can also end up at more than one
location when it is made longer at an update.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1532"></A>
You can use <CODE>OPTIMIZE table</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> to defragment a
table. If you have static data that you access/change a lot in the same
table as some <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns, it might be a good
idea to move the dynamic columns to other tables just to avoid
fragmentation:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All string columns are dynamic (except those with a length less than 4).
<LI>

Each record is preceded by a bitmap indicating which columns are empty
(<CODE>''</CODE>) for string columns, or zero for numeric columns. (This isn't
the same as columns containing <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.) If a string column
has a length of zero after removal of trailing spaces, or a numeric
column has a value of zero, it is marked in the bit map and not saved to
disk.  Non-empty strings are saved as a length byte plus the string
contents.
<LI>

Usually takes much less disk space than fixed-length tables.
<LI>

Each record uses only as much space as is required. If a record becomes
larger, it is split into as many pieces as are required.  This results in record
fragmentation.
<LI>

If you update a row with information that extends the row length, the
row will be fragmented.  In this case, you may have to run <CODE>myisamchk
-r</CODE> from time to time to get better performance.  Use <CODE>myisamchk -ei
tbl_name</CODE> for some statistics.
<LI>

Not as easy to reconstruct after a crash, because a record may be fragmented
into many pieces and a link (fragment) may be missing.
<LI>

The expected row length for dynamic sized records is:


<PRE>
3
+ (number of columns + 7) / 8
+ (number of char columns)
+ packed size of numeric columns
+ length of strings
+ (number of NULL columns + 7) / 8
</PRE>

There is a penalty of 6 bytes for each link. A dynamic record is linked
whenever an update causes an enlargement of the record. Each new link will be
at least 20 bytes, so the next enlargement will probably go in the same link.
If not, there will be another link. You may check how many links there are
with <CODE>myisamchk -ed</CODE>. All links may be removed with <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE>.
</UL>

This is a read-only type that is generated with the optional
<CODE>myisampack</CODE> tool (<CODE>pack_isam</CODE> for <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables):

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All MySQL distributions, even those that existed before MySQL
went GPL, can read tables that were compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.
<LI>

Compressed tables take very little disk space. This minimises disk usage, which
is very nice when using slow disks (like CD-ROMs).
<LI>

Each record is compressed separately (very little access overhead).  The
header for a record is fixed (1-3 bytes) depending on the biggest record in the
table.  Each column is compressed differently. Some of the compression types
are:

<UL>
<LI>

There is usually a different Huffman table for each column.
<LI>

Suffix space compression.
<LI>

Prefix space compression.
<LI>

Numbers with value <CODE>0</CODE> are stored using 1 bit.
<LI>

If values in an integer column have a small range, the column is stored using
the smallest possible type. For example, a <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> column (8 bytes) may
be stored as a <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> column (1 byte) if all values are in the range
<CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>255</CODE>.
<LI>

If a column has only a small set of possible values, the column type is
converted to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>.
<LI>

A column may use a combination of the above compressions.

<LI>

Can handle fixed- or dynamic-length records.

<H4><A NAME="Corrupted_MyISAM_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Corrupted_MyISAM_tables">7.1.3.1  Corrupted <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A></H4>

<P>
Even if the MyISAM table format is very reliable (all changes to a table
is written before the SQL statements returns) , you can still get
corrupted tables if some of the following things happens:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process being killed in the middle of a write.
<LI>

Unexpected shutdown of the computer (for example, if the computer is turned
off).
<LI>

A hardware error.
<LI>

You are using an external program (like myisamchk) on a live table.
<LI>

A software bug in the MySQL or MyISAM code.
</UL>

<P>
Typial typical symptoms for a corrupt table is:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You get the error <CODE>Incorrect key file for table: '...'. Try to repair it</CODE>
while selecting data from the table.
<LI>

Queries doesn't find rows in the table or returns incomplete data.
</UL>

<P>
You can check if a table is ok with the command <CODE>CHECK
TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CHECK_TABLE">4.4.4  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can repair a corrupted table with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#REPAIR_TABLE">4.4.5  <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
You can also repair a table, when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running with
the <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> command. <CODE>myisamchk syntax</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If your tables get corrupted a lot you should try to find the reason for
this! See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
In this case the most important thing to know is if the table got
corrupted if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died (one can easily verify this by
checking if there is a recent row <CODE>restarted mysqld</CODE> in the mysqld
error file).  If this isn't the case, then you should try to make a test
case of this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case When You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

<P>
Each <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file has in the header a counter that can

If you get the following warning from <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
# clients is using or hasn't closed the table properly
</PRE>

<P>
this means that this counter has come out of sync.  This doesn't mean
that the table is corrupted, but means that you should at least do a
check on the table to verify that it's okay.

</P>
<P>
The counter works as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first time a table is updated in MySQL, a counter in the
header of the index files is incremented.
<LI>

The counter is not changed during further updates.
<LI>

When the last instance of a table is closed (because of a <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> or
because there isn't room in the table cache) the counter is
decremented if the table has been updated at any point.
<LI>

When you repair the table or check the table and it was okay,
the counter is reset to 0.
<LI>

To avoid problems with interaction with other processes that may do a
check on the table, the counter is not decremented on close if it was 0.
</UL>

<P>
In other words, the only ways this can go out of sync are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are copied without a <CODE>LOCK</CODE> and
<CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL has crashed between an update and the final close.
(Note that the table may still be okay, as MySQL always issues writes
for everything between each statement.)
<LI>

Someone has done a <CODE>myisamchk --recover</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk
--update-state</CODE>on a table that was in use by <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers are using the table and one has done a
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or <CODE>CHECK</CODE> of the table while it was in use by
another server.  In this setup the <CODE>CHECK</CODE> is safe to do (even if
you will get the warning from other servers), but <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> should
be avoided as it currently replaces the datafile with a new one, which
is not signaled to the other servers.

<H2><A NAME="MERGE" HREF="manual_toc.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1537"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1538"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are new in MySQL Version 3.23.25. The code
is still in gamma, but should be resonable stable.

</P>
<P>
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table (also known as a <CODE>MRG_MyISAM</CODE> table) is a
collection of identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables that can be used as one.
You can only <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, and <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> from the
collection of tables.  If you <CODE>DROP</CODE> the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you
are only dropping the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> specification.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables. (We plan to fix this in 4.1).

</P>
<P>
With identical tables we mean that all tables are created with identical
column and key information.  You can't merge tables in which the
columns are packed differently, doesn't have exactly the same columns,
or have the keys in different order.  However, some of the tables can be
compressed with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#myisampack">4.7.4  <CODE>myisampack</CODE>, The MySQL Compressed Read-only Table Generator</A>.

</P>
<P>
When you create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, you will get a <TT>`.frm'</TT> table
definition file and a <TT>`.MRG'</TT> table list file.  The <TT>`.MRG'</TT> just
contains a list of the index files (<TT>`.MYI'</TT> files) that should
be used as one.  All used tables must be in the same database as the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table itself.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, you need to have <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and
<CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges on the tables you map to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables can help you solve the following problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Easily manage a set of log tables. For example, you can put data from
different months into separate files, compress some of them with
<CODE>myisampack</CODE>, and then create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> to use these as one.
<LI>

Give you more speed. You can split a big read-only table based on some
criteria and then put the different table part on different disks.
A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on this could be much faster than using
the big table. (You can, of course, also use a RAID to get the same
kind of benefits.)
<LI>

Do more efficient searches. If you know exactly what you are looking
after, you can search in just one of the split tables for some queries
and use a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table for others.  You can even have many
different <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables active, with possible overlapping files.
<LI>

More efficient repairs. It's easier to repair the individual files that
are mapped to a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> file than trying to repair a really big file.
<LI>

Instant mapping of many files as one. A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table uses the
index of the individual tables. It doesn't need to maintain an index of
its one.  This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table collections VERY fast to make or
remap.  Note that you must specify the key definitions when you create
a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table!.
<LI>

If you have a set of tables that you join to a big table on demand or
batch, you should instead create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table on them on demand.
This is much faster and will save a lot of disk space.
<LI>

Go around the file-size limit for the operating system.
<LI>

You can create an alias/synonym for a table by just using <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
over one table. There shouldn't be any really notable performance
impacts of doing this (only a couple of indirect calls and <CODE>memcpy()</CODE>
calls for each read).
</UL>

<P>
The disadvantages with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can only use identical <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables for a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> doesn't work.
<LI>

<CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables uses more file descriptors. If you are using a
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table that maps over 10 tables and 10 users are using this, you
are using 10*10 + 10 file descriptors.  (10 datafiles for 10 users
and 10 shared index files.)
<LI>

Key reads are slower. When you do a read on a key, the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
storage engine will need to issue a read on all underlying tables to check
which one most closely matches the given key.  If you then do a "read-next"
then the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> storage engine will need to search the read buffers
to find the next key. Only when one key buffer is used up, the storage engine
will need to read the next key block. This makes <CODE>MERGE</CODE> keys much slower
on <CODE>eq_ref</CODE> searches, but not much slower on <CODE>ref</CODE> searches.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.
<LI>

You can't do
<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE> without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause,
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE TABLE</CODE>,
<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>, or
<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE>
on any of the table that is
mapped by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table that is "open".  If you do this, the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table may still refer to the original table and you will
get unexpected results. The easiest way to get around this deficiency
is to issue the <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE> command, ensuring no <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables remain "open".
</UL>

<P>
When you create a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table you have to specify with
<CODE>UNION(list-of-tables)</CODE> which tables you want to use as
one. Optionally you can specify with <CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> if you want
insert for the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table to happen in the first or last table
in the <CODE>UNION</CODE> list. If you don't specify <CODE>INSERT_METHOD</CODE> or
specify <CODE>NO</CODE>, then all <CODE>INSERT</CODE> commands on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
table will return an error.

</P>
<P>
The following example shows you how to use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20));
INSERT INTO t1 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t1");
INSERT INTO t2 (message) VALUES ("Testing"),("table"),("t2");
CREATE TABLE total (a INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, message CHAR(20))
             TYPE=MERGE UNION=(t1,t2) INSERT_METHOD=LAST;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that you can also manipulate the <TT>`.MRG'</TT> file directly from
the outside of the MySQL server:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; cd /mysql-data-directory/current-database
shell&#62; ls -1 t1.MYI t2.MYI &#62; total.MRG
shell&#62; mysqladmin flush-tables
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can do things like:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM total;
+---+---------+
| a | message |
+---+---------+
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t1      |
| 1 | Testing |
| 2 | table   |
| 3 | t2      |
+---+---------+
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>a</CODE> column, though declared as <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>,
is not really unique, as <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table cannot enforce uniqueness
over a set of underlying <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.

</P>
<P>
To remap a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table you can do one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>DROP</CODE> the table and re-create it
<LI>

Use <CODE>ALTER TABLE table_name UNION(...)</CODE>
<LI>

Change the <TT>`.MRG'</TT> file and issue a <CODE>FLUSH TABLE</CODE> on the
<CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and all underlying tables to force the storage engine to

<H3><A NAME="MERGE_table_problems" HREF="manual_toc.html#MERGE_table_problems">7.2.1  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Table Problems</A></H3>

<P>
The following are the known problems with <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table cannot maintain <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> constraints over the
whole table.  When you do <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, the data goes into the first or
last table (according to <CODE>INSERT_METHOD=xxx</CODE>) and this <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table ensures that the data are unique, but it knows nothing about
others <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM merge_table</CODE> used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
will only clear the mapping for the table, not delete everything in the
mapped tables.
<LI>

<CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> on a table used in an active <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table may
corrupt the table.  This will be fixed in MySQL 4.0.x.
<LI>

Creation of a table of type <CODE>MERGE</CODE> doesn't check if the underlying
tables are of compatible types.  If you use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables in this
fashion, you are very likely to run into strange problems.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to first add an <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> index to a
table used in a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table and then use <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to
add a normal index on the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table, the key order will be
different for the tables if there was an old non-unique key in the
table. This is because <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> puts <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys before
normal keys to be able to detect duplicate keys as early as possible.
<LI>

The range optimiser can't yet use <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table efficiently and may
sometimes produce non-optimal joins.  This will be fixed in MySQL 4.0.x.
<LI>

<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> on a table that is in use by a <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table will
not work on Windows because the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> storage engine does the table mapping
hidden from the upper layer of MySQL.  Because Windows doesn't allow you
to drop files that are open, you first must flush all <CODE>MERGE</CODE>
tables (with <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>) or drop the <CODE>MERGE</CODE> table before
dropping the table.  We will fix this at the same time we introduce
<CODE>VIEW</CODE>s.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="ISAM" HREF="manual_toc.html#ISAM">7.3  <CODE>ISAM</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1539"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can also use the deprecated <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table type. This will disappear
rather soon (probably in MySQL 5.0) because <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is a better
implementation of the same thing. <CODE>ISAM</CODE> uses a <CODE>B-tree</CODE> index. The
index is stored in a file with the <TT>`.ISM'</TT> extension, and the data
is stored in a file with the <TT>`.ISD'</TT> extension.  You can
check/repair <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables with the <CODE>isamchk</CODE> utility. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crash_recovery">4.4.6.7  Using <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> for Crash Recovery</A>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ISAM</CODE> has the following features/properties:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Compressed and fixed-length keys

<LI>Fixed and dynamic record length

<LI>16 keys with 16 key parts/key

<LI>Max key length 256 (default)

<LI>Data is stored in machine format; this is fast, but is machine/OS dependent.

</UL>

<P>
Most of the things true for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are also true for <CODE>ISAM</CODE>
tables. See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>. The major differences compared
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables are not binary portable across OS/Platforms.

<LI>Can't handle tables &#62; 4G.

<LI>Only support prefix compression on strings.

<LI>Smaller key limits.

<LI>Dynamic tables get more fragmented.

<LI>Tables are compressed with <CODE>pack_isam</CODE> rather than with <CODE>myisampack</CODE>.

</UL>

<P>
If you want to convert an <CODE>ISAM</CODE> table to a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table so
that you can use utilities such as <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>, use an <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; ALTER TABLE tbl_name TYPE = MYISAM;
</PRE>

<P>
The embedded MySQL versions doesn't support <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="HEAP" HREF="manual_toc.html#HEAP">7.4  <CODE>HEAP</CODE> Tables</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1540"></A>

</P>
<P>
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use hashed indexes and are stored in memory.  This
makes them very fast, but if MySQL crashes you will lose all
data stored in them.  <CODE>HEAP</CODE> is very useful for temporary tables!

</P>
<P>
The MySQL internal <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use 100% dynamic hashing
without overflow areas. There is no extra space needed for free lists.
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables also don't have problems with delete + inserts, which
normally is common with hashed tables:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; CREATE TABLE test TYPE=HEAP SELECT ip,SUM(downloads) AS down
    -&#62;                   FROM log_table GROUP BY ip;
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(ip),AVG(down) FROM test;
mysql&#62; DROP TABLE test;
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some things you should consider when you use <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You should always use specify <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> in the <CODE>CREATE</CODE> statement
to ensure that you accidentally do not use all memory.
<LI>

Indexes will only be used with <CODE>=</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> (but are VERY fast).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables can only use whole keys to search for a row; compare this
to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables where any prefix of the key can be used to find rows.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables use a fixed record length format.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Prior to MySQL 4.0.2, <CODE>HEAP</CODE> doesn't support an index on a <CODE>NULL</CODE>
column.
<LI>

You can have non-unique keys in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table (this isn't common for
hashed tables).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are shared between all clients (just like any other
table).
<LI>

You can't search for the next entry in order (that is, to use the index
to do an <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>).
<LI>

Data for <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables are allocated in small blocks. The tables
are 100% dynamic (on inserting). No overflow areas and no extra key
space are needed.  Deleted rows are put in a linked list and are
reused when you insert new data into the table.
<LI>

You need enough extra memory for all <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables that you want to use at
the same time.
<LI>

To free memory, you should execute <CODE>DELETE FROM heap_table</CODE>,
<CODE>TRUNCATE heap_table</CODE> or <CODE>DROP TABLE heap_table</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL cannot find out approximately how many rows there
are between two values (this is used by the range optimiser to decide which
index to use).  This may affect some queries if you change a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
table to a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table.
<LI>

To ensure that you accidentally don't do anything foolish, you can't create
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables bigger than <CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
The memory needed for one row in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table is:

</P>

<PRE>
SUM_OVER_ALL_KEYS(max_length_of_key + sizeof(char*) * 2)
+ ALIGN(length_of_row+1, sizeof(char*))
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sizeof(char*)</CODE> is 4 on 32-bit machines and 8 on 64-bit machines.

<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>

</P>
<P>
InnoDB provides MySQL with a transaction-safe (<CODE>ACID</CODE> compliant)
storage engine with commit, rollback, and crash recovery capabilities.
InnoDB does locking on row level and also provides an Oracle-style
consistent
non-locking read in <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s. These features increase
multiuser concurrency and performance. There is no need for
lock escalation in InnoDB,
because row level locks in InnoDB fit in very small space.
InnoDB tables support <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraints
as the first table type in MySQL.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB has been designed for maximum performance
when processing
large data volumes. Its CPU efficiency is probably not
matched by any other disk-based relational database engine.

</P>
<P>
Technically, InnoDB is a complete database backend placed under MySQL.
InnoDB has its own buffer pool for caching data and indexes in main
memory. InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace, which
may consist of several files. This is different from, for example,
MyISAM tables where each table is stored as a separate file.
InnoDB tables can be of any size also on those operating
systems where file-size is limited to 2 GB.

</P>
<P>
You can find the latest information about InnoDB at
<a HREF="http://www.innodb.com/">http://www.innodb.com/</a>. The most up-to-date version of the
InnoDB manual is always placed there, and you can also order
commercial licenses and support for InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB is currently (October 2001) used in production at
several large database sites requiring high performance.
The famous Internet news site Slashdot.org runs on
InnoDB. Mytrix, Inc. stores over 1 TB of data in
InnoDB, and another site handles an average
load of 800 inserts/updates per second in InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB tables are included in the MySQL source distribution
starting from 3.23.34a and are activated in the MySQL -Max
binary. For Windows the -Max binaries are contained in the
standard distribution.

</P>
<P>
If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes
support for InnoDB, simply follow the instructions of the
MySQL manual
for installing a binary version of MySQL. If you already have
MySQL-3.23 installed, then the simplest way to install
MySQL -Max is to replace the server executable <TT>`mysqld'</TT>
with the corresponding executable in the -Max distribution.
MySQL and MySQL -Max differ only in the server executable.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.10  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
To compile MySQL with InnoDB support,
download MySQL-3.23.34a or newer version from
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
and configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-innodb</CODE> option. See the
MySQL manual
about installing a MySQL source distribution.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

</P>

<PRE>
cd /path/to/source/of/mysql-3.23.37
./configure --with-innodb
</PRE>

<P>
To use InnoDB you have to specify InnoDB startup options in
your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file. The minimal way
to modify it is to add to the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section the line

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=ibdata:30M
</PRE>

<P>
but to get good performance it is best that you specify options
as recommended. See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.2  InnoDB Startup Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB is distributed under the GNU GPL License Version 2 (of June 1991).
In the source distribution of MySQL, InnoDB appears as a subdirectory.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_start" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_start">7.5.2  InnoDB Startup Options</A></H3>

<P>
To use InnoDB tables in MySQL-Max-3.23 you MUST specify configuration
parameters
in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of
the configuration file <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>, or on Windows optionally in
<TT>`my.ini'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
At the minimum, in 3.23 you must specify <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>
where you specify the names and the sizes of datafiles. If you do
not mention <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> the default
is to create these files to the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.
If you specify <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> as an empty string,
then you can give absolute paths to your data files in
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
In MySQL-4.0 you do not need to specify even
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>: the default for it is to create
an auto-extending 10 MB file <TT>`ibdata1'</TT> to the <CODE>datadir</CODE>
of MySQL. (In MySQL-4.0.0 and 4.0.1 the datafile is 64 MB and not
auto-extending.)

</P>
<P>
If you don't want to use <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables, you can add the
<CODE>skip-innodb</CODE> option to your MySQL option file.

</P>
<P>
But to get good performance you MUST explicitly set the InnoDB parameters
listed in the following examples.

</P>
<P>
Starting from versions 3.23.50 and 4.0.2 InnoDB allows the last
datafile on the <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> line
to be specified as <STRONG>auto-extending</STRONG>. The syntax for
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> is then the following:

<PRE>
pathtodatafile:sizespecification;pathtodatafile:sizespecification;...
...  ;pathtodatafile:sizespecification[:autoextend[:max:sizespecification]]
</PRE>

<P>
If you specify the last datafile with the autoextend option, InnoDB
will extend the last datafile if it runs out of free space in the
tablespace. The increment is 8 MB at a time. An example:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:100M:autoextend
</PRE>

<P>
instructs InnoDB to create just a single datafile whose initial size is
100 MB and which is extended in 8 MB blocks when space runs out.
If the disk becomes full you may want to add another data
file to another disk, for example. Then you have to look the size
of <TT>`ibdata1'</TT>, round the size downward to
the closest multiple of 1024 * 1024 bytes (= 1 MB), and specify
the rounded size of <TT>`ibdata1'</TT> explicitly in
<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
After that you can add another datafile:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:988M;/disk2/ibdata2:50M:autoextend
</PRE>

<P>
Be cautious on filesystems where the maximum file-size is 2 GB!
InnoDB is not aware of the OS maximum file-size. On those filesystems
you might want to specify the max size for the datafile:

<PRE>
innodb_data_home_dir =
innodb_data_file_path = /ibdata/ibdata1:100M:autoextend:max:2000M
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>A simple <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> example.</STRONG> Suppose you have a computer
with 128 MB RAM and one hard disk. Below is an example of
possible configuration parameters in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or
<TT>`my.ini'</TT> for InnoDB. We assume you are running
MySQL-Max-3.23.50 or later, or MySQL-4.0.2 or later.
This example suits most users, both on Unix and Windows,
who do not want to distribute InnoDB datafiles and
log files on several disks. This creates an
auto-extending data file <TT>`ibdata1'</TT> and two InnoDB log files
<TT>`ib_logfile0'</TT> and <TT>`ib_logfile1'</TT> to the
<CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL (typically <TT>`/mysql/data'</TT>).
Also the small archived InnoDB log file
<TT>`ib_arch_log_0000000000'</TT> ends up in the <CODE>datadir</CODE>.

<P>
When you for the first time create an InnoDB database, it is
best that you start the MySQL server from the command prompt.
Then InnoDB will print the information about the database
creation to the screen, and you see what is happening.
See below next section what the printout should look like.
For example, in Windows you can start <TT>`mysqld-max.exe'</TT> with: 

</P>

<P>
<STRONG>Where to put <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> in Windows?</STRONG>
The rules for Windows are the following:

<UL>
<LI>Only one of <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT> should be created.

<LI>The <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file should be placed in the root

directory of the drive <TT>`C:'</TT>.
<LI>The <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file should be placed in the WINDIR directory, e.g,

<TT>`C:\WINDOWS'</TT> or <TT>`C:\WINNT'</TT>. You can use the <CODE>SET</CODE>
command of MS-DOS to print the value of WINDIR.
<LI>If your PC uses a boot loader where the <TT>`C:'</TT> drive

is not the boot drive, then your only option is to use the <TT>`my.ini'</TT> file.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Where to specify options in Unix?</STRONG>
On Unix <TT>`mysqld'</TT> reads options from the following files, if they exist,
in the following order: 

<UL>
<LI><TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>  Global options.

<LI><TT>`COMPILATION_DATADIR/my.cnf'</TT>  Server-specific options.

was compiled
(typically <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/data'</TT> for a binary installation or <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT> for a source installation).

</P>
<P>
If you are not sure from where <TT>`mysqld'</TT> reads its <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>

InnoDB forms the directory path to a datafile by textually catenating

<CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, adding a possible slash or
backslash in between if needed. If the keyword
<CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> is not mentioned in
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> at all, the default for it is the
'dot' directory <TT>`./'</TT> which means the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.

<P>
Note that we have placed the two datafiles on different disks.
InnoDB will fill the tablespace
formed by the datafiles from bottom up. In some cases it will
improve the performance of the database if all data is not placed
on the same physical disk. Putting log files on a different disk from
data is very often beneficial for performance.
You can also use <STRONG>raw disk partitions</STRONG> (raw devices)
as datafiles. In some Unixes
they speed up I/O. See the manual section on InnoDB file space management 
about how to specify them in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: on Linux x86 you must be careful you <STRONG>do not set memory usage
too high</STRONG>. glibc will allow the process heap to grow over thread stacks,
which will crash your server. It is a risk if the value of

<PRE>
innodb_buffer_pool_size + key_buffer +
max_connections * (sort_buffer + read_buffer_size) + max_connections * 2 MB
</PRE>

<P>

The meanings of the configuration parameters are the following:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Option</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The common part of the directory path for all InnoDB datafiles.
If you do not mentioned this option in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
the default is the <CODE>datadir</CODE> of MySQL.
You can specify this also as an empty string, in which case you
can use absolute file paths in <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE> </TD><TD>
Paths to individual datafiles and their sizes. The full directory path
to each datafile is acquired by concatenating innodb_data_home_dir to
the paths specified here. The file-sizes are specified in megabytes,
hence the 'M' after the size specification above.
InnoDB also understands the abbreviation 'G', 1G meaning 1024M.
Starting from
3.23.44 you can set the file-size bigger than 4 GB on those
operating systems which support big files.
On some operating systems files must be &#60; 2 GB.
The sum of the sizes of the files must be at least 10 MB.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_mirrored_log_groups</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of identical copies of log groups we
keep for the database. Currently this should be set to 1.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
Directory path to InnoDB log files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_files_in_group</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of log files in the log group. InnoDB writes to the files in a
circular fashion. Value 3 is recommended here.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_file_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of each log file in a log group in megabytes. Sensible values range
from 1M to 1/nth of the size of the buffer pool specified below,
where n is the number of log files in the group. The
bigger the value,
the less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer pool,
saving disk I/O. But bigger log files also mean that recovery will be
slower in case of a crash. The combined size of log files must
be &#60; 4 GB on 32-bit computers.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_buffer_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the buffer which InnoDB uses to write log to the log files
on disk.  Sensible values range from 1M to 8M.
A big log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need
to write the log to disk until the transaction commit. Thus, if you have
big transactions, making the log buffer big will save disk I/O.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</CODE> </TD><TD>
Normally this is set to 1, meaning that at a transaction commit the log
is flushed to disk, and the modifications made by the transaction become
permanent, and survive a database crash. If you are willing to
compromise this safety, and you are running small transactions, you may
set this to 0 to reduce disk I/O to the logs.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_arch_dir</CODE> </TD><TD>
The directory where fully written log files would be archived if we used
log archiving.  The value of this parameter should currently be set the
same as <CODE>innodb_log_group_home_dir</CODE>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_log_archive</CODE> </TD><TD>
This value should currently be set to 0.  As recovery from a backup is
done by MySQL using its own log files, there is currently no need to
archive InnoDB log files.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_buffer_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
The size of the memory buffer InnoDB uses to cache data and indexes of
its tables.  The bigger you set this the less disk I/O is needed to
access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may cause
paging in the operating system.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_additional_mem_pool_size</CODE> </TD><TD>
Size of a memory pool InnoDB uses to store data dictionary information
and other internal data structures. A sensible value for this might be
2M, but the more tables you have in your application the more you will
need to allocate here. If InnoDB runs out of memory in this pool, it
will start to allocate memory from the operating system, and write
warning messages to the MySQL error log.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_file_io_threads</CODE> </TD><TD>
Number of file I/O threads in InnoDB. Normally, this should be 4, but
on Windows disk I/O may benefit from a larger number.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> </TD><TD>
Timeout in seconds an InnoDB transaction may wait for a lock before
being rolled back.  InnoDB automatically detects transaction deadlocks
in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you use
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> command, or other transaction-safe storage engines
than InnoDB in the same transaction, then a deadlock may arise which
InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like this the timeout is useful to
resolve the situation.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> </TD><TD>
(Available from 3.23.40 up.)
The default value for this is <CODE>fdatasync</CODE>.
Another option is <CODE>O_DSYNC</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_init" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_init">7.5.3  Creating InnoDB Tablespace</A></H3>

<P>
Suppose you have installed MySQL and have edited <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> so that
it contains the necessary InnoDB configuration parameters.
Before starting MySQL you should check that the directories you have
specified for InnoDB datafiles and log files exist and that you have
access rights to those directories. InnoDB
cannot create directories, only files. Check also you have enough disk space
for the data and log files.

</P>
<P>
When you now start MySQL, InnoDB will start creating your datafiles
and log files. InnoDB will print something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: The first specified datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata1
did not exist:
InnoDB: a new database to be created!
InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata1 size to 134217728
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: datafile /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 did not exist:

InnoDB: Setting file /home/heikki/data/ibdata2 size to 262144000
InnoDB: Database physically writes the file full: wait...
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 did not exist:

InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile0 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 did not exist:

InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile1 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 did not exist:

InnoDB: Setting log file /home/heikki/data/logs/ib_logfile2 size to 5242880
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
</PRE>

<P>
A new InnoDB database has now been created. You can connect to the MySQL
server with the usual MySQL client programs like <CODE>mysql</CODE>.
When you shut down the MySQL server with <TT>`mysqladmin shutdown'</TT>,
InnoDB output will be like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Normal shutdown
010321 18:33:34  mysqld: Shutdown Complete
InnoDB: Starting shutdown...
InnoDB: Shutdown completed
</PRE>

<P>
You can now look at the datafiles and logs directories and you
will see the files created. The log directory will also contain
a small file named <TT>`ib_arch_log_0000000000'</TT>. That file
resulted from the database creation, after which InnoDB switched off
log archiving.
When MySQL is again started, the output will be like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: Started
mysqld: ready for connections
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="Error_creating_InnoDB" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_creating_InnoDB">7.5.3.1  If Something Goes Wrong in Database Creation</A></H4>

<P>
If InnoDB prints an operating system error in a file operation,
usually the problem is one of the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>You did not create InnoDB data or log directories.

<LI><TT>`mysqld'</TT> does not have the rights to create files in those

directories.
<LI><TT>`mysqld'</TT> does not read the right <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> or <TT>`my.ini'</TT>

file, and consequently does not see the options you specified.
<LI>The disk is full or a disk quota is exceeded.

<LI>You have created a subdirectory whose name is equal to a datafile

you specified.
<LI>There is a syntax error in <CODE>innodb_data_home_dir</CODE>

or <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
If something goes wrong in an InnoDB database creation, you should
delete all files created by InnoDB. This means all datafiles, all log
files, the small archived log file, and in the case you already did
create some InnoDB tables, delete also the corresponding <TT>`.frm'</TT>
files for these tables from the MySQL database
directories. Then you can try the InnoDB database creation again.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Using_InnoDB_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_InnoDB_tables">7.5.4  Creating InnoDB Tables</A></H3>

<P>
Suppose you have started the MySQL client with the command
<CODE>mysql test</CODE>.
To create a table in the InnoDB format you must specify
<CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE> in the table creation SQL command:

</P>

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (A INT, B CHAR (20), INDEX (A)) TYPE = InnoDB;
</PRE>

<P>
This SQL command will create a table and an index on column <CODE>A</CODE>
into the InnoDB tablespace consisting of the datafiles you specified
in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>. In addition MySQL will create a file
<TT>`CUSTOMER.frm'</TT> to the MySQL database directory <TT>`test'</TT>.
Internally, InnoDB will add to its own data dictionary an entry
for table <CODE>'test/CUSTOMER'</CODE>. Thus you can create a table
of the same name <CODE>CUSTOMER</CODE> in another database of MySQL, and
the table names will not collide inside InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
You can query the amount of free space in the InnoDB tablespace
by issuing the table status command of MySQL for any table you have
created with <CODE>TYPE = InnoDB</CODE>. Then the amount of free
space in the tablespace appears in the table comment section in the
output of <CODE>SHOW</CODE>. An example:

</P>

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM test LIKE 'CUSTOMER'
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the statistics <CODE>SHOW</CODE> gives about InnoDB tables
are only approximate: they are used in SQL optimisation. Table and
index reserved sizes in bytes are accurate, though.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC457" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC457">7.5.4.1  Converting MyISAM Tables to InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB does not have a special optimisation for separate index creation.
Therefore it does not pay to export and import the table and create indexes
afterwards.
The fastest way to alter a table to InnoDB is to do the inserts
directly to an InnoDB table, that is, use <CODE>ALTER TABLE ... TYPE=INNODB</CODE>,
or create an empty InnoDB table with identical definitions and insert
the rows with <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To get better control over the insertion process, it may be good to insert
big tables in pieces:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable
   WHERE yourkey &#62; something AND yourkey &#60;= somethingelse;
</PRE>

<P>
After all data has been inserted you can rename the tables.

</P>
<P>
During the conversion of big tables you should set the InnoDB
buffer pool size big
to reduce disk I/O. Not bigger than 80% of the physical memory, though.
You should set InnoDB log files big, and also the log buffer large.

</P>
<P>
Make sure you do not run out of tablespace: InnoDB tables take a lot
more space than MyISAM tables. If an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> runs out
of space, it will start a rollback, and that can take hours if it is
disk-bound.
In inserts InnoDB uses the insert buffer to merge secondary index records
to indexes in batches. That saves a lot of disk I/O. In rollback no such
mechanism is used, and the rollback can take 30 times longer than the
insertion.

</P>
<P>
In the case of a runaway rollback, if you do not have valuable data in your
database,
it is better that you kill the database process and delete all InnoDB data
and log files and all InnoDB table <TT>`.frm'</TT> files, and start
your job again, rather than wait for millions of disk I/Os to complete.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC458" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC458">7.5.4.2  Foreign Key Constraints</A></H4>

<P>
Starting from version 3.23.43b InnoDB features foreign key constraints.
InnoDB is the first MySQL table type which allows you to define foreign key
constraints to guard the integrity of your data.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of a foreign key constraint definition in InnoDB:

<PRE>
[CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY (index_col_name, ...)
                  REFERENCES table_name (index_col_name, ...)
                  [ON DELETE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]
                  [ON UPDATE {CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION
                              | RESTRICT}]
</PRE>

<P>
Both tables have to be InnoDB type and <STRONG>there must be an index
where the foreign key and the referenced key are listed as the FIRST
columns</STRONG>. InnoDB does not auto-create indexes on foreign keys or
referenced keys: you have to create them explicitly.

</P>
<P>
Corresponding columns in the foreign key
and the referenced key must have similar internal data types
inside InnoDB so that they can be compared without a type
conversion.
The <STRONG>size and the signedness of integer types has to be the same</STRONG>.
The length of string types need not be the same.
If you specify a <CODE>SET NULL</CODE> action, make sure you
have <STRONG>not declared the columns in the child table</STRONG>
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If MySQL gives the error number 1005 from a <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>
statement, and the error message string refers to errno 150, then
the table creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not
correctly formed.
Similarly, if an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> fails and it refers to errno
150, that means a foreign key definition would be incorrectly
formed for the altered table.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50 you can also associate the
<CODE>ON DELETE CASCADE</CODE> or <CODE>ON DELETE SET NULL</CODE>
clause with the foreign key constraint. Starting from version 4.0.8
you can use also similar <CODE>ON UPDATE</CODE> actions.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>ON DELETE CASCADE</CODE> is specified, and a row in the parent
table is deleted, then InnoDB automatically deletes also all those rows
in the child table whose foreign key values are equal to
the referenced key value in the parent row. If <CODE>ON DELETE SET NULL</CODE>
is specified, the child rows are automatically updated so that the
columns in the foreign key are set to the SQL NULL value.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50, InnoDB does not check foreign key
constraints on those foreign key or referenced key values
which contain a NULL column.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50 the InnoDB parser allows you to
use backquotes (`) around table and column names in the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ...</CODE> clause
but the InnoDB parser is not yet aware of the option
<CODE>lower_case_table_names</CODE> you can specify in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>

<P>
An example:

<PRE>
CREATE TABLE parent(id INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id)) TYPE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE child(id INT, parent_id INT, INDEX par_ind (parent_id),
             FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id)
             ON DELETE SET NULL
) TYPE=INNODB;
</PRE>

<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50 InnoDB allows you to add a new
foreign key constraint to a table through

<PRE>
ALTER TABLE yourtablename
ADD [CONSTRAINT symbol] FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES anothertablename(...)
[on_delete_and_on_update_actions]
</PRE>

<P>
Remember to create the required indexes first, though.
                           
In InnoDB versions &#60; 3.23.50 <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
or <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE>
should not be used in connection with tables which have foreign
key constraints or which are referenced in foreign key constraints:
Any <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> removes all foreign key
constrainst defined for the table. You should not use
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to the referenced table either, but
use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> to modify the
schema. When MySQL does an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> it may internally
use <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>, and that will confuse the
foreign key costraints which refer to the table.
A <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> statement is in MySQL
processed as an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, and these
restrictions apply also to it.

</P>
<P>
When doing foreign key checks InnoDB sets shared row
level locks on child or parent records it has to look at.
InnoDB checks foreign key constraints immediately: the check
is not deferred to transaction commit.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB allows you to drop any table even though that
would break the foreign key constraints which reference
the table. When you drop a table the constraints which
were defined in its create statement are also dropped.

</P>
<P>
If you re-create a table which was dropped, it has to have
a definition which conforms to the foreign key constraints
referencing it. It must have the right column names and types,
and it must have indexes on the referenced keys, as stated above.
If these are not satisfied, MySQL returns error number 1005
and refers to errno 150 in the error message string.

</P>
<P>
Starting from version 3.23.50 InnoDB returns the foreign key
definitions of a table when you call

<PRE>
SHOW CREATE TABLE yourtablename
</PRE>

<P>
Then also <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> produces correct definitions
of tables to the dump file, and does not forget about the
foreign keys.

</P>
<P>
You can also list the foreign key constraints for a table
<CODE>T</CODE> with

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM yourdatabasename LIKE 'T'
</PRE>

<P>
The foreign key constraints are listed in the table comment of
the output.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Adding_and_removing" HREF="manual_toc.html#Adding_and_removing">7.5.5  Adding and Removing InnoDB Data and Log Files</A></H3>

<P>
From version 3.23.50 and 4.0.2 you can specify the last InnoDB datafile
to <CODE>autoextend</CODE>. Alternatively, you can increase to your tablespace
by specifying an additional datafile. To do this you have to shut down
the MySQL server, edit the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> file adding a new datafile
to <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>, and then start the MySQL server again.

</P>
<P>
Currently you cannot remove a datafile from InnoDB. To decrease the
size of your database you have to use <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> to dump
all your tables, create a new database, and import your tables to the
new database.

</P>
<P>
If you want to change the number or the size of your InnoDB log files,
you have to shut down MySQL and make sure that it shuts down without errors.
Then copy the old log files into a safe place just in case something
went wrong in the shutdown and you will need them to recover the
database. Delete then the old log files from the log file directory,
edit <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>, and start MySQL again. InnoDB will tell
you at the startup that it is creating new log files.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Backing_up" HREF="manual_toc.html#Backing_up">7.5.6  Backing up and Recovering an InnoDB Database</A></H3>

<P>
The key to safe database management is taking regular backups.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB Hot Backup is an online backup tool you can use to
backup your InnoDB database while it is running. InnoDB
Hot Backup does not require you to shut down your database
and it does not set any locks or disturb your normal
database processing. InnoDB Hot Backup is a non-free
additional tool which is not included in the standard
MySQL distribution. See the InnoDB Hot Backup homepage
<a HREF="http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html">http://www.innodb.com/hotbackup.html</a>
for detailed information and screenshots. 

</P>
<P>
If you are able to shut down your MySQL server, then to take
a 'binary' backup of your database you have to do the following: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Shut down your MySQL database and make sure it shuts down without errors.
<LI>

Copy all your datafiles into a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all your InnoDB log files to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> configuration file(s) to a safe place.
<LI>

Copy all the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files for your InnoDB tables into a
safe place.
</UL>

<P>
In addition to taking the binary backups described above,
you should also regularly take dumps of your tables with
<TT>`mysqldump'</TT>. The reason to this is that a binary file
may be corrupted without you noticing it. Dumped tables are stored
into text files which are human-readable and much simpler than
database binary files. Seeing table corruption from dumped files
is easier, and since their format is simpler, the chance for
serious data corruption in them is smaller.

</P>
<P>
A good idea is to take the dumps at the same time you take a binary
backup of your database. You have to shut out all clients from your
database to get a consistent snapshot of all your tables into your
dumps. Then you can take the binary backup, and you will then have
a consistent snapshot of your database in two formats.

</P>
<P>
To be able to recover your InnoDB database to the present from the
binary backup described above, you have to run your MySQL database
with the general logging and log archiving of MySQL switched on. Here
by the general logging we mean the logging mechanism of the MySQL server
which is independent of InnoDB logs.

</P>
<P>
To recover from a crash of your MySQL server process, the only thing
you have to do is to restart it. InnoDB will automatically check the
logs and perform a roll-forward of the database to the present.
InnoDB will automatically roll back uncommitted transactions which were
present at the time of the crash. During recovery, InnoDB will print
out something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
~/mysqlm/sql &#62; mysqld
InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally.

</PRE>

<P>
If your database gets corrupted or your disk fails, you have
to do the recovery from a backup. In the case of corruption, you should
first find a backup which is not corrupted. From a backup do the recovery
from the general log files of MySQL according to instructions in the
MySQL manual.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_checkpoints" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_checkpoints">7.5.6.1  Checkpoints</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB implements a checkpoint mechanism called a fuzzy
checkpoint. InnoDB will flush modified database pages from the buffer
pool in small batches, there is no need to flush the buffer pool
in one single batch, which would in practice stop processing
of user SQL statements for a while.

</P>
<P>
In crash recovery InnoDB looks for a checkpoint label written
to the log files. It knows that all modifications to the database
before the label are already present on the disk image of the database.
Then InnoDB scans the log files forward from the place of the checkpoint
applying the logged modifications to the database.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB writes to the log files in a circular fashion.
All committed modifications which make the database pages in the buffer
pool different from the images on disk must be available in the log files
in case InnoDB has to do a recovery. This means that when InnoDB starts
to reuse a log file in the circular fashion, it has to make sure that the
database page images on disk already contain the modifications
logged in the log file InnoDB is going to reuse. In other words, InnoDB
has to make a checkpoint and often this involves flushing of
modified database pages to disk.

</P>
<P>
The above explains why making your log files very big may save
disk I/O in checkpointing. It can make sense to set
the total size of the log files as big as the buffer pool or even bigger.
The drawback in big log files is that crash recovery can last longer
because there will be more log to apply to the database.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Moving" HREF="manual_toc.html#Moving">7.5.7  Moving an InnoDB Database to Another Machine</A></H3>

<P>
InnoDB data and log files are binary-compatible on all platforms
if the floating-point number format on the machines is the same.
You can move an InnoDB database simply by copying all the relevant
files, which we already listed in the previous section on backing up
a database. If the floating-point formats on the machines are
different but you have not used <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
data types in your tables then the procedure is the same: just copy
the relevant files. If the formats are different and your tables
contain floating-point data, you have to use <TT>`mysqldump'</TT>
and <TT>`mysqlimport'</TT> to move those tables.

</P>
<P>
A performance tip is to switch off auto-commit mode when you import
data into your database, assuming your tablespace has enough space for
the big rollback segment the big import transaction will generate.
Do the commit only after importing a whole table or a segment of
a table.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="InnoDB_transaction_model" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_transaction_model">7.5.8  InnoDB Transaction Model</A></H3>

<P>
In the InnoDB transaction model the goal has been to combine the best
properties of a multi-versioning database to traditional two-phase locking.
InnoDB does locking on row level and runs queries by default
as non-locking consistent reads, in the style of Oracle.
The lock table in InnoDB is stored so space-efficiently that lock
escalation is not needed: typically several users are allowed
to lock every row in the database, or any random subset of the rows,
without InnoDB running out of memory.

</P>
<P>
In InnoDB all user activity happens inside transactions. If the
autocommit mode is used in MySQL, then each SQL statement
will form a single transaction.
MySQL always starts a new connection with the autocommit
mode switched on.

</P>
<P>
If the autocommit mode is
switched off with <CODE>SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0</CODE>,
then we can think that a user always has a transaction
open. If he issues
the SQL <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement,
it ends the current transaction, and a new starts. Both statements
will release all InnoDB locks that were set during the
current transaction. A <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> means that the
changes made in the current transaction are made permanent
and become visible to other users. A <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>,
on the other hand, cancels all modifications made by the current
transaction.

</P>
<P>
If the connection has <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT = 1</CODE>, then the user
can still perform a multi-statement transaction by starting it with
<CODE>BEGIN</CODE> and ending it with <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>
or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In terms of the SQL-1992 transaction isolation levels,
the InnoDB default is <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE>.
Starting from version 4.0.5, InnoDB offers all 4 different
transaction isolation levels described by the SQL-1992 standard.
You can set the default isolation level for all connections
in the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> section of <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
transaction-isolation = {READ-UNCOMMITTED | READ-COMMITTED
                         | REPEATABLE-READ | SERIALIZABLE}

</PRE>

<P>
A user can change the isolation level of a single session or
all new incoming connections with the 

<PRE>
SET [SESSION | GLOBAL] TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL
                       {READ UNCOMMITTED | READ COMMITTED
                        | REPEATABLE READ | SERIALIZABLE}
</PRE>

<P>
SQL statement. Note that there are no hyphens in level names
in the SQL syntax.
If you specify the keyword <CODE>GLOBAL</CODE>
in the above statement, it will determine the initial
isolation level of new incoming connections, but will not change
the isolation level of old connections.
Any user is free to change the isolation level of his session, even
in the middle of a transaction.
In versions &#60; 3.23.50 <CODE>SET TRANSACTION</CODE> had no effect
on InnoDB tables. In versions &#60; 4.0.5 only <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE>
and <CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE> were available.

</P>
<P>
You can query the global and session transaction isolation levels with:

<PRE>
SELECT @@global.tx_isolation;
SELECT @@tx_isolation;
</PRE>

<P>
In row level locking InnoDB uses so-called next-key locking.
That means that besides index records, InnoDB can also lock
the 'gap' before an index record to block insertions by other users
immediately before the index record. A next-key lock means
a lock which locks an index record and the gap before it.
A gap lock means a lock which only locks a gap before some
index record.

</P>
<P>
A detailed description of each isolation level in InnoDB:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>READ UNCOMMITTED</CODE> This is also called
'dirty read': non-locking <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are performed
so that we do not look at a possible earlier version of a record; 
thus they are not 'consistent' reads under this isolation level;
otherwise this level works like <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>
Somewhat Oracle-like isolation level.
All <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>
statements
only lock the index records, NOT the gaps before them, and
thus allow free inserting of new records next to locked
records.
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> which use
a unique index with a unique search condition,
only lock the index record found, not the gap before it.
But still in range type
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> InnoDB
must set next-key or gap locks and block insertions
by other users to the
gaps covered by the range. This is necessary
since 'phantom rows' have to be blocked for MySQL
replication and recovery to work.
<STRONG>Consistent reads</STRONG> behave like in
Oracle: each consistent read, even within the same
transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot.
<LI>

<CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> This is the default isolation level of
InnoDB.
<CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>
which use
a unique index with a unique search condition,
only lock the index record found, not the gap before it.
Otherwise these operations employ next-key locking, locking
the index range scanned with next-key or gap locks, and
block new insertions by other users.
In <STRONG>consistent reads</STRONG> there is an important difference
from the previous isolation level: in this level
all consistent reads within the same transaction read the
same snapshot established by the first read. This convention
means that if you issue several plain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s
within the same transaction, these <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are
consistent also with respect to each other.
<LI>

<CODE>SERIALIZABLE</CODE> This level is like
the previous one, but
all plain <CODE>SELECT</CODE>s are implicitly converted to
<CODE>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>.
</UL>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_consistent_read" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_consistent_read">7.5.8.1  Consistent Read</A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read means that InnoDB uses its multi-versioning to
present to a query a snapshot of the database at a point in time.
The query will see the changes made by exactly those transactions
that committed before that point of time, and no changes made by
later or uncommitted transactions. The exception to this rule
is that the query will see the changes made by the transaction
itself which issues the query. 

</P>
<P>
If you are running with the default <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation level,
then all consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot
established by the first such read in that transaction. You can get a
fresher snapshot for your queries by committing the current transaction
and after that issuing new queries. 

</P>
<P>
Consistent read is the default mode in which InnoDB processes
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements in <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE> and
<CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation levels. A consistent read
does not set any locks on the tables it accesses, and
therefore other users are free to modify those tables at
the same time a consistent read is being performed on the table. 

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_locking_reads" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_locking_reads">7.5.8.2  Locking Reads</A></H4>

<P>
A consistent read is not convenient in some circumstances.
Suppose you want to add a new row into your table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and make sure that the child already has a parent in table
<CODE>PARENT</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Suppose you use a consistent read to read the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>
and indeed see the parent of the child in the table. Can you now safely
add the child row to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>? No, because it may
happen that meanwhile some other user has deleted the parent row
from the table <CODE>PARENT</CODE>, and you are not aware of that.

</P>
<P>
The solution is to perform the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> in a locking
mode, <CODE>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>.
  

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM PARENT WHERE NAME = 'Jones' LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
</PRE>

<P>
Performing a read in share mode means that we read the latest
available data, and set a shared mode lock on the rows we read.
If the latest data belongs to a yet uncommitted transaction of another
user, we will wait until that transaction commits.
A shared mode lock prevents others from updating or deleting
the row we have read. After we see that the above query returns
the parent <CODE>'Jones'</CODE>, we can safely add his child
to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>, and commit our transaction.
This example shows how to implement referential
integrity in your application code.

</P>
<P>
Let us look at another example: we have an integer counter field in
a table <CODE>CHILD_CODES</CODE> which we use to assign
a unique identifier to each child we add to table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>.
Obviously, using a consistent read or a shared mode read
to read the present value of the counter is not a good idea, since
then two users of the database may see the same value for the
counter, and we will get a duplicate key error when we add
the two children with the same identifier to the table.

</P>
<P>
In this case there are two good ways to implement the
reading and incrementing of the counter: (1) update the counter
first by incrementing it by 1 and only after that read it,
or (2) read the counter first with
a lock mode <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE>, and increment after that:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT COUNTER_FIELD FROM CHILD_CODES FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE CHILD_CODES SET COUNTER_FIELD = COUNTER_FIELD + 1;
</PRE>

<P>
A <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> will read the latest
available data setting exclusive locks on each row it reads.
Thus it sets the same locks a searched SQL <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> would set
on the rows.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Next-key_locking" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Next-key_locking">7.5.8.3  Next-key Locking: Avoiding the Phantom Problem</A></H4>

<P>
In row level locking InnoDB uses an algorithm called next-key locking.
InnoDB does the row level locking so that when it searches or
scans an index of a table, it sets shared or exclusive locks
on the index records in encounters. Thus the row level locks are
more precisely called index record locks.

</P>
<P>
The locks InnoDB sets on index records also affect the 'gap'
before that index record. If a user has a shared or exclusive
lock on record R in an index, then another user cannot insert
a new index record immediately before R in the index order.
This locking of gaps is done to prevent the so-called phantom
problem. Suppose I want to read and lock all children with identifier
bigger than 100 from table <CODE>CHILD</CODE>,
and update some field in the selected rows.

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose there is an index on table <CODE>CHILD</CODE> on column
<CODE>ID</CODE>. Our query will scan that index starting from
the first record where <CODE>ID</CODE> is bigger than 100.
Now, if the locks set on the index records would not lock out
inserts made in the gaps, a new child might meanwhile be
inserted to the table. If now I in my transaction execute

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM CHILD WHERE ID &#62; 100 FOR UPDATE;
</PRE>

<P>
again, I will see a new child in the result set the query returns.
This is against the isolation principle of transactions:
a transaction should be able to run so that the data
it has read does not change during the transaction. If we regard
a set of rows as a data item, then the new 'phantom' child would break
this isolation principle.

</P>
<P>
When InnoDB scans an index it can also lock the gap
after the last record in the index. Just that happens in the previous
example: the locks set by InnoDB will prevent any insert to
the table where <CODE>ID</CODE> would be bigger than 100.

</P>
<P>
You can use next-key locking to implement a uniqueness
check in your application: if you read your data in share mode
and do not see a duplicate for a row you are going to insert,
then you can safely insert your row and know that the next-key
lock set on the successor of your row during the read will prevent
anyone meanwhile inserting a duplicate for your row. Thus the next-key
locking allows you to 'lock' the non-existence of something in your
table.

</P>

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT ... FROM ... FOR UPDATE</CODE> : sets exclusive next-key locks

<CODE>INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)</CODE> : sets an exclusive lock

on the duplicate index record.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO T SELECT ... FROM S WHERE ...</CODE> sets an exclusive
(non-next-key) lock on each row inserted into <CODE>T</CODE>. Does
the search on <CODE>S</CODE> as a consistent read, but sets shared next-key
locks on <CODE>S</CODE> if the MySQL logging is on. InnoDB has to set
locks in the latter case because in roll-forward recovery from a

If a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraint is defined on a table,

condition sets shared record level locks on the records it
looks at to check the constraint. Also in the case where the

<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES ... </CODE> : sets table locks. In the implementation
the MySQL layer of code sets these locks. The automatic deadlock detection
of InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where such table locks are involved:
see the following section.
Also, since MySQL does know about row level locks,
it is possible that you
get a table lock on a table where another user currently has row level
locks. But that does not put transaction integerity into danger.

<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Deadlock_detection" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Deadlock_detection">7.5.8.5  Deadlock Detection and Rollback</A></H4>

<P>
InnoDB automatically detects a deadlock of transactions and rolls back a
transaction or transactions to prevent the deadlock. Starting from
version 4.0.5, InnoDB will try to pick small transactions to roll
back. The size of a transaction is determined by the number of rows
it has inserted, updated, or deleted. Previous to 4.0.5, InnoDB
always rolled back the transaction whose lock request was the last
one to build a deadlock, that is, a cycle in the waits-for graph
of transactions. 

</P>
<P>
InnoDB cannot detect deadlocks where a lock set by a MySQL
<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> statement is involved, or if a lock set
in another storage engine than InnoDB is involved. You have to resolve
these situations using <CODE>innodb_lock_wait_timeout</CODE> set in
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When InnoDB performs a complete rollback of a transaction, all the
locks of the transaction are released. However, if just a single SQL
statement is rolled back as a result of an error, some of the locks
set by the SQL statement may be preserved. This is because InnoDB
stores row locks in a format where it cannot afterwards know which was
set by which SQL statement.

Suppose you are running on the default <CODE>REPEATABLE READ</CODE> isolation level.
When you issue a consistent read, that is, an ordinary <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statement, InnoDB will give your transaction a timepoint according
to which your query sees the database. Thus, if transaction B deletes

<H4><A NAME="Innodb_deadlocks" HREF="manual_toc.html#Innodb_deadlocks">7.5.8.7  How to cope with deadlocks?</A></H4>

<P>
Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases, but they
are not dangerous, unless they are so frequent that you cannot run
certain transactions at all. Normally you have to write your
applications so that they are always prepared to re-issue a
transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock. 

</P>
<P>
InnoDB uses automatic row level locking. You can get deadlocks
even in the case of transactions which just insert or delete a
single row. That is because these operations are not really 'atomic':
they automatically set locks on the (possibly several) index
records of the row inserted/deleted. 

</P>
<P>
You can cope with deadlocks and reduce the
number of them with the following tricks: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Use <CODE>SHOW INNODB STATUS</CODE> in MySQL versions &#62;= 3.23.52 and &#62;= 4.0.3
to determine the cause of the latest deadlock. That can help you to tune
your application to avoid deadlocks. 
<LI>

Always be prepared to re-issue a transaction if it fails in a
deadlock. Deadlocks are not dangerous. Just try again. 
<LI>

Commit your transactions often. Small transactions are less prone to collide. 
<LI>

If you are using locking reads <CODE>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</CODE>
or <CODE>... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE>, try using a lower isolation
level <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>. 
<LI>

Access your tables and rows in a fixed order. Then transactions will
form nice queues, and do not deadlock. 
<LI>

Add good indexes to your tables. Then your queries need to
scan less index records and consequently set less locks.
Use <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT</CODE> to determine that MySQL picks
appropriate indexes for your queries. 
<LI>

Use less locking: if you can afford a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> to return data
from an old snapshot, do not add the clause <CODE>FOR UPDATE</CODE>
or <CODE>LOCK IN SHARE MODE</CODE> to it. Using <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>
isolation level is good here, because each consistent read
within the same transaction reads from its own fresh snapshot. 
<LI>

If nothing helps, serialize your transactions with table
level locks: <CODE>LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 READ, ... ;
[do something with tables t1 and t2 here]; UNLOCK TABLES</CODE>.
Table level locks make you transactions to queue nicely,
and deadlocks are avoided. Note that <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>
implicitly starts a transaction, just like the command <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>,
and <CODE>UNLOCK TABLES</CODE> implicitly ends the transaction in a <CODE>COMMIT</CODE>. 
<LI>

Another solution to serialize transactions is to create
an auxiliary 'semaphore' table where there is just a
single row. Each transaction updates that row before
accessing other tables. In that way all transactions
happen in a serial fashion. Note that then also the
InnoDB instant deadlock detection algorithm works,
because the serializing lock is a row level lock.
In MySQL table level locks we have to resort to the timeout method to
resolve a deadlock.

<STRONG>1.</STRONG>
If the Unix <TT>`top'</TT> or the Windows <TT>`Task Manager'</TT> shows that
the CPU usage percentage with your workload is less than 70%,
your workload is probably
disk-bound. Maybe you are making too many transaction commits, or the
buffer pool is too small.
Making the buffer pool bigger can help, but do not set
it bigger than 80% of physical memory.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG>
Wrap several modifications into one transaction. InnoDB must
flush the log to disk at each transaction commit, if that transaction
made modifications to the database. Since the rotation speed of a disk

at most 167 revolutions/second, that constrains the number of commits
to the same 167/second if the disk does not fool the operating system.

If you can afford the loss of some latest committed transactions, you can

to zero. InnoDB tries to flush the log anyway once in a second,
though the flush is not guaranteed.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG>
Make your log files big, even as big as the buffer pool. When InnoDB
has written the log files full, it has to write the modified contents
of the buffer pool to disk in a checkpoint. Small log files will cause many
unnecessary disk writes. The drawback in big log files is that recovery
time will be longer.

<STRONG>6.</STRONG> (Relevant from 3.23.39 up.)
In some versions of Linux and Unix, flushing files to disk with the Unix
<CODE>fdatasync</CODE> and other similar methods is surprisingly slow.
The default method InnoDB uses is the <CODE>fdatasync</CODE> function.
If you are not satisfied with the database write performance, you may
try setting <CODE>innodb_flush_method</CODE> in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>

If you use the <TT>`mysqldump'</TT> option <CODE>--opt</CODE>, you will get dump

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG>
Beware of big rollbacks of mass inserts: InnoDB uses the insert buffer
to save disk I/O in inserts, but in a corresponding rollback no such
mechanism is used. A disk-bound rollback can take 30 times the time
of the corresponding insert. Killing the database process will not
help because the rollback will start again at the database startup. The
only way to get rid of a runaway rollback is to increase the buffer pool
so that the rollback becomes CPU-bound and runs fast, or delete the whole
InnoDB database.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG>
Beware also of other big disk-bound operations.
Use <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> (from MySQL-4.0 up) to empty a

<UL>
<LI>

If the section LOCKS HELD
BY TRANSACTIONS reports lock waits, then your application
may have lock contention. The output can also help to
trace reasons for transaction deadlocks.
<LI>

Section SYNC INFO will report reserved semaphores
if you compile InnoDB with <CODE>UNIV_SYNC_DEBUG</CODE>
defined in <TT>`univ.i'</TT>.
<LI>

Section SYNC ARRAY INFO reports threads waiting
for a semaphore and statistics on how many times
threads have needed a spin or a wait on a mutex or
a rw-lock semaphore. A big number of threads waiting
for semaphores may be a result of disk I/O, or
contention problems inside InnoDB. Contention can be
due to heavy parallelism of queries, or problems in
operating system thread scheduling.
<LI>

Section CURRENT PENDING FILE I/O'S lists pending
file I/O requests. A large number of these indicates
that the workload is disk I/O-bound.
<LI>

Section BUFFER POOL gives you statistics
on pages read and written. You can calculate from these
numbers how many datafile I/Os your queries are
currently doing.

<H3><A NAME="Implementation" HREF="manual_toc.html#Implementation">7.5.9  Implementation of Multi-versioning</A></H3>

<P>
Since InnoDB is a multi-versioned database, it must keep information
of old versions of rows in the tablespace. This information is stored
in a data structure we call a rollback segment after an analogous
data structure in Oracle.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB internally adds two fields to each row stored in the database.
A 6-byte field tells the transaction identifier for the last
transaction which inserted or updated the row. Also a deletion
is internally treated as an update where a special bit in the row
is set to mark it as deleted. Each row also contains a 7-byte
field called the roll pointer. The roll pointer points to an
undo log record written to the rollback segment. If the row was
updated, then the undo log record contains the information necessary
to rebuild the content of the row before it was updated.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB uses the information in the rollback segment to perform the
undo operations needed in a transaction rollback. It also uses the
information to build earlier versions of a row for a consistent
read.

</P>
<P>
Undo logs in the rollback segment are divided into insert and update
undo logs. Insert undo logs are only needed in transaction rollback
and can be discarded as soon as the transaction commits. Update undo logs
are used also in consistent reads, and they can be discarded only after
there is no transaction present for which InnoDB has assigned
a snapshot that in a consistent read could need the information
in the update undo log to build an earlier version of a database
row.

</P>
<P>
You must remember to commit your transactions regularly,
also those transactions which only issue consistent reads.
Otherwise
InnoDB cannot discard data from the update undo logs, and the
rollback segment may grow too big, filling up your tablespace.

</P>
<P>
The physical size of an undo log record in the rollback segment
is typically smaller than the corresponding inserted or updated
row. You can use this information to calculate the space need
for your rollback segment.

</P>
<P>
In our multi-versioning scheme a row is not physically removed from
the database immediately when you delete it with an SQL statement.
Only  when InnoDB can discard the update undo log record written for
the deletion, it can also physically remove the corresponding row and
its index records from the database. This removal operation is
called a purge, and it is quite fast, usually taking the same order of
time as the SQL statement which did the deletion.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Table_and_index" HREF="manual_toc.html#Table_and_index">7.5.10  Table and Index Structures</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL stores its data dictionary information of tables
in <TT>`.frm'</TT>
files in database directories. But every InnoDB type table
also has its own entry in InnoDB internal data dictionaries
inside the tablespace. When MySQL drops a table or a database,
it has to delete both a <TT>`.frm'</TT> file or files, and
the corresponding entries inside the InnoDB data dictionary.
This is the reason why you cannot move InnoDB tables between
databases simply by moving the <TT>`.frm'</TT> files, and why
<CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> did not work for InnoDB type tables
in MySQL versions &#60;= 3.23.43.

</P>
<P>
Every InnoDB table has a special index called the clustered index
where the data of the rows is stored. If you define a
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> on your table, then the index of the primary key
will be the clustered index.

</P>
<P>
If you do not define a primary key for
your table, InnoDB will internally generate a clustered index
where the rows are ordered by the row id InnoDB assigns
to the rows in such a table. The row id is a 6-byte field which
monotonically increases as new rows are inserted. Thus the rows
ordered by the row id will be physically in the insertion order.

</P>
<P>
Accessing a row through the clustered index is fast, because
the row data will be on the same page where the index search
leads us. In many databases the data is traditionally stored on a different
page from the index record. If a table is large, the clustered
index architecture often saves a disk I/O when compared to the
traditional solution.

</P>
<P>
The records in non-clustered indexes (we also call them secondary indexes),
in InnoDB contain the primary key value for the row. InnoDB
uses this primary key value to search for the row from the clustered
index. Note that if the primary key is long, the secondary indexes
will use more space.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_physical_structure" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_physical_structure">7.5.10.1  Physical Structure of an Index</A></H4>

<P>
All indexes in InnoDB are B-trees where the index records are
stored in the leaf pages of the tree. The default size of an index
page is 16 kB. When new records are inserted, InnoDB tries to
leave 1 / 16 of the page free for future insertions and updates
of the index records.

</P>
<P>
If index records are inserted in a sequential (ascending or descending)
order, the resulting index pages will be about 15/16 full.
If records are inserted in a random order, then the pages will be
1/2 - 15/16 full. If the fillfactor of an index page drops below 1/2,
InnoDB will try to contract the index tree to free the page.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Insert_buffering" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Insert_buffering">7.5.10.2  Insert Buffering</A></H4>

<P>
It is a common situation in a database application that the
primary key is a unique identifier and new rows are inserted in the
ascending order of the primary key. Thus the insertions to the
clustered index do not require random reads from a disk.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, secondary indexes are usually non-unique and
insertions happen in a relatively random order into secondary indexes.
This would cause a lot of random disk I/Os without a special mechanism
used in InnoDB.

</P>
<P>
If an index record should be inserted to a non-unique secondary index,
InnoDB checks if the secondary index page is already in the buffer
pool. If that is the case, InnoDB will do the insertion directly to
the index page. But, if the index page is not found from the buffer
pool, InnoDB inserts the record to a special insert buffer structure.
The insert buffer is kept so small that it entirely fits in the buffer
pool, and insertions can be made to it very fast.

</P>
<P>
The insert buffer is periodically merged to the secondary index
trees in the database. Often we can merge several insertions on the
same page in of the index tree, and hence save disk I/Os.
It has been measured that the insert buffer can speed up insertions
to a table up to 15 times.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Adaptive_hash" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Adaptive_hash">7.5.10.3  Adaptive Hash Indexes</A></H4>

<P>
If a database fits almost entirely in main memory, then the fastest way
to perform queries on it is to use hash indexes. InnoDB has an
automatic mechanism which monitors index searches made to the indexes
defined for a table, and if InnoDB notices that queries could
benefit from building of a hash index, such an index is automatically
built.

</P>
<P>
But note that the hash index is always built based on an existing
B-tree index on the table. InnoDB can build a hash index on a prefix
of any length of the key defined for the B-tree, depending on
what search pattern InnoDB observes on the B-tree index.
A hash index can be partial: it is not required that the whole
B-tree index is cached in the buffer pool. InnoDB will build
hash indexes on demand to those pages of the index which are
often accessed.

</P>
<P>
In a sense, through the adaptive hash index mechanism InnoDB adapts itself
to ample main memory, coming closer to the architecture of main memory
databases.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Physical_record" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Physical_record">7.5.10.4  Physical Record Structure</A></H4>


<UL>
<LI>

Each index record in InnoDB contains a header of 6 bytes. The header
is used to link consecutive records together, and also in the row level
locking.
<LI>

Records in the clustered index contain fields for all user-defined
columns. In addition, there is a 6-byte field for the transaction id
and a 7-byte field for the roll pointer.

Each secondary index record contains also all the fields defined
for the clustered index key.

A record contains also a pointer to each field of the record.

</UL>



<H4><A NAME="SEC479" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC479">7.5.10.5  How an Auto-increment Column Works in InnoDB</A></H4>

<P>
After a database startup, when a user first does an insert to a
table <CODE>T</CODE>
where an auto-increment column has been defined, and the user does not provide
an explicit value for the column, then InnoDB executes <CODE>SELECT
MAX(auto-inc-column) FROM T</CODE>, and assigns that value incremented
by one to the column and the auto-increment counter of the table.
We say that
the auto-increment counter for table <CODE>T</CODE> has been initialised.

</P>
<P>
InnoDB follows the same procedure in initializing the auto-increment counter
for a freshly created table.

</P>
<P>
Note that if the user specifies in an insert the value 0 to the auto-increment
column, then InnoDB treats the row like the value would not have been
specified.

</P>
<P>
After the auto-increment counter has been initialised, if a user inserts
a row where he explicitly specifies the column value, and the value is bigger
than the current counter value, then the counter is set to the specified
column value. If the user does not explicitly specify a value, then InnoDB
increments the counter by one and assigns its new value to the column.

</P>
<P>
The auto-increment mechanism, when assigning values from the counter,
bypasses locking and transaction handling. Therefore you may also get
gaps in the number sequence if you roll back transactions which have
got numbers from the counter.

</P>
<P>
The behaviour of auto-increment is not defined if a user gives a negative
value to the column or if the value becomes bigger than the maximum
integer that can be stored in the specified integer type.

</P>

<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_Disk_I_O" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_Disk_I_O">7.5.11.1  Disk I/O</A></H4>

<P>
In disk I/O InnoDB uses asynchronous I/O. On Windows NT
it uses the native asynchronous I/O provided by the operating system.
On Unix, InnoDB uses simulated asynchronous I/O built
into InnoDB: InnoDB creates a number of I/O threads to take care
of I/O operations, such as read-ahead. In a future version we will
add support for simulated aio on Windows NT and native aio on those
versions of Unix which have one.

</P>
<P>
On Windows NT InnoDB uses non-buffered I/O. That means that the disk
pages InnoDB reads or writes are not buffered in the operating system
file cache. This saves some memory bandwidth.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41 InnoDB uses a novel file flush technique
called doublewrite.
It adds safety to crash recovery after an operating system crash
or a power outage, and improves performance on most Unix flavors
by reducing the need for fsync operations.

</P>
<P>
Doublewrite means that InnoDB before writing pages to a datafile
first writes them to a contiguous tablespace area called the
doublewrite buffer. Only after the write and the flush to the doublewrite
buffer has completed, InnoDB writes the pages to their proper
positions in the datafile. If the operating system crashes in the
middle of a page write, InnoDB will in recovery find a good
copy of the page from the doublewrite buffer.

</P>
<P>
Starting from 3.23.41
you can also use a raw disk partition as a datafile, though this has
not been tested yet. When you create a new datafile you have
to put the keyword <CODE>newraw</CODE> immediately after the data
file-size in <CODE>innodb_data_file_path</CODE>. The partition must be
&#62;= than you specify as the size. Note that 1M in InnoDB is
1024 x 1024 bytes, while in disk specifications 1 MB usually means
1000 000 bytes.

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:5Gnewraw;hdd2:2Gnewraw
</PRE>

<P>
When you start the database again you <STRONG>must</STRONG> change the keyword
to <CODE>raw</CODE>. Otherwise, InnoDB will write over your
partition!

</P>

<PRE>
innodb_data_file_path=hdd1:5Graw;hdd2:2Graw
</PRE>

<P>
By using a raw disk you can on some Unixes perform unbuffered I/O.

</P>
<P>
There are two read-ahead heuristics in InnoDB: sequential read-ahead
and random read-ahead. In sequential read-ahead InnoDB notices that
the access pattern to a segment in the tablespace is sequential.
Then InnoDB will post in advance a batch of reads of database pages to the
I/O system. In random read-ahead InnoDB notices that some area
in a tablespace seems to be in the process of being
fully read into the buffer pool. Then InnoDB posts the remaining
reads to the I/O system.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_space" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_space">7.5.11.2  File Space Management</A></H4>

<P>
The datafiles you define in the configuration file form the tablespace
of InnoDB. The files are simply catenated to form the tablespace,
there is no striping in use.
Currently you cannot directly instruct where the space is allocated
for your tables, except by using the following fact: from a newly created
tablespace InnoDB will allocate space starting from the low end.

</P>
<P>
The tablespace consists of database pages whose default size is 16 kB.
The pages are grouped into extents of 64 consecutive pages. The 'files' inside
a tablespace are called segments in InnoDB. The name of the rollback
segment is somewhat misleading because it actually contains many
segments in the tablespace.

</P>
<P>
For each index in InnoDB we allocate two segments: one is for non-leaf
nodes of the B-tree, the other is for the leaf nodes. The idea here is
to achieve better sequentiality for the leaf nodes, which contain the
data.

</P>
<P>
When a segment grows inside the tablespace, InnoDB allocates the
first 32 pages to it individually. After that InnoDB starts
to allocate whole extents to the segment.
InnoDB can add to a large segment up to 4 extents at a time to ensure
good sequentiality of data.

</P>
<P>
Some pages in the tablespace contain bitmaps of other pages, and
therefore a few extents in an InnoDB tablespace cannot be
allocated to segments as a whole, but only as individual pages.

</P>
<P>
When you issue a query <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM ... LIKE ...</CODE>
to ask for available free space in the tablespace, InnoDB will
report the extents which are definitely free in the tablespace.
InnoDB always reserves some extents for clean-up and other internal
purposes; these reserved extents are not included in the free space.

</P>
<P>
When you delete data from a table, InnoDB will contract the corresponding
B-tree indexes. It depends on the pattern of deletes if that frees
individual pages or extents to the tablespace, so that the freed
space is available for other users. Dropping a table or deleting
all rows from it is guaranteed to release the space to other users,
but remember that deleted rows can be physically removed only in a
purge operation after they are no longer needed in transaction rollback or
consistent read.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="InnoDB_File_Defragmenting" HREF="manual_toc.html#InnoDB_File_Defragmenting">7.5.11.3  Defragmenting a Table</A></H4>

<P>
If there are random insertions or deletions
in the indexes of a table, the indexes
may become fragmented. By fragmentation we mean that the physical ordering
of the index pages on the disk is not close to the alphabetical ordering
of the records on the pages, or that there are many unused pages in the
64-page blocks which were allocated to the index.

</P>
<P>
It can speed up index scans if you
periodically use <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> to dump the table to
a text file, drop the table, and reload it from the dump.
Another way to do the defragmenting is to <CODE>ALTER</CODE> the table type to
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and back to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> again.
Note that a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table must fit in a single file
on your operating system.

</P>
<P>
If the insertions to and index are always ascending and
records are deleted only from the end, then the file space management
algorithm of InnoDB guarantees that fragmentation in the index will
not occur.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="Error_handling" HREF="manual_toc.html#Error_handling">7.5.12  Error Handling</A></H3>

<P>
The error handling in InnoDB is not always the same as
specified in the ANSI SQL standards. According to the ANSI
standard, any error during an SQL statement should cause the
rollback of that statement. InnoDB sometimes rolls back only
part of the statement, or the whole transaction.
The following list specifies the error handling of InnoDB.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you run out of file space in the tablespace,
you will get the MySQL <CODE>'Table is full'</CODE> error
and InnoDB rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

A transaction deadlock or a timeout in a lock wait make InnoDB
to roll back
the whole transaction.
<LI>

A duplicate key error only rolls back the insert of that particular row,
even in a statement like <CODE>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
This will probably change so that the SQL statement will be rolled
back if you have not specified the <CODE>IGNORE</CODE> option in your
statement.
<LI>

A 'row too long' error rolls back the SQL statement.
<LI>

Other errors are mostly detected by the MySQL layer of code, and
they roll back the corresponding SQL statement.

<LI>

<CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> is not supported for InnoDB tables.
<LI>

The MySQL <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> operation does not know of InnoDB
row level locks set in already completed SQL statements: this means that
you can get a table lock on a table even if there still exist transactions
of other users which have row level locks on the same table. Thus
your operations on the table may have to wait if they collide with
these locks of other users. Also a deadlock is possible. However,
this does not endanger transaction integrity, because the row level
locks set by InnoDB will always take care of the integrity.
Also, a table lock prevents other transactions from acquiring more
row level locks (in a conflicting lock mode) on the table.
<LI>

You cannot have a key on a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>TEXT</CODE> column.
<LI>

A table cannot contain more than 1000 columns.

<CODE>DELETE FROM TABLE</CODE> does not regenerate the table but instead
deletes all rows, one by one, which is not that fast. In future versions
of MySQL you can use <CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> which is fast.
<LI>

The default database page size in InnoDB is 16 kB. By recompiling the
code one can set it from 8 kB to 64 kB.
The maximun row length is slightly less than half of a database page
in versions &#60;= 3.23.40 of InnoDB. Starting from source
release 3.23.41 BLOB and

Also existing tables reserve less space. By upgrading to 4.0.8
you will see more free space in "InnoDB free" in SHOW TABLE STATUS.

Many CPU-bound join queries now run faster. On Windows also many
other CPU-bound queries run faster.
<LI>

A new SQL command SHOW INNODB STATUS returns the output of the
InnoDB Monitor to the client. The InnoDB Monitor now prints detailed info on
the latest detected deadlock.
<LI>

InnoDB made the SQL query optimizer to avoid too much index-only
range scans and choose full table scans instead. This is now fixed.
<LI>

"BEGIN" and "COMMIT" are now added in the binlog around transactions.
The MySQL replication now respects transaction borders:
a user will no longer see half transactions in replication slaves.
<LI>

A replication slave now prints in crash recovery the last
master binlog position it was able to recover to.
<LI>

A new setting innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2 makes InnoDB to write
the log to the operating system file cache at each commit. This is
almost as fast as the setting innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0, and
the setting 2 also has the nice feature that in a crash where the
operating system does not crash, no committed transaction is lost.
If the operating system crashes or there is a power outage, then
the setting 2 is no safer than the setting 0.
<LI>

Added checksum fields to log blocks.
<LI>

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 helps in importing tables
in an arbitrary order which does not respect the foreign key rules.
<LI>

SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0 speeds up table imports into InnoDB
if you have UNIQUE constraints on secondary indexes.
<LI>

SHOW TABLE STATUS now lists also possible ON DELETE CASCADE or
ON DELETE SET NULL in the comment field of the table.
<LI>

When CHECK TABLE is run on any InnoDB type table, it now
checks also the adaptive hash index for all tables.
<LI>

If you defined ON DELETE CASCADE or SET NULL and updated the
referenced key in the parent row, InnoDB deleted or updated
the child row. This is now changed to conform to SQL-92: you get
the error 'Cannot delete parent row'.
<LI>

Improved the auto-increment algorithm: now the first insert or
SHOW TABLE STATUS initializes the auto-inc counter for the table.
This removes almost all surprising deadlocks caused by
SHOW TABLE STATUS.
<LI>

Aligned some buffers used in reading and writing to data files.
This allows using unbuffered raw devices as data files in Linux.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you updated the primary key of a table so that only the
case of characters changed, that could cause assertion
failures, mostly in page0page.ic line 515.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you delete or update a row referenced in a foreign key
constraint and the foreign key check has to wait for a lock,
then the check may report an erroneous result. This
affects also the ON DELETE... operation.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: A deadlock or a lock wait timeout error in InnoDB
causes InnoDB to roll back the whole transaction, but MySQL could still
write the earlier SQL statements to the binlog, even though
InnoDB rolled them back. This could, for example, cause replicated
databases to get out-of-sync.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If the database happened to crash in the middle of a
commit, then the recovery might leak tablespace pages.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you specified a non-latin1 character set in my.cnf,
then, in contrary to what is stated in the manual, in a foreign key
constraint a string type column had to have the same length specification
in the referencing table and the referenced table.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: DROP TABLE or DROP DATABASE could fail if there
simultaneously was a CREATE TABLE running.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: If you configured the buffer pool bigger than 2 GB in
a 32-bit computer, InnoDB would assert in buf0buf.ic line 214.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: on 64-bit computers updating rows which contained the
SQL NULL in some column could cause the undo log and the ordinary
log to become corrupt.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: in the HP-UX-10.20 version mutexes would leak and cause
race conditions and crashes in any part of InnoDB code.

InnoDB now supports an auto-extending last data file. You do not need
to preallocate the whole data file at the database startup.
<LI>

Made several changes to facilitate the use of the InnoDB Hot Backup
tool. It is a separate non-free tool you can use to take online backups
of your database without shutting down the server or setting
any locks.
<LI>

If you want to run the InnoDB Hot Backup tool on an auto-extending
data file you have to upgrade it to version ibbackup-0.35.
<LI>

The log scan phase in crash recovery will now run much faster.
<LI>

Starting from this server version, the hot backup tool
truncates unused ends in the backup InnoDB data files.
<LI>

To allow the hot backup tool to work, on Windows we no longer use
unbuffered i/o or native async i/o; instead we use the same simulated
async i/o as on Unix.
<LI>

You can now define the ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL
clause on foreign keys.
<LI>

FOREIGN KEY constraints now survive ALTER TABLE and CREATE
INDEX.
<LI>

We suppress the FOREIGN KEY check if any of the column values in the
foreign key or referenced key to be checked is the SQL NULL. This
is compatible with Oracle, for example.
<LI>

SHOW CREATE TABLE now lists also foreign key constraints. Also
mysqldump no longer forgets about foreign keys in table definitions.
<LI>

You can now add a new foreign key constraint with
ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... (...).
<LI>

FOREIGN KEY definitions now allow backquotes around table and
column names.
<LI>

MySQL command
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...
has now the following effect on
InnoDB tables: if a transaction is defined as SERIALIZABLE
then InnoDB conceptually adds LOCK IN SHARE MODE
to all consistent reads. If a transaction is defined to have any other
isolation level, then InnoDB obeys its default locking strategy
which is REPEATABLE READ.
<LI>

SHOW TABLE STATUS no longer sets an x-lock at the end of an
auto-increment index if the auto-increment counter has already
been initialized. This removes in almost all cases the surprising deadlocks
caused by SHOW TABLE STATUS.

If MySQL binlogging is used,

is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: calling SHOW CREATE TABLE or SHOW TABLE STATUS
could cause memory corruption and make mysqld to crash.
Especially at risk was mysqldump, because it calls frequently
SHOW CREATE TABLE.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if on Unix you did an ALTER TABLE to an InnoDB table and
simultaneously did queries to it, mysqld could crash with an assertion
failure in row0row.c, line 474.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if inserts to several tables containing an auto-inc column
were wrapped inside one LOCK TABLES, InnoDB asserted in lock0lock.c.
<LI>

In 3.23.47 we allowed several NULLS in a UNIQUE secondary index.
But CHECK TABLE was not relaxed: it reports the table as corrupt.
CHECK TABLE no longer complains in this situation.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: on Sparc and other high-endian processors SHOW VARIABLES
showed innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit and other boolean-valued
startup parameters always OFF even if they were switched on. 
<LI>

Fixed a bug: if you ran mysqld-max-nt as a service on Windows NT/2000,
the service shutdown did not always wait long enough for the InnoDB shutdown
to finish.

<UL>
<LI>

Recovery happens now faster, especially in a lightly loaded system,
because background checkpointing has been made more frequent.
<LI>

InnoDB allows now several similar key values in a UNIQUE secondary index
if those values contain SQL NULLs. Thus the convention is now the same as in
MyISAM tables.
<LI>

InnoDB gives a better row count estimate for a table which contains BLOBs.
<LI>

In a FOREIGN KEY constraint InnoDB is now case-insensitive to column
names, and in Windows also to table names.
<LI>

InnoDB allows a FOREIGN KEY column of CHAR type to refer to a column of
VARCHAR type, and vice versa. MySQL silently changes the type of some
columns between CHAR and VARCHAR, and these silent changes do not hinder
FOREIGN KEY declaration any more.
<LI>

Recovery has been made more resilient to corruption of log files.
<LI>

Unnecessary statistics calculation has been removed from queries which
generate a temporary table. Some ORDER BY and DISTINCT queries will now run
much faster.
<LI>

MySQL now knows that the table scan of an InnoDB table is done through the
primary key. This will save a sort in some ORDER BY queries.
<LI>

The maximum key length of InnoDB tables is again restricted to 500 bytes.
The MySQL interpreter is not able to handle longer keys.
<LI>

The default value of innodb_lock_wait_timeout was changed from infinite to
50 seconds, the default value of innodb_file_io_threads from 9
to 4.

This is a bugfix release.
<LI>

In versions 3.23.42-.44 when creating a table on Windows you
have to use lower case letters in the database name to be able to
access the table. Fixed in 3.23.45.
<LI>

InnoDB now flushes stdout and stderr every 10 seconds: if these
are redirected to files, the file contents can be better viewed with
an editor.
<LI>

Fixed an assertion failure in .44, in trx0trx.c, line 178
when you drop a table which has
the .frm file but does not exist inside InnoDB.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the insert buffer.
The insert buffer tree could get into an inconsistent state, causing a crash,
and also crashing the recovery. This bug could appear especially in
large table imports or alterations.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in recovery: InnoDB could go into an infinite loop
constantly printing
a warning message that it cannot find free blocks from the buffer pool.
<LI>

Fixed a bug: when you created a temporary table of the InnoDB type, and then
used ALTER TABLE to it, the MySQL server could crash.
<LI>

Prevented creation of MySQL system tables 'mysql.user',
'mysql.host', or 'mysql.db', in the
InnoDB type.

You can define foreign key constraints on InnoDB
tables. An example: FOREIGN KEY (col1) REFERENCES table2(col2).
<LI>

You can create &#62; 4 GB data files in those
file systems that allow it.
<LI>

Improved InnoDB monitors, including a new innodb_table_monitor
which allows you to print the contents of the InnoDB internal data
dictionary.
<LI>

DROP DATABASE will now work also for InnoDB tables.
<LI>

Accent characters in the default character set
latin1 will be ordered according to the MySQL ordering.&#60;br&#62;
NOTE: if you are using latin1 and have inserted characters
whose code is &#62; 127 to an indexed CHAR column, you should run
CHECK TABLE on your table when you upgrade to
3.23.43, and drop and reimport the table if CHECK TABLE
reports an error!
<LI>

InnoDB will calculate better table cardinality
estimates.
<LI>

Change in deadlock resolution:
in .43 a deadlock rolls back only the
SQL statement, in .44 it will roll back the whole transaction.
<LI>

Deadlock, lock wait timeout, and foreign key
constraint violations (no parent row, child rows exist)
now return native MySQL
error codes 1213, 1205, 1216, 1217, respectively.
<LI>

A new my.cnf parameter innodb_thread_concurrency
helps in performance tuning in high concurrency environments.
<LI>

A new my.cnf option innodb_force_recovery will
help you in dumping tables from a corrupted database.
<LI>

A new my.cnf option innodb_fast_shutdown will
speed up shutdown. Normally InnoDB does a full purge
and an insert buffer merge at shutdown.

<H3><A NAME="BDB_overview" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_overview">7.6.1  Overview of <CODE>BDB</CODE> Tables</A></H3>

<P>
BerkeleyDB, available at <a HREF="http://www.sleepycat.com/">http://www.sleepycat.com/</a> has provided
MySQL with a transactional storage engine. Support for this storage engine is
included in the MySQL source distribution starting from version 3.23.34 and is
activated in the MySQL-Max binary. This storage engine is typically called
<CODE>BDB</CODE> for short.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes and are also
capable of <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> operations on transactions.
The MySQL source distribution comes with a <CODE>BDB</CODE> distribution that has a
couple of small patches to make it work more smoothly with MySQL.
You can't use a non-patched <CODE>BDB</CODE> version with MySQL.

</P>
<P>
We at MySQL AB are working in close cooperation with Sleepycat to
keep the quality of the MySQL/BDB interface high.

</P>
<P>
When it comes to supporting <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, we are committed to help our
users to locate the problem and help creating a reproducible test case
for any problems involving <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.  Any such test case will be
forwarded to Sleepycat who in turn will help us find and fix the
problem.  As this is a two-stage operation, any problems with <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables
may take a little longer for us to fix than for other storage engines.
However, as the BerkeleyDB code itself has been used by many other
applications than MySQL, we don't envision any big problems with
this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Support">1.4.1  Support Offered by MySQL AB</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="BDB_install" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_install">7.6.2  Installing <CODE>BDB</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
If you have downloaded a binary version of MySQL that includes
support for BerkeleyDB, simply follow the instructions for installing a
binary version of MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_binary">2.2.10  Installing a MySQL Binary Distribution</A>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld-max">4.7.5  <CODE>mysqld-max</CODE>, An Extended <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
To compile MySQL with Berkeley DB support, download MySQL
Version 3.23.34 or newer and configure <CODE>MySQL</CODE> with the
<CODE>--with-berkeley-db</CODE> option.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source">2.3  Installing a MySQL Source Distribution</A>.

</P>

</PRE>

<P>
Please refer to the manual provided with the <CODE>BDB</CODE> distribution for
more updated information.

</P>
<P>
Even though Berkeley DB is in itself very tested and reliable,
the MySQL interface is still considered beta quality.
We are actively improving and optimising it to get it stable very
soon.

<H3><A NAME="BDB_characteristics" HREF="manual_toc.html#BDB_characteristics">7.6.4  Characteristics of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables:</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

To be able to rollback transactions, the <CODE>BDB</CODE> storage engine maintains
log files.  For maximum performance you should place these on another disk
than your databases by using the <CODE>--bdb-logdir</CODE> option.
<LI>

MySQL performs a checkpoint each time a new <CODE>BDB</CODE> log
file is started, and removes any log files that are not needed for
current transactions.  One can also run <CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> at any time
to checkpoint the Berkeley DB tables.

For disaster recovery, one should use table backups plus
MySQL's binary log. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Backup">4.4.1  Database Backups</A>.

<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: If you delete old log files that are in use, <CODE>BDB</CODE> will
not be able to do recovery at all and you may lose data if something
goes wrong.
<LI>

MySQL requires a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in each <CODE>BDB</CODE> table to be
able to refer to previously read rows. If you don't create one,
MySQL will create an maintain a hidden <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> for
you.  The hidden key has a length of 5 bytes and is incremented for each
insert attempt.
<LI>

If all columns you access in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table are part of the same index or
part of the primary key, then MySQL can execute the query
without having to access the actual row.  In a <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table the
above holds only if the columns are part of the same index.
<LI>

The <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be faster than any other key, as the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> is stored together with the row data.  As the other keys are
stored as the key data + the <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE>, it's important to keep the
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> as short as possible to save disk and get better speed.
<LI>

<CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> works on <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables as with other tables.  If
you don't use <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE>, MySQL will issue an internal
multiple-write lock on the table to ensure that the table will be
properly locked if another thread issues a table lock.
<LI>

Internal locking in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables is done on page level.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name</CODE> is slow as <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables doesn't
maintain a count of the number of rows in the table.
<LI>

Sequential scanning is slower than with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables as the data in
<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables stored in B-trees and not in a separate datafile.
<LI>

The application must always be prepared to handle cases where
any change of a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table may make an automatic rollback and any
read may fail with a deadlock error.
<LI>

Keys are not prefix or suffix-compressed like keys in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables. In other words, the key information will take a little more
space in <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables compared to <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

There are often holes in the <CODE>BDB</CODE> table to allow you to insert new rows in
the middle of the key tree.  This makes <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables somewhat larger than
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.
<LI>

The optimiser needs to know an approximation of the number of rows in
the table.  MySQL solves this by counting inserts and
maintaining this in a separate segment in each <CODE>BDB</CODE> table.  If you don't
issue a lot of <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statements, this number
should be accurate enough for the MySQL optimiser, but as MySQL
only stores the number on close, it may be incorrect if MySQL dies
unexpectedly. It should not be fatal even if this number is not 100%
correct.  One can update the number of rows by executing <CODE>ANALYZE
TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#ANALYZE_TABLE">4.5.2  <CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A> . See section <A HREF="manual.html#OPTIMIZE_TABLE">4.5.1  <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

If you get full disk with a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, you will get an error
(probably error 28) and the transaction should roll back.  This is in
contrast with <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
wait for enough free disk before continuing.

<UL>
<LI>

It's very slow to open many <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables at the same time. If you are
going to use <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you should not have a very big table cache
(like &#62;256) and you should use <CODE>--no-auto-rehash</CODE> with the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
client.  We plan to partly fix this in 4.0.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>BDB</CODE> tables store in the <TT>`.db'</TT> file the path to the file as it was
created.
(This was done to be able to detect locks in a multi-user environment that
supports symlinks).

The effect of this is that <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables are not movable between directories!
<LI>

When taking backups of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, you have to either use
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE> or take a backup of all <CODE>table_name.db</CODE> files and
the <CODE>BDB</CODE> log files.  The <CODE>BDB</CODE> log files are the files in the base

in another transaction, you may get the following error messages in your MySQL
error log:


<PRE>
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  Missing log fileid entry
001119 23:43:56  bdb:  txn_abort: Log undo failed for LSN:
                       1 3644744: Invalid
</PRE>

This is not fatal but we don't recommend that you delete tables if you are
not in auto-commit mode, until this problem is fixed (the fix is
not trivial).

PHP is a server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language that may be used to
create dynamic web pages.  It contains support for accessing several
databases, including MySQL.  PHP may be run as a separate program
or compiled as a module for use with the Apache web server.

<LI>Error: "Maximum Execution Time Exceeded"

This is a PHP limit; go into the <TT>`php3.ini'</TT> file and set the maximum
execution time up from 30 seconds to something higher, as needed.
It is also not a bad idea to double the ram allowed per script to 16MB instead of
8 MB.
<LI>Error: "Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function mysql_connect() in .."

This means that your PHP version isn't compiled with MySQL support.
You can either compile a dynamic MySQL module and load it into PHP or
recompile PHP with built-in MySQL support.  This is described in
detail in the PHP manual.
<LI>Error: "undefined reference to `uncompress'"

This means that the client library is compiled with support for a compressed
client/server protocol. The fix is to add <CODE>-lz</CODE> last when linking
with <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE>.

<CODE>DBI</CODE> is a generic interface for many databases. That means that
you can write a script that works with many different database engines
without change. You need a DataBase Driver (DBD) defined for each
database type. For MySQL, this driver is called
<CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE>.

The Perl methods are described in more detail in the following sections.
Variables used for method return values have these meanings:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$dbh</CODE>
<DD>
Database handle

<DT><CODE>$sth</CODE>
<DD>
Statement handle

<DT><CODE>$rc</CODE>
<DD>
Return code (often a status)

<DT><CODE>$rv</CODE>
<DD>
Return value (often a row count)
</DL>

<P>
<STRONG>Portable DBI Methods</STRONG>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>connect($data_source, $username, $password)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1556"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1557"></A>
 
Use the <CODE>connect</CODE> method to make a database connection to the data
source. The <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value should begin with
<CODE>DBI:driver_name:</CODE>.
Example uses of <CODE>connect</CODE> with the <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> driver:

<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database", $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname",
                    $user, $password);
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:$hostname:$port",
                    $user, $password);
</PRE>

If the user name and/or password are undefined, <CODE>DBI</CODE> uses the
values of the <CODE>DBI_USER</CODE> and <CODE>DBI_PASS</CODE> environment variables,
respectively. If you don't specify a hostname, it defaults to
<CODE>'localhost'</CODE>. If you don't specify a port number, it defaults to the
default MySQL port (3306).

As of <CODE>Msql-Mysql-modules</CODE> Version 1.2009,
the <CODE>$data_source</CODE> value allows certain modifiers:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_file=file_name</CODE>
<DD>
Read <TT>`filename'</TT> as an option file.  For information on option files,
see section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<DT><CODE>mysql_read_default_group=group_name</CODE>
<DD>
The default group when reading an option file is normally the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> group.  By specifying the <CODE>mysql_read_default_group</CODE>
option, the default group becomes the <CODE>[group_name]</CODE> group.

<DT><CODE>mysql_compression=1</CODE>
<DD>
Use compressed communication between the client and server (MySQL
Version 3.22.3 or later).

<DT><CODE>mysql_socket=/path/to/socket</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the pathname of the Unix socket that is used to connect
to the server (MySQL Version 3.21.15 or later).
</DL>

Multiple modifiers may be given; each must be preceded by a semicolon.

For example, if you want to avoid hardcoding the user name and password into
a <CODE>DBI</CODE> script, you can take them from the user's <TT>`~/.my.cnf'</TT>
option file instead by writing your <CODE>connect</CODE> call like this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

This call will read options defined for the <CODE>[client]</CODE> group in the
option file.  If you wanted to do the same thing but use options specified
for the <CODE>[perl]</CODE> group as well, you could use this:


<PRE>
$dbh = DBI-&#62;connect("DBI:mysql:$database"
                . ";mysql_read_default_file=$ENV{HOME}/.my.cnf"
                . ";mysql_read_default_group=perl",
                $user, $password);
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1558"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1559"></A>
<DT><CODE>disconnect</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>disconnect</CODE> method disconnects the database handle from the database.
This is typically called right before you exit from the program.
Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $dbh-&#62;disconnect;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1560"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1561"></A>
<DT><CODE>prepare($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
Prepares a SQL statement for execution by the database engine
and returns a statement handle <CODE>($sth)</CODE>, which you can use to invoke
the <CODE>execute</CODE> method.

Typically you handle <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements (and <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like
statements such as <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>) by
means of <CODE>prepare</CODE> and <CODE>execute</CODE>.  Example:


<PRE>
$sth = $dbh-&#62;prepare($statement)
    or die "Can't prepare $statement: $dbh-&#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

If you want to read big results to your client you can tell Perl to use
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> with:


<PRE>
my $sth = $dbh-&#62;prepare($statement { "mysql_use_result" =&#62; 1});
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1562"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1563"></A>
<DT><CODE>execute</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>execute</CODE> method executes a prepared statement. For
non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns the number of rows
affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>"0E0"</CODE>,
which Perl treats as zero but regards as true. If an error occurs,
<CODE>execute</CODE> returns <CODE>undef</CODE>. For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements,
<CODE>execute</CODE> only starts the SQL query in the database; you need to use one
of the <CODE>fetch_*</CODE> methods described here to retrieve the data.
Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;execute
          or die "can't execute the query: $sth-&#62;errstr;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1564"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1565"></A>
<DT><CODE>do($statement)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>do</CODE> method prepares and executes a SQL statement and returns the
number of rows affected.  If no rows are affected, <CODE>do</CODE> returns
<CODE>"0E0"</CODE>, which Perl treats as zero but regards as true.  This method is
generally used for non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements that cannot be prepared in
advance (due to driver limitations) or that do not need to be executed more
than once (inserts, deletes, etc.). Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $dbh-&#62;do($statement)
        or die "Can't execute $statement: $dbh- &#62;errstr\n";
</PRE>

Generally the 'do' statement is much faster (and is preferable)
than prepare/execute for statements that don't contain parameters.

<A NAME="IDX1566"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1567"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1568"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1569"></A>
<DT><CODE>quote($string)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>quote</CODE> method is used to "escape" any special characters contained in
the string and to add the required outer quotation marks.
Example:

<PRE>
$sql = $dbh-&#62;quote($string)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1570"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1571"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_array</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as an array of
field values.  Example:

<PRE>
while(@row = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_array) {
        print qw($row[0]\t$row[1]\t$row[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1572"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1573"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches the next row of data and returns it as a reference
to an array of field values. Example:

<PRE>
while($row_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_arrayref) {
        print qw($row_ref-&#62;[0]\t$row_ref-&#62;[1]\t$row_ref-&#62;[2]\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1574"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1575"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchrow_hashref</CODE>
<DD>
This method fetches a row of data and returns a reference to a hash
table containing field name/value pairs. This method is not nearly as
efficient as using array references as demonstrated above. Example:

<PRE>
while($hash_ref = $sth-&#62;fetchrow_hashref) {
        print qw($hash_ref-&#62;{firstname}\t$hash_ref-&#62;{lastname}\t\
                $hash_ref-&#62;{title}\n);
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1576"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1577"></A>
<DT><CODE>fetchall_arrayref</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used to get all the data (rows) to be returned from the
SQL statement. It returns a reference to an array of references to arrays
for each row. You access or print the data by using a nested
loop. Example:

<PRE>
my $table = $sth-&#62;fetchall_arrayref
                or die "$sth-&#62;errstr\n";
my($i, $j);
for $i ( 0 .. $#{$table} ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$table-&#62;[$i]} ) {
                print "$table-&#62;[$i][$j]\t";
        }
        print "\n";
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1578"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1579"></A>
<DT><CODE>finish</CODE>
<DD>
Indicates that no more data will be fetched from this statement
handle. You call this method to free up the statement handle and any
system resources associated with it.  Example:

<PRE>
$rc = $sth-&#62;finish;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1580"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1581"></A>
<DT><CODE>rows</CODE>
<DD>
Returns the number of rows changed (updated, deleted, etc.) by the last
command.  This is usually used after a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> <CODE>execute</CODE>
statement.  Example:

<PRE>
$rv = $sth-&#62;rows;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1582"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1583"></A>
<DT><CODE>NULLABLE</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of values that indicate whether columns may
contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
The possible values for each array element are 0 or the empty string if the
column cannot be <CODE>NULL</CODE>, 1 if it can, and 2 if the column's <CODE>NULL</CODE>
status is unknown.
Example:

<PRE>
$null_possible = $sth-&#62;{NULLABLE};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1584"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1585"></A>
<DT><CODE>NUM_OF_FIELDS</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute indicates
the number of fields returned by a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>
statement.  You may use this for checking whether a statement returned a
result: A zero value indicates a non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> statement like
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$nr_of_fields = $sth-&#62;{NUM_OF_FIELDS};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1586"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1587"></A>
<DT><CODE>data_sources($driver_name)</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns an array containing names of databases available to the
MySQL server on the host <CODE>'localhost'</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
@dbs = DBI-&#62;data_sources("mysql");
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1588"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1589"></A>
<DT><CODE>ChopBlanks</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute determines whether the <CODE>fetchrow_*</CODE> methods will chop
leading and trailing blanks from the returned values.
Example:

<PRE>
$sth-&#62;{'ChopBlanks'} =1;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1590"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1591"></A>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>trace($trace_level, $trace_filename)</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>trace</CODE> method enables or disables tracing.  When invoked as a
<CODE>DBI</CODE> class method, it affects tracing for all handles.  When invoked as
a database or statement handle method, it affects tracing for the given
handle (and any future children of the handle).  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE>
to 2 provides detailed trace information.  Setting <CODE>$trace_level</CODE> to 0
disables tracing.  Trace output goes to the standard error output by
default.  If <CODE>$trace_filename</CODE> is specified, the file is opened in
append mode and output for <STRONG>all</STRONG> traced handles is written to that
file.  Example:

<PRE>
DBI-&#62;trace(2);                # trace everything
DBI-&#62;trace(2,"/tmp/dbi.out"); # trace everything to
                              # /tmp/dbi.out
$dth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this database handle
$sth-&#62;trace(2);               # trace this statement handle
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1592"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1593"></A>
You can also enable <CODE>DBI</CODE> tracing by setting the <CODE>DBI_TRACE</CODE>
environment variable.  Setting it to a numeric value is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(value)</CODE>.  Setting it to a pathname is equivalent to calling
<CODE>DBI-&#62;(2,value)</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>insertid</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1594"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1595"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX1596"></A>
 
If you use the <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> feature of MySQL, the new
auto-incremented values will be stored here.
Example:

<PRE>
$new_id = $sth-&#62;{insertid};
</PRE>

As an alternative, you can use <CODE>$dbh-&#62;{'mysql_insertid'}</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1597"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1598"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_blob</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a <CODE>BLOB</CODE>.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_blob};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1599"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1600"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the
respective column is a key.
Example:

<PRE>
$keys = $sth-&#62;{is_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1601"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1602"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_num</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the

respective column contains numeric values.
Example:

<PRE>
$nums = $sth-&#62;{is_num};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1603"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1604"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_pri_key</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of TRUE indicates that the respective column is a primary key.
Example:

<PRE>
$pri_keys = $sth-&#62;{is_pri_key};
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1605"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1606"></A>
<DT><CODE>is_not_null</CODE>
<DD>
Returns a reference to an array of boolean values; for each element of the
array, a value of FALSE indicates that this column may contain <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values.
Example:

<PRE>
$not_nulls = $sth-&#62;{is_not_null};
</PRE>

<CODE>is_not_null</CODE> is deprecated; it is preferable to use the
<CODE>NULLABLE</CODE> attribute (described above), because that is a DBI standard.

MySQL provides support for ODBC by means of the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>
program.  This chapter will teach you how to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>,
and how to use it.  Here, you will also find a list of common programs that
are known to work with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="Installing_MyODBC" HREF="manual_toc.html#Installing_MyODBC">8.3.1  How To Install MyODBC</A></H3>

<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 2.50 is a 32-bit ODBC 2.50 specification level 0 (with
level 1 and level 2 features) driver for connecting an ODBC-aware
application to MySQL.  <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> works on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
and most Unix platforms.
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> 3.51 is an enhanced version with ODBC 3.5x specification
level 1 (complete core API + level 2 features).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> is <CODE>Open Source</CODE>, and you can find the newest
version at <a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>.
Please note that the 2.50.x versions are <CODE>LGPL</CODE> licensed,
whereas the 3.51.x versions are <CODE>GPL</CODE> licensed.

</P>
<P>
If you have problem with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> and your program also works
with OLEDB, you should try the OLEDB driver.

</P>
<P>
Normally you only need to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on Windows machines.
You only need <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> for Unix if you have a program like
ColdFusion that is running on the Unix machine and uses ODBC to connect
to the databases.

</P>
<P>
If you want to install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on a Unix box, you will also need
an <CODE>ODBC</CODE> manager.  <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> is known to work with
most of the Unix ODBC managers.

</P>
<P>
To install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on Windows, you should download the
appropriate <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> <TT>`.zip'</TT> file,
unpack it with <CODE>WinZIP</CODE> or some similar program,
and execute the <TT>`SETUP.EXE'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
On Windows/NT/XP you may get the following error when trying to install
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
use ODBC)
</PRE>

<P>
The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing <CODE>Ignore</CODE> to copy the rest
of the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If
this doesn't work, the solution is to reboot your computer in ``safe
mode`` (Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts
Windows during rebooting), install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, and reboot to normal
mode.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To make a connection to a Unix box from a Windows box, with an ODBC
application (one that doesn't support MySQL natively), you must
first install <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> on the Windows machine.
<LI>

The user and Windows machine must have the access privileges to the
MySQL server on the Unix machine.  This is set up with the
<CODE>GRANT</CODE> command. See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

You must create an ODBC DSN entry as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

Open the Control Panel on the Windows machine.
<LI>

Double-click the ODBC Data Sources 32-bit icon.
<LI>

Click the tab User DSN.
<LI>

Click the button Add.
<LI>

Select MySQL in the screen Create New Data Source and click
the Finish button.
<LI>

The MySQL Driver default configuration screen is shown.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">8.3.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.
</UL>

<LI>

Now start your application and select the ODBC driver with the DSN you
specified in the ODBC administrator.
</UL>

<P>
Notice that there are other configuration options on the screen of
MySQL (trace, don't prompt on connect, etc) that you can try if
you run into problems.

</PRE>

For example:


<PRE>
194.216.84.21 my_hostname
</PRE>

<LI>

</PRE>

<P>
The value for the <CODE>Windows DSN name</CODE> field is any name that is unique
in your Windows ODBC setup.

</P>
<P>
You don't have to specify values for the <CODE>Server</CODE>, <CODE>User</CODE>,
<CODE>Password</CODE>, or <CODE>Port</CODE> fields in the ODBC setup screen.
However, if you do, the values will be used as the defaults later when
you attempt to make a connection.  You have the option of changing the
values at that time.

</P>
<P>
If the port number is not given, the default port (3306)
is used.

</P>
<P>
If you specify the option <CODE>Read options from C:\my.cnf</CODE>, the groups
<CODE>client</CODE> and <CODE>odbc</CODE> will be read from the <TT>`C:\my.cnf'</TT> file.
You can use all options that are usable by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1622"></A>

<DT>Access
<DD>
To make Access work:

<UL>
<LI>

If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the newest
(version 2.6 or above) Microsoft MDAC (<CODE>Microsoft Data Access
Components</CODE>) from <a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/data/">http://www.microsoft.com/data/</a>.  This will fix
the following bug in Access: when you export data to MySQL, the
table and column names aren't specified.  Another way to around this bug
is to upgrade to MyODBC Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version
3.23.x, which together provide a workaround for this bug!

You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5)
which can be found here
<a HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q 239/1/14.ASP</a>.
This will fix some cases where columns are marked as <CODE>#deleted#</CODE>
in Access.

Note that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to apply the
MDAC patch and use MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and above to go around
this problem.
<LI>

For all Access versions, you should enable the MyODBC option flag
<CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>. For Access 2.0, you should additionally enable
<CODE>Simulate ODBC 1.0</CODE>.
<LI>

You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able to update.
For maximum portability <CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE> or simple <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
is recommended instead of other <CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> variations.
<LI>

You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or updated rows
may show up as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE>.
<LI>

Only use <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> float fields. Access fails when comparing with
single floats.  The symptom usually is that new or updated rows may show
up as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE> or that you can't find or update rows.
<LI>

If you are linking a table through MyODBC, which has <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> as
one of the column, then the results will be displayed as <CODE>#DELETED</CODE>. The
work around solution is:

<UL>
<LI>

Have one more dummy column with <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> as the data type, preferably
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(14)</CODE>.
<LI>

Check the <CODE>'Change BIGINT columns to INT'</CODE> in connection options dialog in
ODBC DSN Administrator
<LI>

Delete the table link from access and re-create it.
</UL>

It still displays the previous records as <CODE>#DELETED#</CODE>, but newly
added/updated records will be displayed properly.
<LI>

If you still get the error <CODE>Another user has changed your data</CODE> after
adding a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column, the following trick may help you:

Don't use <CODE>table</CODE> data sheet view. Create instead a form with the
fields you want, and use that <CODE>form</CODE> data sheet view.  You should
set the <CODE>DefaultValue</CODE> property for the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column to
<CODE>NOW()</CODE>.  It may be a good idea to hide the <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column
from view so your users are not confused.
<LI>

In some cases, Access may generate illegal SQL queries that
MySQL can't understand. You can fix this by selecting
<CODE>"Query|SQLSpecific|Pass-Through"</CODE> from the Access menu.
<LI>

Access on NT will report <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns as <CODE>OLE OBJECTS</CODE>. If
you want to have <CODE>MEMO</CODE> columns instead, you should change the
column to <CODE>TEXT</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<LI>

Access can't always handle <CODE>DATE</CODE> columns properly. If you have a problem
with these, change the columns to <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>.
<LI>

If you have in Access a column defined as <CODE>BYTE</CODE>, Access will try
to export this as <CODE>TINYINT</CODE> instead of <CODE>TINYINT UNSIGNED</CODE>.
This will give you problems if you have values &#62; 127 in the column!
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1623"></A>
<DT>ADO
<DD>
When you are coding with the ADO API and <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> you need to put
attention in some default properties that aren't supported by the
MySQL server.  For example, using the <CODE>CursorLocation
Property</CODE> as <CODE>adUseServer</CODE> will return for the <CODE>RecordCount
Property</CODE> a result of -1. To have the right value, you need to set this
property to <CODE>adUseClient</CODE>, like is showing in the VB code here:


<PRE>
Dim myconn As New ADODB.Connection
Dim myrs As New Recordset
Dim mySQL As String
Dim myrows As Long

myconn.Open "DSN=MyODBCsample"
mySQL = "SELECT * from user"
myrs.Source = mySQL
Set myrs.ActiveConnection = myconn
myrs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
myrs.Open
myrows = myrs.RecordCount

myrs.Close
myconn.Close
</PRE>

Another workaround is to use a <CODE>SELECT COUNT(*)</CODE> statement
for a similar query to get the correct row count.

<DT>Active server pages (ASP)
<DD>
You should use the option flag <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<DT>BDE applications
<DD>
To get these to work, you should set the option flags
<CODE>Don't optimize column widths</CODE> and <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1624"></A>
<DT>Borland Builder 4
<DD>
When you start a query you can use the property <CODE>Active</CODE> or use the
method <CODE>Open</CODE>.  Note that <CODE>Active</CODE> will start by automatically
issuing a <CODE>SELECT * FROM ...</CODE> query that may not be a good thing if
your tables are big!
<DT>ColdFusion (On Unix)
<DD>
The following information is taken from the ColdFusion documentation:

Use the following information to configure ColdFusion Server for Linux
to use the unixODBC driver with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> for MySQL data
sources.  Allaire has verified that <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> Version 2.50.26
works with MySQL Version 3.22.27 and ColdFusion for Linux. (Any
newer version should also work.) You can download <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html</a>

<A NAME="IDX1625"></A>
ColdFusion Version 4.5.1 allows you to us the ColdFusion Administrator
to add the MySQL data source. However, the driver is not
included with ColdFusion Version 4.5.1. Before the MySQL driver
will appear in the ODBC datasources drop-down list, you must build and
copy the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver to
<TT>`/opt/coldfusion/lib/libmyodbc.so'</TT>.

The Contrib directory contains the program <TT>`mydsn-xxx.zip'</TT> which allows
you to build and remove the DSN registry file for the MyODBC driver
on Coldfusion applications.

<A NAME="IDX1626"></A>
<DT>DataJunction
<DD>
You have to change it to output <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, as
it exports the latter in a manner that causes MySQL grief.
<A NAME="IDX1627"></A>
<DT>Excel
<DD>
Works. A few tips:

<UL>
<LI>

If you have problems with dates, try to select them as strings using the
<CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> function. For example:

<PRE>
select CONCAT(rise_time), CONCAT(set_time)
    from sunrise_sunset;
</PRE>

Values retrieved as strings this way should be correctly recognised
as time values by Excel97.

The purpose of <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> in this example is to fool ODBC into thinking
the column is of ``string type''. Without the <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>, ODBC knows the
column is of time type, and Excel does not understand that.

Note that this is a bug in Excel, because it automatically converts a
string to a time. This would be great if the source was a text file, but
is plain stupid when the source is an ODBC connection that reports
exact types for each column.
</UL>

<A NAME="IDX1628"></A>
<DT>Word
<DD>
To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
use the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:


<UL>
<LI>

Insert rows using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client command-line tool.
<LI>

Create a DSN file using the ODBC manager, for example, <TT>`my'</TT> for the db above.
<LI>

Open the Word application.
<LI>

Create a blank new documentation.
<LI>

Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert database.
<LI>

Press the button Get Data.
<LI>

At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms Query.
<LI>

In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file my.
<LI>

Select the new query.
<LI>

Select the columns that you want.
<LI>

Make a filter if you want.
<LI>

Make a Sort if you want.
<LI>

Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.
<LI>

Click Finish.
<LI>

Click Insert data and select the records.
<LI>

Click OK and you see the rows in your Word document.

Tested with BDE Version 3.0. The only known problem is that when the table
schema changes, query fields are not updated. BDE, however, does not seem
to recognise primary keys, only the index PRIMARY, though this has not
been a problem.

You should use the option flag <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE>.

<DT>Visual Basic
<DD>
To be able to update a table, you must define a primary key for the table.

Visual Basic with ADO can't handle big integers. This means that some queries
like <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> will not work properly.  The fix is to set
the option <CODE>OPTION=16384</CODE> in the ODBC connect string or to set
the <CODE>Change BIGINT columns to INT</CODE> option in the MyODBC connect screen.
You may also want to set the <CODE>Return matching rows</CODE> option.

<DT>VisualInterDev
<DD>
If you get the error <CODE>[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver does
not support this parameter</CODE> the reason may be that you have a
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> in your result.  Try setting the <CODE>Change BIGINT
columns to INT</CODE> option in the MyODBC connect screen.

<DT>Visual Objects
<DD>
You should use the option flag <CODE>Don't optimize column widths</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="ODBC_and_last_insert_id" HREF="manual_toc.html#ODBC_and_last_insert_id">8.3.6  How to Get the Value of an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> Column in ODBC</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1633"></A>

</P>
<P>
A common problem is how to get the value of an automatically generated ID
from an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>. With ODBC, you can do something like this (assuming
that <CODE>auto</CODE> is an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field):

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
</PRE>

<P>
Or, if you are just going to insert the ID into another table, you can do this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text) VALUES(NULL,'text');
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text) VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Getting_unique_ID">8.4.6.3  How Can I Get the Unique ID for the Last Inserted Row?</A>.

</P>
<P>
For the benefit of some ODBC applications (at least Delphi and Access),
the following query can be used to find a newly inserted row:

<PRE>
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE auto IS NULL;
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1636"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you encounter difficulties with <CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, you should start by
making a log file from the ODBC manager (the log you get when requesting
logs from ODBCADMIN) and a <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> log.

</P>
<P>
To get a <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> log, you need to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Ensure that you are using <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT> and not <TT>`myodbc.dll'</TT>.
The easiest way to do this is to get <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT> from the MyODBC
distribution and copy it over the <TT>`myodbc.dll'</TT>, which is probably
in your <TT>`C:\windows\system32'</TT> or <TT>`C:\winnt\system32'</TT> directory.

Note that you probably want to restore the old myodbc.dll file when you
have finished testing, as this is a lot faster than <TT>`myodbcd.dll'</TT>.
<LI>

Tag the `Trace MyODBC' option flag in the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> connect/configure
screen.  The log will be written to file <TT>`C:\myodbc.log'</TT>.

If the trace option is not remembered when you are going back to the
above screen, it means that you are not using the <CODE>myodbcd.dll</CODE>
driver (see the item above).
<LI>

Start your application and try to get it to fail.
</OL>

<P>
Check the <CODE>MyODBC trace file</CODE>, to find out what could be wrong.
You should be able to find out the issued queries by searching after
the string <CODE>&#62;mysql_real_query</CODE> in the <TT>`myodbc.log'</TT> file.

</P>
<P>
You should also try duplicating the queries in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> monitor
or <CODE>admndemo</CODE> to find out if the error is MyODBC or MySQL.

</P>
<P>
If you find out something is wrong, please only send the relevant rows
(max 40 rows) to <a HREF="mailto:myodbc@lists.mysql.com">myodbc@lists.mysql.com</a>.  Please never
send the whole MyODBC or ODBC log file!

</P>
<P>
If you are unable to find out what's wrong, the last option is to
make an archive (tar or zip) that contains a MyODBC trace file, the ODBC
log file, and a README file that explains the problem.  You can send this
to <a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a>.  Only we at
MySQL AB will have access to the files you upload, and we will
be very discrete with the data!

</P>
<P>
If you can create a program that also shows this problem, please
upload this too!

</P>
<P>
If the program works with some other SQL server, you should make an ODBC log
file where you do exactly the same thing in the other SQL server.

</P>
<P>
Remember that the more information you can supply to us, the more
likely it is that we can fix the problem!

</P>



<H2><A NAME="C" HREF="manual_toc.html#C">8.4  MySQL C API</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1637"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1638"></A>

</P>

<P>
The C API code is distributed with MySQL. It is included in the
<CODE>mysqlclient</CODE> library and allows C programs to access a database.

</P>
<P>
Many of the clients in the MySQL source distribution are
written in C.  If you are looking for examples that demonstrate how to
use the C API, take a look at these clients. You can find these in the
<CODE>clients</CODE> directory in the MySQL source distribution.

</P>
<P>
Most of the other client APIs (all except Java) use the <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>
library to communicate with the MySQL server. This means that, for
example, you can take advantage of many of the same environment variables
that are used by other client programs, because they are referenced from the
library.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Client-Side_Scripts">4.8  MySQL Client-Side Scripts and Utilities</A>, for a list of these variables.

</P>
<P>
The client has a maximum communication buffer size. The size of the buffer
that is allocated initially (16K bytes) is automatically increased up to the
maximum size (the maximum is 16M). Because buffer sizes are increased
only as demand warrants, simply increasing the default maximum limit does not
in itself cause more resources to be used. This size check is mostly a check
for erroneous queries and communication packets.

</P>
<P>
The communication buffer must be large enough to contain a single SQL
statement (for client-to-server traffic) and one row of returned data (for
server-to-client traffic).  Each thread's communication buffer is dynamically
enlarged to handle any query or row up to the maximum limit.  For example, if
you have <CODE>BLOB</CODE> values that contain up to 16M of data, you must have a
communication buffer limit of at least 16M (in both server and client).  The
client's default maximum is 16M, but the default maximum in the server is
1M.  You can increase this by changing the value of the
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> parameter when the server is started.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Server_parameters">5.5.2  Tuning Server Parameters</A>.

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server shrinks each communication buffer to
<CODE>net_buffer_length</CODE> bytes after each query.  For clients, the size of
the buffer associated with a connection is not decreased until the connection
is closed, at which time client memory is reclaimed.

</P>
<P>
For programming with threads, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Threaded_clients">8.4.8  How to Make a Threaded Client</A>.
For creating a stand-alone application which includes the
"server" and "client" in the same program (and does not
communicate with an external MySQL server), see section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">8.4.9  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.

<DT><CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1639"></A>
 
This structure represents a handle to one database connection. It is
used for almost all MySQL functions.

<A NAME="IDX1640"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE>
<DD>
This structure represents the result of a query that returns rows
(<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).  The
information returned from a query is called the <EM>result set</EM> in the
remainder of this section.

<A NAME="IDX1641"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of one row of data. It is currently
implemented as an array of counted byte strings.  (You cannot treat these as
null-terminated strings if field values may contain binary data, because such
values may contain null bytes internally.)  Rows are obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1642"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE>
<DD>
This structure contains information about a field, such as the field's
name, type, and size. Its members are described in more detail here.
You may obtain the <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structures for each field by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly.  Field values are not part of
this structure; they are contained in a <CODE>MYSQL_ROW</CODE> structure.

<A NAME="IDX1643"></A>
<DT><CODE>MYSQL_FIELD_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
This is a type-safe representation of an offset into a MySQL field
list.  (Used by <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.)  Offsets are field numbers
within a row, beginning at zero.

<A NAME="IDX1644"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1645"></A>
<DT><CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
<DD>
The type used for the number of rows and for <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>, and <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE>. This type provides a
range of <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>1.84e19</CODE>.

On some systems, attempting to print a value of type <CODE>my_ulonglong</CODE>
will not work.  To print such a value, convert it to <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>
and use a <CODE>%lu</CODE> print format.  Example:

<PRE>
printf (Number of rows: %lu\n", (unsigned long) mysql_num_rows(result));
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The <CODE>MYSQL_FIELD</CODE> structure contains the members listed here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>char * name</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the field, as a null-terminated string.

<DT><CODE>char * table</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the table containing this field, if it isn't a calculated field.
For calculated fields, the <CODE>table</CODE> value is an empty string.

<DT><CODE>char * def</CODE>
<DD>
The default value of this field, as a null-terminated string.  This is set
only if you use <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>enum enum_field_types type</CODE>

</TABLE>

You can use the <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> macro to test whether a field has a
numeric type.  Pass the <CODE>type</CODE> value to <CODE>IS_NUM()</CODE> and it
will evaluate to TRUE if the field is numeric:


<PRE>
if (IS_NUM(field-&#62;type))
    printf("Field is numeric\n");
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int length</CODE>
<DD>
The width of the field, as specified in the table definition.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum width of the field for the result set (the length of the longest
field value for the rows actually in the result set). If you use
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_list_fields()</CODE>, this contains the
maximum length for the field.  If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, the
value of this variable is zero.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int flags</CODE>
<DD>
Different bit-flags for the field.  The <CODE>flags</CODE> value may have zero
or more of the following bits set:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">

<TR><TD><CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE> </TD><TD> Field is a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> (deprecated)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Use of the <CODE>BLOB_FLAG</CODE>, <CODE>ENUM_FLAG</CODE>, <CODE>SET_FLAG</CODE>, and
<CODE>TIMESTAMP_FLAG</CODE> flags is deprecated because they indicate the type of
a field rather than an attribute of its type.  It is preferable to test
<CODE>field-&#62;type</CODE> against <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_ENUM</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_SET</CODE>, or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP</CODE> instead.

The following example illustrates a typical use of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:


<PRE>
if (field-&#62;flags &#38; NOT_NULL_FLAG)
    printf("Field can't be null\n");
</PRE>

You may use the following convenience macros to determine the boolean
status of the <CODE>flags</CODE> value:

<P>
To connect to the server, call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialise a
connection handler, then call <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> with that
handler (along with other information such as the hostname, user name,
and password).  Upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the
<CODE>reconnect</CODE> flag (part of the MYSQL structure) to a value of
<CODE>1</CODE>. This flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be
performed because of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the
server before giving up.  When you are done with the connection, call
<CODE>mysql_close()</CODE> to terminate it.

</P>
<P>
While a connection is active, the client may send SQL queries to the server
using <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.  The difference
between the two is that <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> expects the query to be
specified as a null-terminated string whereas <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>
expects a counted string.  If the string contains binary data (which may
include null bytes), you must use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For each non-<CODE>SELECT</CODE> query (for example, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>), you can find out how many rows were changed (affected)
by calling <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, you retrieve the selected rows as a result set.
(Note that some statements are <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like in that they return rows.
These include <CODE>SHOW</CODE>, <CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, and <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.  They should
be treated the same way as <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.)

</P>
<P>
There are two ways for a client to process result sets.  One way is to
retrieve the entire result set all at once by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.  This function acquires from the server all the
rows returned by the query and stores them in the client.  The second way is
for the client to initiate a row-by-row result set retrieval by calling
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>.  This function initialises the retrieval, but does
not actually get any rows from the server.

</P>
<P>
In both cases, you access rows by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> accesses rows that have
already been fetched from the server.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> actually retrieves the row from the server.
Information about the size of the data in each row is available by
calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After you are done with a result set, call <CODE>mysql_free_result()</CODE>
to free the memory used for it.

</P>
<P>
The two retrieval mechanisms are complementary.  Client programs should
choose the approach that is most appropriate for their requirements.
In practice, clients tend to use <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> more
commonly.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is that because the rows have all
been fetched to the client, you not only can access rows sequentially, you
can move back and forth in the result set using <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE> to change the current row position within the result
set.  You can also find out how many rows there are by calling
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.  On the other hand, the memory requirements for
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> may be very high for large result sets and you
are more likely to encounter out-of-memory conditions.

</P>
<P>
An advantage of <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> is that the client requires less
memory for the result set because it maintains only one row at a time (and
because there is less allocation overhead, <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> can be
faster).  Disadvantages are that you must process each row quickly to avoid
tying up the server, you don't have random access to rows within the result
set (you can only access rows sequentially), and you don't know how many rows
are in the result set until you have retrieved them all.  Furthermore, you
<STRONG>must</STRONG> retrieve all the rows even if you determine in mid-retrieval that
you've found the information you were looking for.

</P>
<P>
The API makes it possible for clients to respond appropriately to
queries (retrieving rows only as necessary) without knowing whether or
not the query is a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.  You can do this by calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> after each <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> (or
<CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE>).  If the result set call succeeds, the query
was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> and you can read the rows.  If the result set call
fails, call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether a
result was actually to be expected.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>
returns zero, the query returned no data (indicating that it was an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, etc.), and was not
expected to return rows.  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> is non-zero, the
query should have returned rows, but didn't.  This indicates that the
query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> that failed.  See the description for
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> for an example of how this can be done.

</P>
<P>
Both <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> allow you to
obtain information about the fields that make up the result set (the number
of fields, their names and types, etc.).  You can access field information
sequentially within the row by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> repeatedly,
or by field number within the row by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_field_direct()</CODE>.  The current field cursor position may be
changed by calling <CODE>mysql_field_seek()</CODE>.  Setting the field cursor
affects subsequent calls to <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE>.  You can also get
information for fields all at once by calling <CODE>mysql_fetch_fields()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
For detecting and reporting errors, MySQL provides access to error
information by means of the <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
functions.  These return the error code or error message for the most
recently invoked function that can succeed or fail, allowing you to determine
when an error occurred and what it was.

<H3><A NAME="C_API_functions" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_API_functions">8.4.3  C API Function Descriptions</A></H3>

<P>
In the descriptions here, a parameter or return value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> means
<CODE>NULL</CODE> in the sense of the C programming language, not a
MySQL <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.

</P>
<P>
Functions that return a value generally return a pointer or an integer.
Unless specified otherwise, functions returning a pointer return a
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate success or a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value to indicate
an error, and functions returning an integer return zero to indicate success
or non-zero to indicate an error.  Note that ``non-zero'' means just that.
Unless the function description says otherwise, do not test against a value
other than zero:

</P>

<PRE>
if (result)                   /* correct */
    ... error ...

if (result &#60; 0)               /* incorrect */
    ... error ...

if (result == -1)             /* incorrect */
    ... error ...
</PRE>

<P>
When a function returns an error, the <STRONG>Errors</STRONG> subsection of the
function description lists the possible types of errors.  You can
find out which of these occurred by calling <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.
A string representation of the error may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.

<H4>8.4.3.2  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of rows changed by the last <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, deleted by
the last <CODE>DELETE</CODE> or inserted by the last <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statement. May be called immediately after <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> for
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements.  For

<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.3  Return Values</H4>

<P>
An integer greater than zero indicates the number of rows affected or
retrieved.  Zero indicates that no records where updated for an
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statement, no rows matched the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause in the
query or that no query has yet been executed.  -1 indicates that the
query returned an error or that, for a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> query,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> was called prior to calling
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.

<P>
If one specifies the flag <CODE>CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> when connecting to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return the number of
rows matched by the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement for <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements.

</P>
<P>
Note that when one uses a <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> command,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> will return 2 if the new row replaced and
old row.  This is because in this case one row was inserted after the
duplicate was deleted.

<P>
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL

allocates memory for the connection structure automatically and frees it
when you call <CODE>mysql_close()</CODE>. The disadvantage of this approach is
that you can't retrieve an error message if the connection fails.  (To

<CODE>my_bool mysql_eof(MYSQL_RES *result)</CODE>

<H4>8.4.3.47  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is deprecated.  <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>
may be used instead.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> determines whether the last row of a result
set has been read.

</P>
<P>
If you acquire a result set from a successful call to
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, the client receives the entire set in one
operation.  In this case, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return from
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> always means the end of the result set has been
reached and it is unnecessary to call <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>.  When used
with <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> will always return
true.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> to initiate a result
set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by one as
you call <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> repeatedly.  Because an error may occur on
the connection during this process, a <CODE>NULL</CODE> return value from
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> does not necessarily mean the end of the result set
was reached normally.  In this case, you can use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> to
determine what happened.  <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns a non-zero value if the
end of the result set was reached and zero if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
Historically, <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> predates the standard MySQL error
functions <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE>.  Because those error
functions provide the same information, their use is preferred over
<CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>, which is now deprecated.  (In fact, they provide more
information, because <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE> returns only a boolean value whereas
the error functions indicate a reason for the error when one occurs.)

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.48  Return Values</H4>

Zero if no error occurred. Non-zero if the end of the result set has been
reached.

<H4>8.4.3.49  Errors</H4>
<P>
None.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.50  Example</H4>

<P>
The following example shows how you might use <CODE>mysql_eof()</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))

{
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", mysql_error(&#38;mysql));
}
</PRE>

<P>
However, you can achieve the same effect with the standard MySQL
error functions:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql_query(&#38;mysql,"SELECT * FROM some_table");
result = mysql_use_result(&#38;mysql);
while((row = mysql_fetch_row(result)))

<H4>8.4.3.56  Description</H4>

<P>
For the connection specified by <CODE>mysql</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> returns
the error message for the most recently invoked API function that can succeed
or fail.  An empty string (<CODE>""</CODE>) is returned if no error occurred.
This means the following two tests are equivalent:

</P>
<P>
If you've called <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> to perform a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> on a table

default blob length (8K bytes) if you call <CODE>mysql_fetch_field()</CODE> to ask
for the length of a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> field.  (The 8K size is chosen because
MySQL doesn't know the maximum length for the <CODE>BLOB</CODE>. This
should be made configurable sometime.) Once you've retrieved the result set,
<CODE>field-&#62;max_length</CODE> contains the length of the largest value for this

<H4>8.4.3.76  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the lengths of the columns of the current row within a result set.
If you plan to copy field values, this length information is also useful for
optimisation, because you can avoid calling <CODE>strlen()</CODE>.  In addition, if
the result set contains binary data, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> use this function to
determine the size of the data, because <CODE>strlen()</CODE> returns incorrect
results for any field containing null characters.

The length for empty columns and for columns containing <CODE>NULL</CODE> values is
zero.  To see how to distinguish these two cases, see the description for

<H4>8.4.3.81  Description</H4>

<P>
Retrieves the next row of a result set. When used after
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE>
when there are no more rows to retrieve.  When used after
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> when
there are no more rows to retrieve or if an error occurred.

</P>
<P>
The number of values in the row is given by <CODE>mysql_num_fields(result)</CODE>.
If <CODE>row</CODE> holds the return value from a call to <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>,
pointers to the values are accessed as <CODE>row[0]</CODE> to

indicated by <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointers.

</P>
<P>
The lengths of the field values in the row may be obtained by calling
<CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE>.  Empty fields and fields containing
<CODE>NULL</CODE> both have length 0; you can distinguish these by checking
the pointer for the field value.  If the pointer is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the field
is <CODE>NULL</CODE>; otherwise, the field is empty.

<H4>8.4.3.86  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the number of columns for the most recent query on the connection.

</P>
<P>
The normal use of this function is when <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
returned <CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).
In this case, you can call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to
determine whether <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a
non-empty result.  This allows the client program to take proper action
without knowing whether the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The example shown here illustrates how this
may be done.

<P>
Allocates or initialises a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> object suitable for
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.  If <CODE>mysql</CODE> is a <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer, the
function allocates, initialises, and returns a new object.  Otherwise, the
object is initialised and the address of the object is returned.  If
<CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> allocates a new object, it will be freed when
<CODE>mysql_close()</CODE> is called to close the connection.

<H4>8.4.3.131  Description</H4>

<P>
Returns the ID generated for an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column by the previous
query.  Use this function after you have performed an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> query
into a table that contains an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> field.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns <CODE>0</CODE> if the previous query
does not generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value.  If you need to save
the value for later, be sure to call <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> immediately
after the query that generates the value.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> is updated after <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> statements that generate an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value or
that set a column value to <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID(expr)</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
Also note that the value of the SQL <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function always
contains the most recently generated <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> value, and is
not reset between queries because the value of that function is maintained
in the server.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.132  Return Values</H4>

<P>
The second form doesn't work on MySQL Version 3.22.24 or newer.  To pass a

<P>
Returns the number of columns in a result set.

</P>
<P>
Note that you can get the number of columns either from a pointer to a result
set or to a connection handle.  You would use the connection handle if
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> returned
<CODE>NULL</CODE> (and thus you have no result set pointer).  In this case, you can
call <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> to determine whether
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> should have produced a non-empty result.  This
allows the client program to take proper action without knowing whether or
not the query was a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> (or <CODE>SELECT</CODE>-like) statement.  The
example shown here illustrates how this may be done.

                 const char *user, const char *passwd, const char *db,

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.176  Description</H4>

<P>
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> attempts to establish a connection to a
MySQL database engine running on <CODE>host</CODE>.
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> must complete successfully before you can execute
any of the other API functions, with the exception of
<CODE>mysql_get_client_info()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The parameters are specified as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The first parameter should be the address of an existing <CODE>MYSQL</CODE>
structure.  Before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> you must call
<CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> to initialise the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure. You can
change a lot of connect options with the <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>
call.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_options">8.4.3.163  <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>host</CODE> may be either a hostname or an IP address.  If
<CODE>host</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE> or the string <CODE>"localhost"</CODE>, a connection to
the local host is assumed. If the OS supports sockets (Unix) or named pipes
(Windows), they are used instead of TCP/IP to connect to the server.

<LI>

The <CODE>user</CODE> parameter contains the user's MySQL login ID.  If
<CODE>user</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the current user is assumed.  Under Unix, this is
the current login name.  Under Windows ODBC, the current user name must be
specified explicitly.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#ODBC_administrator">8.3.2  How to Fill in the Various Fields in the ODBC Administrator Program</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>passwd</CODE> parameter contains the password for <CODE>user</CODE>.  If
<CODE>passwd</CODE> is <CODE>NULL</CODE>, only entries in the <CODE>user</CODE> table for the
user that have a blank (empty) password field will be checked for a match. This
allows the database administrator to set up the MySQL privilege
system in such a way that users get different privileges depending on whether
or not they have specified a password.

Note: Do not attempt to encrypt the password before calling
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>; password encryption is handled automatically by
the client API.

<LI>

<CODE>db</CODE> is the database name.
If <CODE>db</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the connection will set the default
database to this value.

<LI>

If <CODE>port</CODE> is not 0, the value will be used as the port number
for the TCP/IP connection.  Note that the <CODE>host</CODE> parameter
determines the type of the connection.

<LI>

If <CODE>unix_socket</CODE> is not <CODE>NULL</CODE>, the string specifies the
socket or named pipe that should be used.  Note that the <CODE>host</CODE>
parameter determines the type of the connection.

<LI>

The value of <CODE>client_flag</CODE> is usually 0, but can be set to a combination
of the following flags in very special circumstances:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Flag description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_COMPRESS</CODE> </TD><TD> Use compression protocol.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> </TD><TD> Return the number of found (matched) rows, not the number of affected rows.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> </TD><TD> Allow spaces after function names. Makes all functions names reserved words.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_INTERACTIVE</CODE> </TD><TD> Allow <CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE> seconds (instead of <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> seconds) of inactivity before closing the connection.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA</CODE> </TD><TD> Don't allow the <CODE>db_name.tbl_name.col_name</CODE> syntax.  This is for ODBC. It causes the parser to generate an error if you use that syntax, which is useful for trapping bugs in some ODBC programs.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CLIENT_ODBC</CODE> </TD><TD> The client is an ODBC client. This changes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be more ODBC-friendly.

<PRE>
MYSQL mysql;

mysql_init(&#38;mysql);
mysql_options(&#38;mysql,MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,"your_prog_name");
if (!mysql_real_connect(&#38;mysql,"host","user","passwd","database",0,NULL,0))

<P>
By using <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the MySQL library will read the
<CODE>[client]</CODE> and <CODE>[your_prog_name]</CODE> sections in the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>
file which will ensure that your program will work, even if someone has
set up MySQL in some non-standard way.

</P>
<P>
Note that upon connection, <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> sets the <CODE>reconnect</CODE>
flag (part of the <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> structure) to a value of <CODE>1</CODE>. This
flag indicates, in the event that a query cannot be performed because
of a lost connection, to try reconnecting to the server before giving up.

<P>
<CODE>unsigned long mysql_real_escape_string(MYSQL *mysql, char *to, const char *from, unsigned long length)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.181  Description</H4>

<P>
This function is used to create a legal SQL string that you can use in a
SQL statement. See section <A HREF="manual.html#String_syntax">6.1.1.1  Strings</A>.

</P>
<P>
The string in <CODE>from</CODE> is encoded to an escaped SQL string, taking
into account the current character set of the connection. The result is placed
in <CODE>to</CODE> and a terminating null byte is appended.  Characters
encoded are <CODE>NUL</CODE> (ASCII 0), <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\r'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`''</SAMP>, <SAMP>`"'</SAMP>, and Control-Z (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Literals">6.1.1  Literals: How to Write Strings and Numbers</A>).
(Strictly speaking, MySQL requires only that backslash and the quote
character used to quote the string in the query be escaped.  This function
quotes the other characters to make them easier to read in log files.)

</P>
<P>
The string pointed to by <CODE>from</CODE> must be <CODE>length</CODE> bytes long.  You
must allocate the <CODE>to</CODE> buffer to be at least <CODE>length*2+1</CODE> bytes
long.  (In the worst case, each character may need to be encoded as using two
bytes, and you need room for the terminating null byte.)  When
<CODE>mysql_real_escape_string()</CODE> returns, the contents of <CODE>to</CODE> will be a
null-terminated string.  The return value is the length of the encoded
string, not including the terminating null character.

</P>

Executes the SQL query pointed to by <CODE>query</CODE>, which should be a string
<CODE>length</CODE> bytes long.  The query must consist of a single SQL statement.
You should not add a terminating semicolon (<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>) or <CODE>\g</CODE> to the

</P>
<P>
You <STRONG>must</STRONG> use <CODE>mysql_real_query()</CODE> rather than
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> for queries that contain binary data, because binary data

is faster than <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> because it does not call <CODE>strlen()</CODE> on
the query string.

</P>
<P>

in all cases.  You can detect if the query didn't have a result set by
checking if <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> returns 0 (more about this later one).

<CODE>MYSQL_RES *mysql_use_result(MYSQL *mysql)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.222  Description</H4>

<P>
You must call <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> for
every query that successfully retrieves data (<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>,
<CODE>DESCRIBE</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> initiates a result set retrieval but does not
actually read the result set into the client like <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>
does.  Instead, each row must be retrieved individually by making calls to
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.  This reads the result of a query directly from the
server without storing it in a temporary table or local buffer, which is
somewhat faster and uses much less memory than <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
The client will only allocate memory for the current row and a communication
buffer that may grow up to <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you shouldn't use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> if you are
doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side, or if the output
is sent to a screen on which the user may type a <CODE>^S</CODE> (stop scroll).
This will tie up the server and prevent other threads from updating any
tables from which the data is being fetched.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, you must execute
<CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE> until a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is returned, otherwise, the
unfetched rows will be returned as part of the result set for your next
query. The C API will give the error <CODE>Commands out of sync; you can't
run this command now</CODE> if you forget to do this!

</P>
<P>
You may not use <CODE>mysql_data_seek()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_row_seek()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_row_tell()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE>, or
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> with a result returned from
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>, nor may you issue other queries until the
<CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> has finished.  (However, after you have fetched all
the rows, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> will accurately return the number of rows
fetched.)

</P>
<P>
You must call <CODE>mysql_free_result()</CODE> once you are done with the result
set.

</P>

<H4>8.4.3.223  Return Values</H4>

<P>
A <CODE>MYSQL_RES</CODE> result structure. <CODE>NULL</CODE> if an error occurred.

<P>
This function needs to be called once in the program before calling any
MySQL function.  This initialises some global variables that MySQL
needs.  If you are using a thread-safe client library, this will also
call <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> for this thread.

</P>
<P>
Note that this function <STRONG>is not invoked automatically</STRONG> by the client

<H3><A NAME="C_Embedded_Server_func" HREF="manual_toc.html#C_Embedded_Server_func">8.4.5  C Embedded Server Function Descriptions</A></H3>

<P>
You must use the following functions if you want to allow your
application to be linked against the embedded MySQL server library.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">8.4.9  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the program is linked with <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE> instead of
<CODE>-lmysqld</CODE>, these functions do nothing.  This makes it
possible to choose between using the embedded MySQL server and
a stand-alone server without modifying any code.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>int mysql_server_init(int argc, char **argv, char **groups)</CODE>

</P>

<H4>8.4.5.2  Description</H4>

<P>
This function <STRONG>must</STRONG> be called once in the program using the
embedded server before calling any other MySQL function.  It starts up
the server and initialises any subsystems (<CODE>mysys</CODE>, InnoDB, etc.) 
that the server uses.  If this function is not called, the program will
crash.  If you are using the DBUG package that comes with MySQL, you
should call this after you have called <CODE>MY_INIT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>argc</CODE> and <CODE>argv</CODE> arguments are analogous to the arguments
to <CODE>main()</CODE>.  The first element of <CODE>argv</CODE> is ignored (it
typically contains the program name).  For convenience, <CODE>argc</CODE> may
be <CODE>0</CODE> (zero) if there are no command-line arguments for the
server.  <CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> makes a copy of the arguments so
it's safe to destroy <CODE>argv</CODE> or <CODE>groups</CODE> after the call.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>NULL</CODE>-terminated list of strings in <CODE>groups</CODE>
selects which groups in the option files will be active.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  For convenience, <CODE>groups</CODE> may be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>, in which case the <CODE>[server]</CODE> and <CODE>[emedded]</CODE> groups
will be active.

<P>
It is possible for <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>
following a successful call to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.  When this happens, it
means one of the following conditions occurred:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

There was a <CODE>malloc()</CODE> failure (for example, if the result set was too
large).

<LI>

The data couldn't be read (an error occurred on the connection).

<LI>

The query returned no data (for example, it was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>,
<CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).
</UL>

<P>
You can always check whether the statement should have produced a
non-empty result by calling <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE>.  If
<CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns zero, the result is empty and the last
query was a statement that does not return values (for example, an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> or a <CODE>DELETE</CODE>).  If <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> returns a
non-zero value, the statement should have produced a non-empty result.
See the description of the <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> function for an
example.

</P>
<P>
You can test for an error by calling <CODE>mysql_error()</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="Query_results" HREF="manual_toc.html#Query_results">8.4.6.2  What Results Can I Get From a Query?</A></H4>

<P>
In addition to the result set returned by a query, you can also get the
following information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows affected by the last
query when doing an <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>, or <CODE>DELETE</CODE>. An
exception is that if <CODE>DELETE</CODE> is used without a <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause, the
table is re-created empty, which is much faster! In this case,
<CODE>mysql_affected_rows()</CODE> returns zero for the number of records
affected.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> returns the number of rows in a result set.  With
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>, <CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called as soon as
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> returns.  With <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>,
<CODE>mysql_num_rows()</CODE> may be called only after you have fetched all the
rows with <CODE>mysql_fetch_row()</CODE>.

<LI>

<CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> returns the ID generated by the last
query that inserted a row into a table with an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql_insert_id">8.4.3.130  <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE></A>.

<LI>

Some queries (<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE ...</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT INTO
... SELECT ...</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>) return additional information.  The result is
returned by <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>.  See the description for <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE>
for the format of the string that it returns.  <CODE>mysql_info()</CODE> returns a
<CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer if there is no additional information.

</P>
<P>
If you insert a record in a table containing a column that has the
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> attribute, you can get the most recently generated
ID by calling the <CODE>mysql_insert_id()</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
You can also retrieve the ID by using the <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE> function in
a query string that you pass to <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check if an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index is used by executing
the following code. This also checks if the query was an <CODE>INSERT</CODE> with
an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> index:

</P>

<PRE>
if (mysql_error(&#38;mysql)[0] == 0 &#38;&
    mysql_num_fields(result) == 0 &#38;&
    mysql_insert_id(&#38;mysql) != 0)
{
    used_id = mysql_insert_id(&#38;mysql);
}
</PRE>

<P>
The most recently generated ID is maintained in the server on a
per-connection basis.  It will not be changed by another client. It will not
even be changed if you update another <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column with a
non-magic value (that is, a value that is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> and not <CODE>0</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
If you want to use the ID that was generated for one table and insert
it into a second table, you can use SQL statements like this:

</P>

<PRE>
INSERT INTO foo (auto,text)
    VALUES(NULL,'text');              # generate ID by inserting NULL
INSERT INTO foo2 (id,text)
    VALUES(LAST_INSERT_ID(),'text');  # use ID in second table

<P>
If you compile MySQL clients that you've written yourself or that
you obtain from a third-party, they must be linked using the
<CODE>-lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> option on the link command.  You may also need to
specify a <CODE>-L</CODE> option to tell the linker where to find the library.  For
example, if the library is installed in <TT>`/usr/local/mysql/lib'</TT>, use
<CODE>-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz</CODE> on the link command.

</P>
<P>
For clients that use MySQL header files, you may need to specify a
<CODE>-I</CODE> option when you compile them (for example,
<CODE>-I/usr/local/mysql/include</CODE>), so the compiler can find the header
files.

</P>
<P>
To make the above simpler on Unix we have provied the

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1720"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1721"></A>

</P>
<P>
The client library is almost thread-safe. The biggest problem is
that the subroutines in <TT>`net.c'</TT> that read from sockets are not
interrupt safe.  This was done with the thought that you might want to
have your own alarm that can break a long read to a server.  If you
install interrupt handlers for the <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> interrupt,
the socket handling should be thread-safe.

</P>
<P>
In the older binaries we distribute on our web site
(<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>), the client libraries are not normally
compiled with the thread-safe option (the Windows binaries are by
default compiled to be thread-safe). Newer binary distributions should
have both a normal and a thread-safe client library.

</P>
<P>
To get a threaded client where you can interrupt the client from other
threads and set timeouts when talking with the MySQL server, you should
use the <CODE>-lmysys</CODE>, <CODE>-lmystrings</CODE>, and <CODE>-ldbug</CODE> libraries and
the <CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> code that the server uses.

</P>
<P>
If you don't need interrupts or timeouts, you can just compile a
thread-safe client library <CODE>(mysqlclient_r)</CODE> and use this.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#C">8.4  MySQL C API</A>.  In this case you don't have to worry about the
<CODE>net_serv.o</CODE> object file or the other MySQL libraries.

</P>
<P>
When using a threaded client and you want to use timeouts and
interrupts, you can make great use of the routines in the
<TT>`thr_alarm.c'</TT> file.  If you are using routines from the
<CODE>mysys</CODE> library, the only thing you must remember is to call
<CODE>my_init()</CODE> first! See section <A HREF="manual.html#C_Thread_functions">8.4.4  C Threaded Function Descriptions</A>.

</P>
<P>
All functions except <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> are by default
thread-safe.  The following notes describe how to compile a thread-safe
client library and use it in a thread-safe manner.  (The notes below for
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> actually apply to <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> as
well, but because <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> is deprecated, you should be
using <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> anyway.)

</P>
<P>
To make <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> thread-safe, you must recompile the
client library with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; ./configure --enable-thread-safe-client
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a thread-safe client library <CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE>.
(Assuming your OS has a thread-safe <CODE>gethostbyname_r()</CODE> function.)
This library is thread-safe per connection.  You can let two threads
share the same connection with the following caveats:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Two threads can't send a query to the MySQL server at the same time on
the same connection.  In particular, you have to ensure that between a
<CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> no other thread is using
the same connection.
<LI>

Many threads can access different result sets that are retrieved with
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you use <CODE>mysql_use_result</CODE>, you have to ensure that no other thread
is using the same connection until the result set is closed.
However, it really is best for threaded clients that share the same
connection to use <CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.
<LI>

If you want to use multiple threads on the same connection, you must
have a mutex lock around your <CODE>mysql_query()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> call combination.  Once
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE> is ready, the lock can be released and other
threads may query the same connection.
<LI>

If you program with POSIX threads, you can use
<CODE>pthread_mutex_lock()</CODE> and <CODE>pthread_mutex_unlock()</CODE> to
establish and release a mutex lock.
</UL>

<P>
You need to know the following if you have a thread that is calling
MySQL functions which did not create the connection to the
MySQL database:

</P>
<P>
When you call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, MySQL will
create a thread-specific variable for the thread that is used by the
debug library (among other things).

</P>
<P>
If you call a MySQL function, before the thread has
called <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> or <CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>, the thread will
not have the necessary thread-specific variables in place and you are
likely to end up with a core dump sooner or later.

</P>
<P>
The get things to work smoothly you have to do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>my_init()</CODE> at the start of your program if it calls
any other MySQL function before calling <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
<LI>

Call <CODE>mysql_thread_init()</CODE> in the thread handler before calling
any MySQL function.
<LI>

In the thread, call <CODE>mysql_thread_end()</CODE> before calling
<CODE>pthread_exit()</CODE>.  This will free the memory used by MySQL
thread-specific variables.
</OL>

<P>
You may get some errors because of undefined symbols when linking your
client with <CODE>libmysqlclient_r</CODE>. In most cases this is because you haven't
included the thread libraries on the link/compile line.

</P>
<P>
When you link your program with <CODE>libmysqld</CODE>, you must also include

<H4><A NAME="libmysqld_restrictions" HREF="manual_toc.html#libmysqld_restrictions">8.4.9.3  Restrictions when using the Embedded MySQL Server</A></H4>

<P>
The embedded server has the following limitations:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

No support for ISAM tables. (This is mainly done to make the library smaller)
<LI>

No UDF functions.
<LI>

No stack trace on core dump.
<LI>

No internal RAID support. (This is not normally needed as most OS has
nowadays support for big files).
<LI>

You can set this up as a server or a master (no replication).
<LI>

You can't connect to the embedded server from an outside process with
sockets or TCP/IP.
</UL>

<P>
Some of these limitations can be changed by editing the <TT>`mysql_embed.h'</TT>
include file and recompiling MySQL.

instructions in section <A HREF="manual.html#Installing_source_tree">2.3.4  Installing from the Development Source Tree</A>.
If you are interested in MySQL internals, you should also subscribe
to our <CODE>internals</CODE> mailing list. This list is relatively low
traffic. For details on how to subscribe, please see

<H3><A NAME="MySQL_threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_threads">9.1.1  MySQL Threads</A></H3>

<P>
The MySQL server creates the following threads:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The TCP/IP connection thread handles all connection requests and
creates a new dedicated thread to handle the authentication and
SQL query processing for each connection.

<LI>

On Windows NT there is a named pipe handler thread that does the same work as
the TCP/IP connection thread on named pipe connect requests.

<LI>

The signal thread handles all signals.  This thread also normally handles
alarms and calls <CODE>process_alarm()</CODE> to force timeouts on connections
that have been idle too long.

<LI>

If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is compiled with <CODE>-DUSE_ALARM_THREAD</CODE>, a dedicated
thread that handles alarms is created.  This is only used on some systems where
there are problems with <CODE>sigwait()</CODE> or if one wants to use the
<CODE>thr_alarm()</CODE> code in ones application without a dedicated signal
handling thread.

<LI>

If one uses the <CODE>--flush_time=#</CODE> option, a dedicated thread is created
to flush all tables at the given interval.

<LI>

Every connection has its own thread.

<LI>

Every different table on which one uses <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> gets its
own thread.

<LI>

If you use <CODE>--master-host</CODE>, a slave replication thread will be
started to read and apply updates from the master.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="MySQL_test_suite" HREF="manual_toc.html#MySQL_test_suite">9.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1736"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1737"></A>

</P>
<P>
Until recently, our main full-coverage test suite was based on proprietary
customer data and for that reason has not been publicly available. The only
publicly available part of our testing process consisted of the <CODE>crash-me</CODE>
test, a Perl DBI/DBD benchmark found in the <CODE>sql-bench</CODE> directory, and
miscellaneous tests located in <CODE>tests</CODE> directory. The lack of a
standardised publicly available test suite has made it difficult for our users,
as well developers, to do regression tests on the MySQL code. To
address this problem, we have created a new test system that is included in
the source and binary distributions starting in Version 3.23.29.

</P>
<P>
The current set of test cases doesn't test everything in MySQL, but it
should catch most obvious bugs in the SQL processing code, OS/library
issues, and is quite thorough in testing replication.  Our eventual goal
is to have the tests cover 100% of the code.  We welcome contributions
to our test suite.  You may especially want to contribute tests that
examine the functionality critical to your system, as this will ensure
that all future MySQL releases will work well with your
applications.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="running_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#running_mysqltest">9.1.2.1  Running the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
The test system consist of a test language interpreter
(<CODE>mysqltest</CODE>), a shell script to run all
tests(<CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>), the actual test cases written in a special
test language, and their expected results.  To run the test suite on
your system after a build, type <CODE>make test</CODE> or
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run</CODE> from the source root.  If you have
installed a binary distribution, <CODE>cd</CODE> to the install root
(eg. <CODE>/usr/local/mysql</CODE>), and do <CODE>scripts/mysql-test-run</CODE>.
All tests should succeed.  If not, you should try to find out why and
report the problem if this is a bug in MySQL.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">9.1.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you have a copy of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> running on the machine where you want to
run the test suite you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using
ports <CODE>9306</CODE> and <CODE>9307</CODE>.  If one of those ports is taken, you should
edit <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> and change the values of the master and/or slave
port to one that is available.

</P>
<P>
You can run one individual test case with
<CODE>mysql-test/mysql-test-run test_name</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If one test fails, you should test running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with
the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to check if any other tests fails.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="extending_mysqltest" HREF="manual_toc.html#extending_mysqltest">9.1.2.2  Extending the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
You can use the <CODE>mysqltest</CODE> language to write your own test cases.
Unfortunately, we have not yet written full documentation for it - we plan to
do this shortly.  You can, however, look at our current test cases and use
them as an example.  The following points should help you get started:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The tests are located in <CODE>mysql-test/t/*.test</CODE>

<LI>

A test case consists of <CODE>;</CODE> terminated statements and is similar to the
input of <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line client.  A statement by default is a query
to be sent to MySQL server, unless it is recognised as internal
command (eg. <CODE>sleep</CODE>).

<LI>

All queries that produce results@-e.g., <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>SHOW</CODE>,
<CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, etc., must be preceded with <CODE>@/path/to/result/file</CODE>.  The
file must contain the expected results.  An easy way to generate the result
file is to run <CODE>mysqltest -r &#60; t/test-case-name.test</CODE> from
<CODE>mysql-test</CODE> directory, and then edit the generated result files, if
needed, to adjust them to the expected output.  In that case, be very careful
about not adding or deleting any invisible characters - make sure to only
change the text and/or delete lines.  If you have to insert a line, make sure
the fields are separated with a hard tab, and there is a hard tab at the end.
You may want to use <CODE>od -c</CODE> to make sure your text editor has not messed
anything up during edit.  We, of course, hope that you will never have to edit
the output of <CODE>mysqltest -r</CODE> as you only have to do it when you find a
bug.

<LI>

To be consistent with our setup, you should put your result files in
<CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory and name them <CODE>test_name.result</CODE>.  If the
test produces more than one result, you should use <CODE>test_name.a.result</CODE>,
<CODE>test_name.b.result</CODE>, etc.

<LI>

If a statement returns an error, you should on the line before the statement
specify with the <CODE>--error error-number</CODE>.  The error number can be
a list of possible error numbers separated with <CODE>','</CODE>.

<LI>

If you are writing a replication test case, you should on the first line of
the test file, put <CODE>source include/master-slave.inc;</CODE>.  To switch between
master and slave, use <CODE>connection master;</CODE> and <CODE>connection slave;</CODE>.
If you need to do something on an alternate connection, you can do
<CODE>connection master1;</CODE> for the master, and <CODE>connection slave1;</CODE> for
the slave.

<LI>

If you need to do something in a loop, you can use something like this:

<PRE>
let $1=1000;
while ($1)
{
 # do your queries here
 dec $1;
}
</PRE>

<LI>

To sleep between queries, use the <CODE>sleep</CODE> command. It supports fractions
of a second, so you can do <CODE>sleep 1.3;</CODE>, for example, to sleep 1.3
seconds.

<LI>

To run the slave with additional options for your test case, put them
in the command-line format in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-slave.opt</CODE>. For
the master, put them in <CODE>mysql-test/t/test_name-master.opt</CODE>.

<LI>

If you have a question about the test suite, or have a test case to contribute,
e-mail to <a HREF="mailto:internals@lists.mysql.com">internals@lists.mysql.com</a>. As the list does not accept
attachments, you should ftp all the relevant files to:

<H4><A NAME="Reporting_mysqltest_bugs" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reporting_mysqltest_bugs">9.1.2.3  Reporting Bugs in the MySQL Test Suite</A></H4>

<P>
If your MySQL version doesn't pass the test suite you should
do the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Don't send a bug report before you have found out as much as possible of
what when wrong!  When you do it, please use the <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script
so that we can get information about your system and <CODE>MySQL</CODE>
version. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.
<LI>

Make sure to include the output of <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>, as well as
contents of all <CODE>.reject</CODE> files in <CODE>mysql-test/r</CODE> directory.
<LI>

If a test in the test suite fails, check if the test fails also when run
by its own:


<PRE>
cd mysql-test
mysql-test-run --local test-name
</PRE>

If this fails, then you should configure MySQL with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> and run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the
<CODE>--debug</CODE> option. If this also fails send the trace file
<TT>`var/tmp/master.trace'</TT> to ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret
so that we can examine it. Please remember to also include a full
description of your system, the version of the mysqld binary and how you
compiled it.

<LI>

Try also to run <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to
see if there is any other test that fails.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL yourself, check our manual for how
to compile MySQL on your platform or, preferable, use one of
the binaries we have compiled for you at
<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.  All our standard binaries should
pass the test suite !

<LI>

If you get an error, like <CODE>Result length mismatch</CODE> or <CODE>Result
content mismatch</CODE> it means that the output of the test didn't match
exactly the expected output. This could be a bug in MySQL or
that your mysqld version produces slight different results under some
circumstances.

Failed test results are put in a file with the same base name as the
result file with the <CODE>.reject</CODE> extension.  If your test case is
failing, you should do a diff on the two files.  If you cannot see how
they are different, examine both with <CODE>od -c</CODE> and also check their
lengths.

<LI>

If a test fails totally, you should check the logs file in the
<CODE>mysql-test/var/log</CODE> directory for hints of what went wrong.

<LI>

If you have compiled MySQL with debugging you can try to debug this
by running <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE> with the <CODE>--gdb</CODE> and/or <CODE>--debug</CODE>
options.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

If you have not compiled MySQL for debugging you should probably
do that.  Just specify the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> options to <CODE>configure</CODE>!

There are two ways to add new functions to MySQL:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>You can add the function through the user-definable function (UDF)

interface.  User-definable functions are added and removed dynamically using
the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_FUNCTION">9.2.1  <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION/DROP FUNCTION</CODE> Syntax</A>.

<LI>You can add the function as a native (built in) MySQL function.

Native functions are compiled into the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server and become
available on a permanent basis.
</UL>

<P>
Each method has advantages and disadvantages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you write a user-definable function, you must install the object file
in addition to the server itself.  If you compile your function into the
server, you don't need to do that.
<LI>

You can add UDFs to a binary MySQL distribution.  Native functions
require you to modify a source distribution.
<LI>

If you upgrade your MySQL distribution, you can continue to use your
previously installed UDFs.  For native functions, you must repeat your
modifications each time you upgrade.
</UL>

<P>
Whichever method you use to add new functions, they may be used just like
native functions such as <CODE>ABS()</CODE> or <CODE>SOUNDEX()</CODE>.

<P>
A user-definable function (UDF) is a way to extend MySQL with a new
function that works like native (built in) MySQL functions such as
<CODE>ABS()</CODE> and <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> is a new option for MySQL Version 3.23.  An
<CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> function works exactly like a native MySQL
<CODE>GROUP</CODE> function like <CODE>SUM</CODE> or <CODE>COUNT()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> saves the function's name, type, and shared library
name in the <CODE>mysql.func</CODE> system table.  You must have the
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> privileges for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> database
to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
All active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In
this case, UDF initialisation is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.
(An active function is one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>
and not removed with <CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
For instructions on writing user-definable functions, see section <A HREF="manual.html#Adding_functions">9.2  Adding New Functions to MySQL</A>.  For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or
C++, your operating system must support dynamic loading and you must have
compiled <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dynamically (not statically).

</P>
<P>
Note that to make <CODE>AGGREGATE</CODE> work, you must have a
<CODE>mysql.func</CODE> table that contains the column <CODE>type</CODE>.  If this
is not the case, you should run the script
<CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE> to get this fixed.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX1752"></A>

</P>

<P>
For the UDF mechanism to work, functions must be written in C or C++ and your
operating system must support dynamic loading.  The MySQL source
distribution includes a file <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that defines 5 new
functions.  Consult this file to see how UDF calling conventions work.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be able to use UDF functions, you should configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-rdynamic</CODE> The reason is that to on
many platforms (including Linux) you can load a dynamic library (with
<CODE>dlopen()</CODE>) from a static linked program, which you would get if
you are using <CODE>--with-mysqld-ldflags=-all-static</CODE> If you want to
use an UDF that needs to access symbols from <CODE>mysqld</CODE> (like the
<CODE>methaphone</CODE> example in <TT>`sql/udf_example.cc'</TT> that uses
<CODE>default_charset_info</CODE>), you must link the program with
<CODE>-rdynamic</CODE> (see <CODE>man dlopen</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
For each function that you want to use in SQL statements, you should define
corresponding C (or C++) functions.  In the discussion below, the name
``xxx'' is used for an example function name.  To distinquish between SQL and
C/C++ usage, <CODE>XXX()</CODE> (uppercase) indicates a SQL function call, and
<CODE>xxx()</CODE> (lowercase) indicates a C/C++ function call.

</P>
<P>
The C/C++ functions that you write to implement the interface for
<CODE>XXX()</CODE> are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>xxx()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
The main function.  This is where the function result is computed.
The correspondence between the SQL type and return type of your C/C++
function is shown here:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>SQL type</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>C/C++ type</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>STRING</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>char *</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>INTEGER</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>long long</CODE>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>REAL</CODE> </TD><TD> <CODE>double</CODE>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<DT><CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The initialisation function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It can be used to:


<UL>
<LI>

Check the number of arguments to <CODE>XXX()</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that the arguments are of a required type or, alternatively,
tell MySQL to coerce arguments to the types you want when
the main function is called.
<LI>

Allocate any memory required by the main function.
<LI>

Specify the maximum length of the result.
<LI>

Specify (for <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions) the maximum number of decimals.
<LI>

Specify whether the result can be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</UL>

<DT><CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> (optional)
<DD>
The deinitialisation function for <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  It should deallocate any
memory allocated by the initialisation function.
</DL>

<P>
When a SQL statement invokes <CODE>XXX()</CODE>, MySQL calls the
initialisation function <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> to let it perform any required
setup, such as argument checking or memory allocation.  If <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
returns an error, the SQL statement is aborted with an error message and the
main and deinitialisation functions are not called.  Otherwise, the main
function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is called once for each row.  After all rows have been
processed, the deinitialisation function <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> is called so it
can perform any required cleanup.

</P>
<P>
For aggregate functions (like <CODE>SUM()</CODE>), you must also provide the
following functions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
Reset sum and insert the argument as the initial value for a new group.
<DT><CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> (required)
<DD>
Add the argument to the old sum.
</DL>

<P>
When using aggregate UDF functions MySQL works the following way:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Call <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> to let the aggregate function allocate the memory it
will need to store results.
<LI>

Sort the table according to the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> expression.
<LI>

For the first row in a new group, call the <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> function.
<LI>

For each new row that belongs in the same group, call the
<CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> function.
<LI>

When the group changes or after the last row has been processed,
call <CODE>xxx()</CODE> to get the result for the aggregate.
<LI>

Repeat 3-5 until all rows has been processed
<LI>

Call <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> to let the UDF free any memory it has allocated.
</OL>

<P>
All functions must be thread-safe (not just the main function,
but the initialisation and deinitialisation functions as well). This means
that you are not allowed to allocate any global or static variables that
change!  If you need memory, you should allocate it in <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>
and free it in <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
The main function should be declared as shown here.  Note that the return
type and parameters differ, depending on whether you will declare the SQL
function <CODE>XXX()</CODE> to return <CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, or <CODE>REAL</CODE>
in the <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> statement:

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>STRING</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
          char *result, unsigned long *length,
          char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
long long xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
For <CODE>REAL</CODE> functions:

</P>

<PRE>
double xxx(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
The initialisation and deinitialisation functions are declared like this:

</P>

<PRE>
my_bool xxx_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message);

void xxx_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid);
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>initid</CODE> parameter is passed to all three functions.  It points to a
<CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure that is used to communicate information between
functions.  The <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure members are listed below.  The
initialisation function should fill in any members that it wishes to change.
(To use the default for a member, leave it unchanged.):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>my_bool maybe_null</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should set <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE> if <CODE>xxx()</CODE>
can return <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  The default value is <CODE>1</CODE> if any of the
arguments are declared <CODE>maybe_null</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int decimals</CODE>
<DD>
Number of decimals.  The default value is the maximum number of decimals in
the arguments passed to the main function.  (For example, if the function is
passed <CODE>1.34</CODE>, <CODE>1.345</CODE>, and <CODE>1.3</CODE>, the default would be 3,
because <CODE>1.345</CODE> has 3 decimals.

<DT><CODE>unsigned int max_length</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum length of the string result.  The default value differs depending
on the result type of the function.  For string functions, the default is the
length of the longest argument.  For integer functions, the default is 21
digits.  For real functions, the default is 13 plus the number of decimals
indicated by <CODE>initid-&#62;decimals</CODE>.  (For numeric functions, the length
includes any sign or decimal point characters.)

If you want to return a blob, you can set this to 65K or 16M; this
memory is not allocated but used to decide which column type to use if
there is a need to temporary store the data.

<DT><CODE>char *ptr</CODE>
<DD>
A pointer that the function can use for its own purposes.  For example,
functions can use <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to communicate allocated memory
between functions.  In <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>, allocate the memory and assign it
to this pointer:


<PRE>
initid-&#62;ptr = allocated_memory;
</PRE>

In <CODE>xxx()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE>, refer to <CODE>initid-&#62;ptr</CODE> to use
or deallocate the memory.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1754"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here follows a description of the different functions you need to define
when you want to create an aggregate UDF function.

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx_reset(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
                char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
This function is called when MySQL finds the first row in a new group.
In the function you should reset any internal summary variables and then set
the given argument as the first argument in the group.

</P>
<P>
In many cases this is implemented internally by reseting all variables
and then calling <CODE>xxx_add()</CODE>.

</P>

<PRE>
char *xxx_add(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
              char *is_null, char *error);
</PRE>

<P>
This function is called for all rows that belongs to the same group,
except for the first row. In this you should add the value in UDF_ARGS
to your internal summary variable.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>xxx()</CODE> function should be declared identical as when you
define a simple UDF function. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_calling">9.2.2.1  UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
This function is called when all rows in the group has been processed.
You should normally never access the <CODE>args</CODE> variable here but
return your value based on your internal summary variables.

</P>
<P>
All argument processing in <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx_add()</CODE>
should be done identically as for normal UDF functions. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_arguments">9.2.2.3  Argument Processing</A>.

</P>
<P>
The return value handling in <CODE>xxx()</CODE> should be done identically as
for a normal UDF. See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_return_values">9.2.2.4  Return Values and Error Handling</A>.

</P>
<P>
The pointer argument to <CODE>is_null</CODE> and <CODE>error</CODE> is the same for
all calls to <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE>, <CODE>xxx_add()</CODE> and <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.
You can use this to remember that you got an error or if the <CODE>xxx()</CODE>
function should return <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Note that you should not store a string
into <CODE>*error</CODE>!  This is just a 1 byte flag!

</P>
<P>
<CODE>is_null</CODE> is reset for each group (before calling <CODE>xxx_reset()</CODE>.
<CODE>error</CODE> is never reset.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>isnull</CODE> or <CODE>error</CODE> are set after <CODE>xxx()</CODE> then MySQL
will return <CODE>NULL</CODE> as the result for the group function.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="UDF_arguments" HREF="manual_toc.html#UDF_arguments">9.2.2.3  Argument Processing</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1755"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1756"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>args</CODE> parameter points to a <CODE>UDF_ARGS</CODE> structure that has the
members listed here:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>unsigned int arg_count</CODE>
<DD>
The number of arguments.  Check this value in the initialisation function
if you want your function to be called with a particular number of arguments.
For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_count != 2)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires two arguments");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>enum Item_result *arg_type</CODE>
<DD>
The types for each argument.  The possible type values are
<CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, and <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>.

To make sure that arguments are of a given type and return an
error if they are not, check the <CODE>arg_type</CODE> array in the initialisation
function.  For example:


<PRE>
if (args-&#62;arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT ||
    args-&#62;arg_type[1] != INT_RESULT)
{
    strcpy(message,"XXX() requires a string and an integer");
    return 1;
}
</PRE>

As an alternative to requiring your function's arguments to be of particular
types, you can use the initialisation function to set the <CODE>arg_type</CODE>
elements to the types you want.  This causes MySQL to coerce
arguments to those types for each call to <CODE>xxx()</CODE>.  For example, to
specify coercion of the first two arguments to string and integer, do this in
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE>:


<PRE>
args-&#62;arg_type[0] = STRING_RESULT;
args-&#62;arg_type[1] = INT_RESULT;
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>char **args</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> communicates information to the initialisation function
about the general nature of the arguments your function was called with.  For a
constant argument <CODE>i</CODE>, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> points to the argument
value.  (See below for instructions on how to access the value properly.)
For a non-constant argument, <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> is <CODE>0</CODE>.
A constant argument is an expression that uses only constants, such as
<CODE>3</CODE> or <CODE>4*7-2</CODE> or <CODE>SIN(3.14)</CODE>.  A non-constant argument is an
expression that refers to values that may change from row to row, such as
column names or functions that are called with non-constant arguments.

For each invocation of the main function, <CODE>args-&#62;args</CODE> contains the
actual arguments that are passed for the row currently being processed.

Functions can refer to an argument <CODE>i</CODE> as follows:


<UL>
<LI>

An argument of type <CODE>STRING_RESULT</CODE> is given as a string pointer plus a
length, to allow handling of binary data or data of arbitrary length.  The
string contents are available as <CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> and the string length
is <CODE>args-&#62;lengths[i]</CODE>.  You should not assume that strings are
null-terminated.

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>long long</CODE> value:


<PRE>
long long int_val;
int_val = *((long long*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

<LI>

For an argument of type <CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, you must cast
<CODE>args-&#62;args[i]</CODE> to a <CODE>double</CODE> value:


<PRE>
double    real_val;
real_val = *((double*) args-&#62;args[i]);
</PRE>

</UL>

<DT><CODE>unsigned long *lengths</CODE>
<DD>
For the initialisation function, the <CODE>lengths</CODE> array indicates the
maximum string length for each argument. You should not change these.
For each invocation of the main function, <CODE>lengths</CODE> contains the
actual lengths of any string arguments that are passed for the row
currently being processed.  For arguments of types <CODE>INT_RESULT</CODE> or
<CODE>REAL_RESULT</CODE>, <CODE>lengths</CODE> still contains the maximum length of
the argument (as for the initialisation function).

The initialisation function should return <CODE>0</CODE> if no error occurred and
<CODE>1</CODE> otherwise.  If an error occurs, <CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> should store a
null-terminated error message in the <CODE>message</CODE> parameter.  The message
will be returned to the client.  The message buffer is
<CODE>MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE</CODE> characters long, but you should try to keep the
message to less than 80 characters so that it fits the width of a standard
terminal screen.

</P>
<P>
The return value of the main function <CODE>xxx()</CODE> is the function value, for
<CODE>long long</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> functions.  A string functions should
return a pointer to the result and store the length of the string in the
<CODE>length</CODE> arguments.

</P>
<P>
Set these to the contents and length of the return value.  For example:

<PRE>
memcpy(result, "result string", 13);
*length = 13;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>result</CODE> buffer that is passed to the calc function is 255 byte
big. If your result fits in this, you don't have to worry about memory
allocation for results.

</P>
<P>
If your string function needs to return a string longer than 255 bytes,
you must allocate the space for it with <CODE>malloc()</CODE> in your
<CODE>xxx_init()</CODE> function or your <CODE>xxx()</CODE> function and free it in
your <CODE>xxx_deinit()</CODE> function.  You can store the allocated memory
in the <CODE>ptr</CODE> slot in the <CODE>UDF_INIT</CODE> structure for reuse by
future <CODE>xxx()</CODE> calls.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#UDF_calling">9.2.2.1  UDF Calling Sequences for simple functions</A>.

</P>
<P>
To indicate a return value of <CODE>NULL</CODE> in the main function, set
<CODE>is_null</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
*is_null = 1;
</PRE>

<P>
To indicate an error return in the main function, set the <CODE>error</CODE>
parameter to <CODE>1</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
*error = 1;
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>xxx()</CODE> sets <CODE>*error</CODE> to <CODE>1</CODE> for any row, the function
value is <CODE>NULL</CODE> for the current row and for any subsequent rows
processed by the statement in which <CODE>XXX()</CODE> was invoked.  (<CODE>xxx()</CODE>
will not even be called for subsequent rows.) <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: in
MySQL versions prior to 3.22.10, you should set both <CODE>*error</CODE>

Files implementing UDFs must be compiled and installed on the host where the
server runs.  This process is described below for the example UDF file
<TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT> that is included in the MySQL source
distribution.  This file contains the following functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>metaphon()</CODE> returns a metaphon string of the string argument.
This is something like a soundex string, but it's more tuned for English.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_double()</CODE> returns the sum of the ASCII values of the
characters in its arguments, divided by the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>myfunc_int()</CODE> returns the sum of the length of its arguments.
<LI>

<CODE>sequence([const int])</CODE> returns an sequence starting from the given
number or 1 if no number has been given.
<LI>

<CODE>lookup()</CODE> returns the IP number for a hostname.
<LI>

<CODE>reverse_lookup()</CODE> returns the hostname for an IP number.
The function may be called with a string <CODE>"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"</CODE> or
four numbers.
</UL>

<P>
A dynamically loadable file should be compiled as a sharable object file,
using a command something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gcc -shared -o udf_example.so myfunc.cc
</PRE>

<P>
You can easily find out the correct compiler options for your system by
running this command in the <TT>`sql'</TT> directory of your MySQL
source tree:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; make udf_example.o
</PRE>

<P>
You should run a compile command similar to the one that <CODE>make</CODE> displays,
except that you should remove the <CODE>-c</CODE> option near the end of the line
and add <CODE>-o udf_example.so</CODE> to the end of the line.  (On some systems,
you may need to leave  the <CODE>-c</CODE> on the command.)

</P>
<P>
Once you compile a shared object containing UDFs, you must install it
and tell MySQL about it.  Compiling a shared object from
<TT>`udf_example.cc'</TT> produces a file named something like
<TT>`udf_example.so'</TT> (the exact name may vary from platform to platform).
Copy this file to some directory searched by <CODE>ld</CODE>, such as
<TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>.  On many systems, you can set the <CODE>LD_LIBRARY</CODE> or
<CODE>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> environment variable to point at the directory where
you have your UDF function files. The <CODE>dlopen</CODE> manual page tells you
which variable you should use on your system. You should set this in
<CODE>mysql.server</CODE> or <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> startup scripts and restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
After the library is installed, notify <CODE>mysqld</CODE> about the new
functions with these commands:

to create and drop functions.

</P>
<P>
You should not use <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> to add a function that has already
been created.  If you need to reinstall a function, you should remove it with
<CODE>DROP FUNCTION</CODE> and then reinstall it with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE>.  You
would need to do this, for example, if you recompile a new version of your
function, so that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets the new version.  Otherwise, the server
will continue to use the old version.

</P>
<P>
Active functions are reloaded each time the server starts, unless you start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-grant-tables</CODE> option.  In this case, UDF
initialisation is skipped and UDFs are unavailable.  (An active function is
one that has been loaded with <CODE>CREATE FUNCTION</CODE> and not removed with

<A NAME="IDX1764"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1765"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1766"></A>

</P>
<P>
The procedure for adding a new native function is described here.  Note
that you cannot add native functions to a binary distribution because
the procedure involves modifying MySQL source code.  You must
compile MySQL yourself from a source distribution.  Also note
that if you migrate to another version of MySQL (for example,
when a new version is released), you will need to repeat the procedure
with the new version.

</P>
<P>
To add a new native MySQL function, follow these steps:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Add one line to <TT>`lex.h'</TT> that defines the function name in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array.
<LI>

If the function prototype is simple (just takes zero, one, two or three
arguments), you should in lex.h specify SYM(FUNC_ARG#) (where # is the
number of arguments) as the second argument in the
<CODE>sql_functions[]</CODE> array and add a function that creates a function
object in <TT>`item_create.cc'</TT>.  Take a look at <CODE>"ABS"</CODE> and
<CODE>create_funcs_abs()</CODE> for an example of this.

If the function prototype is complicated (for example takes a variable number
of arguments), you should add two lines to <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT>. One
indicates the preprocessor symbol that <CODE>yacc</CODE> should define (this
should be added at the beginning of the file). Then define the function
parameters and add an ``item'' with these parameters to the
<CODE>simple_expr</CODE> parsing rule.  For an example, check all occurrences
of <CODE>ATAN</CODE> in <TT>`sql_yacc.yy'</TT> to see how this is done.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.h'</TT>, declare a class inheriting from <CODE>Item_num_func</CODE> or
<CODE>Item_str_func</CODE>, depending on whether your function returns a number or a
string.
<LI>

In <TT>`item_func.cc'</TT>, add one of the following declarations, depending
on whether you are defining a numeric or string function:

<PRE>
double   Item_func_newname::val()
longlong Item_func_newname::val_int()
String  *Item_func_newname::Str(String *str)
</PRE>

If you inherit your object from any of the standard items (like
<CODE>Item_num_func</CODE> you probably only have to define one of the above
functions and let the parent object take care of the other functions.
For example, the <CODE>Item_str_func</CODE> class defines a <CODE>val()</CODE> function
that executes <CODE>atof()</CODE> on the value returned by <CODE>::str()</CODE>.

<LI>

You should probably also define the following object function:

<PRE>
void Item_func_newname::fix_length_and_dec()
</PRE>

This function should at least calculate <CODE>max_length</CODE> based on the
given arguments. <CODE>max_length</CODE> is the maximum number of characters
the function may return.  This function should also set <CODE>maybe_null
= 0</CODE> if the main function can't return a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value.  The
function can check if any of the function arguments can return
<CODE>NULL</CODE> by checking the arguments <CODE>maybe_null</CODE> variable. You
can take a look at <CODE>Item_func_mod::fix_length_and_dec</CODE> for a
typical example of how to do this.
</OL>

<P>
All functions must be thread-safe (in other words, don't use any global or
static variables in the functions without protecting them with mutexes).

</P>
<P>
If you want to return <CODE>NULL</CODE>, from <CODE>::val()</CODE>, <CODE>::val_int()</CODE>
or <CODE>::str()</CODE> you should set <CODE>null_value</CODE> to 1 and return 0.

</P>
<P>
For <CODE>::str()</CODE> object functions, there are some additional
considerations to be aware of:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>String *str</CODE> argument provides a string buffer that may be
used to hold the result. (For more information about the <CODE>String</CODE> type,
take a look at the <TT>`sql_string.h'</TT> file.)
<LI>

The <CODE>::str()</CODE> function should return the string that holds the result or
<CODE>(char*) 0</CODE> if the result is <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

All current string functions try to avoid allocating any memory unless
absolutely necessary!

This chapter lists some common problems and error messages that users have
run into.  You will learn how to figure out what the problem is, and what

problems.

<H2><A NAME="What_is_crashing" HREF="manual_toc.html#What_is_crashing">A.1  How to Determine What Is Causing Problems</A></H2>

<P>
When you run into problems, the first thing you should do is to find out
which program / piece of equipment is causing problems:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

If you have one of the following symptoms, then it is probably a hardware
(like memory, motherboard, CPU, or hard disk) or kernel problem:

<UL>
<LI>

The keyboard doesn't work.  This can normally be checked by pressing
Caps Lock. If the Caps Lock light doesn't change you have to replace
your keyboard.  (Before doing this, you should try to reboot
your computer and check all cables to the keyboard.)
<LI>

The mouse pointer doesn't move.
<LI>

The machine doesn't answer to a remote machine's pings.
<LI>

Different, unrelated programs don't behave correctly.
<LI>

If your system rebooted unexpectedly (a faulty user level program should
<STRONG>never</STRONG> be able to take down your system).
</UL>

In this case you should start by checking all your cables and run some
diagnostic tool to check your hardware!
You should also check if there are any patches, updates, or service
packs for your operating system that could likely solve your problems.
Check also that all your libraries (like glibc) are up to date.

It's always good to use a machine with ECC memory to discover
memory problems early!
<LI>

If your keyboard is locked up, you may be able to fix this by
logging into your machine from another machine and execute
<CODE>kbd_mode -a</CODE> on it.

<LI>

Please examine your system log file (/var/log/messages or similar) for
reasons for your problems.  If you think the problem is in MySQL
then you should also examine MySQL's log files. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Update_log">4.9.3  The Update Log</A>.

<LI>

If you don't think you have hardware problems, you should try to find
out which program is causing problems.

Try using <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>ps</CODE>, <CODE>taskmanager</CODE>, or some similar program,
to check which program is taking all CPU or is locking the machine.

<LI>

Check with <CODE>top</CODE>, <CODE>df</CODE>, or a similar program if you are out of
memory, disk space, open files, or some other critical resource.

<LI>

If the problem is some runaway process, you can always try to kill it. If it
doesn't want to die, there is probably a bug in the operating system.
</UL>

<P>
If after you have examined all other possibilities and you have
concluded that it's the MySQL server or a MySQL client
that is causing the problem, it's time to do a bug report for our
mailing list or our support team.  In the bug report, try to give a
very detailed description of how the system is behaving and what you think is
happening. You should also state why you think it's MySQL that
is causing the problems.  Take into consideration all the situations in
this chapter. State any problems exactly how they appear when you
examine your system. Use the 'cut and paste' method for any output
and/or error messages from programs and/or log files!

</P>
<P>
Try to describe in detail which program is not working and all
symptoms you see!  We have in the past received many bug reports that just
state "the system doesn't work".  This doesn't provide us with any
information about what could be the problem.

</P>
<P>
If a program fails, it's always useful to know:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Has the program in question made a segmentation fault (core dumped)?
<LI>

Is the program taking up the whole CPU? Check with <CODE>top</CODE>. Let the
program run for a while, it may be evaluating something heavy.
<LI>

If it's the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server that is causing problems, can you
do <CODE>mysqladmin -u root ping</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE>?
<LI>

What does a client program say (try with <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for example)
when you try to connect to the MySQL server?
Does the client jam?  Do you get any output from the program?
</UL>

<P>
When sending a bug report, you should of follow the outlines
described in this manual. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Asking_questions">1.6.1.2  Asking Questions or Reporting Bugs</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Gone_away" HREF="manual_toc.html#Gone_away">A.2.2  <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
This section also covers the related <CODE>Lost connection to server
during query</CODE> error.

</P>
<P>
The most common reason for the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is that the server timed out and closed the connection. By default, the
server closes the connection after 8 hours if nothing has happened. You
can change the time limit by setting the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> variable when
you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another common reason to receive the <CODE>MySQL server has gone away</CODE> error
is because you have issued a ``close'' on your MySQL connection
and then tried to run a query on the closed connection.

</P>
<P>
If you have a script, you just have to issue the query again for the client
to do an automatic reconnection.

</P>
<P>
You normally can get the following error codes in this case
(which one you get is OS-dependent):

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Error code</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR</CODE> </TD><TD> The client couldn't send a question to the
server.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CODE>CR_SERVER_LOST</CODE> </TD><TD> The client didn't get an error when writing
to the server, but it didn't get a full answer (or any answer) to the question.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
You will also get this error if someone has kills the running thread with
<CODE>kill #threadid#</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check that the MySQL hasn't died by executing <CODE>mysqladmin
version</CODE> and examining the uptime.  If the problem is that mysqld
crashed you should concentrate one finding the reason for the crash.
You should in this case start by checking if issuing the query again
will kill MySQL again. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can also get these errors if you send a query to the server that is
incorrect or too large. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> gets a packet that is too large
or out of order, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and
closes the connection.  If you need big queries (for example, if you are
working with big <CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns), you can increase the query limit by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>-O max_allowed_packet=#</CODE> option
(default 1M). The extra memory is allocated on demand, so <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will
allocate more memory only when you issue a big query or when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> must
return a big result row!

</P>
<P>
You will also get a lost connection if you are sending a packet &#62;= 16M
if your client is older than 4.0.8 and your server is 4.0.8 and above, or
the other way around.

</P>
<P>
If you want to make a bug report regarding this problem, be sure that
you include the following information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Include information if MySQL died or not. (You can find this in the
<CODE>hostname.err file</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.
<LI>

If a specific query kills <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and the involved tables where
checked with <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> before you did the query, can you do
a test case for this? See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case When You Experience Table Corruption</A>.
<LI>

What is the value of the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> variable in the MySQL server ?
<CODE>mysqladmin variables</CODE> gives you the value of this

<H3><A NAME="Can_not_connect_to_server" HREF="manual_toc.html#Can_not_connect_to_server">A.2.3  <CODE>Can't connect to [local] MySQL server</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
A MySQL client on Unix can connect to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server in two
different ways: Unix sockets, which connect through a file in the file
system (default <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>) or TCP/IP, which connects
through a port number.  Unix sockets are faster than TCP/IP but can only
be used when connecting to a server on the same computer.  Unix sockets
are used if you don't specify a hostname or if you specify the special
hostname <CODE>localhost</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
On Windows, if the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is running on 9x/Me, you can
connect only via TCP/IP. If the server is running on NT/2000/XP and
mysqld is started with <CODE>--enable-named-pipe</CODE>, you
can also connect with named pipes. The name of the named pipe is MySQL.
If you don't give a hostname when connecting to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, a MySQL
client will first try to connect to the named pipe, and if this doesn't
work it will connect to the TCP/IP port.  You can force the use of named
pipes on Windows by using <CODE>.</CODE> as the hostname.

</P>
<P>
The error (2002) <CODE>Can't connect to ...</CODE> normally means that there
isn't a MySQL server running on the system or that you are
using a wrong socket file or TCP/IP port when trying to connect to the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
Start by checking (using <CODE>ps</CODE> or the task manager on Windows) that
there is a process running named <CODE>mysqld</CODE> on your server!  If there
isn't any <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process, you should start one. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Starting_server">2.4.2  Problems Starting the MySQL Server</A>.

</P>
<P>
If a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process is running, you can check the server by
trying these different connections (the port number and socket pathname
might be different in your setup, of course):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin version
shell&#62; mysqladmin variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version variables
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` --port=3306 version
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h 'ip for your host' version
shell&#62; mysqladmin --protocol=socket --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock version
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of backquotes rather than forward quotes with the <CODE>hostname</CODE>
command; these cause the output of <CODE>hostname</CODE> (that is, the current
hostname) to be substituted into the <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> command.

</P>
<P>
Here are some reasons the <CODE>Can't connect to local MySQL server</CODE>
error might occur:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not running.
<LI>

You are running on a system that uses MIT-pthreads.
If you are running on a system that doesn't have native threads,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses the MIT-pthreads package.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.  However,
not all MIT-pthreads versions support Unix sockets. On a system
without sockets support you must always specify the hostname explicitly
when connecting to the server. Try using this command to check the
connection to the server:

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin -h `hostname` version
</PRE>

<LI>

Someone has removed the Unix socket that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> uses (default
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.sock'</TT>).  You might have a <CODE>cron</CODE> job that removes
the MySQL socket (for example, a job that removes old files
from the <TT>`/tmp'</TT> directory).  You can always run <CODE>mysqladmin
version</CODE> and check that the socket <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> is trying to use
really exists.  The fix in this case is to change the <CODE>cron</CODE> job to
not remove <TT>`mysqld.sock'</TT> or to place the socket somewhere else.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You have started the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with
the <CODE>--socket=/path/to/socket</CODE> option.  If you change the socket
pathname for the server, you must also notify the MySQL clients
about the new path. You can do this by providing the socket path
as an argument to the client. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_mysql.sock">A.4.5  How to Protect or Change the MySQL Socket File <TT>`/tmp/mysql.sock'</TT></A>.
<LI>

You are using Linux and one thread has died (core dumped).  In this case
you must kill the other <CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads (for example, with the
<CODE>mysql_zap</CODE> script before you can start a new MySQL
server.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.
<LI>

You may not have read and write privilege to either the directory that holds
the socket file or privilege to the socket file itself. In this case you
have to either change the privilege for the directory / file or restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> so that it uses a directory that you can access.
</UL>

<P>
If you get the error message <CODE>Can't connect to MySQL server on
some_hostname</CODE>, you can try the following things to find out what the
problem is :

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Check if the server is up by doing <CODE>telnet your-host-name
tcp-ip-port-number</CODE> and press Enter a couple of times.  If there
is a MySQL server running on this port you should get a
responses that includes the version number of the running MySQL
server.  If you get an error like <CODE>telnet: Unable to connect to
remote host: Connection refused</CODE>, then there is no server running on the
given port.
<LI>

Try connecting to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon on the local machine and check
the TCP/IP port that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> it's configured to use (variable <CODE>port</CODE>) with
<CODE>mysqladmin variables</CODE>.
<LI>

Check that your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is not started with the
<CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="Blocked_host" HREF="manual_toc.html#Blocked_host">A.2.4  <CODE>Host '...' is blocked</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you get an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Host 'hostname' is blocked because of many connection errors.
Unblock with 'mysqladmin flush-hosts'
</PRE>

<P>
this means that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has gotten a lot (<CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE>)
of connect requests from the host <CODE>'hostname'</CODE> that have been interrupted
in the middle. After <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> failed requests, <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
assumes that something is wrong (like an attack from a cracker), and
blocks the site from further connections until someone executes the command
<CODE>mysqladmin flush-hosts</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
By default, <CODE>mysqld</CODE> blocks a host after 10 connection errors.
You can easily adjust this by starting the server like this:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; safe_mysqld -O max_connect_errors=10000 &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if you get this error message for a given host, you should first
check that there isn't anything wrong with TCP/IP connections from that
host.  If your TCP/IP connections aren't working, it won't do you any good to
increase the value of the <CODE>max_connect_errors</CODE> variable!

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Too_many_connections" HREF="manual_toc.html#Too_many_connections">A.2.5  <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you get the error <CODE>Too many connections</CODE> when you try to connect
to MySQL, this means that there is already <CODE>max_connections</CODE>
clients connected to the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server.

</P>
<P>
If you need more connections than the default (100), then you should restart
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with a bigger value for the <CODE>max_connections</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> actually allows (<CODE>max_connections</CODE>+1)
clients to connect.  The last connection is reserved for a user with the
<CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege.  By not giving this privilege to normal
users (they shouldn't need this), an administrator with this privilege
can log in and use <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> to find out what could be
wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_PROCESSLIST">4.5.6.6  <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
The maximum number of connects MySQL is depending on how good
the thread library is on a given platform. Linux or Solaris should be
able to support 500-1000 simultaneous connections, depending on how much
RAM you have and what your clients are doing.

<H3><A NAME="Non-transactional_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Non-transactional_tables">A.2.6  <CODE>Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1776"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you get the error/warning: <CODE>Warning: Some non-transactional
changed tables couldn't be rolled back</CODE> when trying to do a
<CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>, this means that some of the tables you used in the
transaction didn't support transactions.  These non-transactional tables
will not be affected by the <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
The most typical case when this happens is when you have tried to create
a table of a type that is not supported by your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary.
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't support a table type (or if the table type is
disabled by a startup option) , it will instead create the table type
with the table type that is most resembles to the one you requested,
probably <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the table type for a table by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_TABLE_STATUS">4.5.6.2  <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
You can check the extensions your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> binary supports by doing:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>show variables like 'have_%'</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Out_of_memory" HREF="manual_toc.html#Out_of_memory">A.2.7  <CODE>Out of memory</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
If you issue a query and get something like the following error:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql: Out of memory at line 42, 'malloc.c'
mysql: needed 8136 byte (8k), memory in use: 12481367 bytes (12189k)
ERROR 2008: MySQL client ran out of memory
</PRE>

<P>
note that the error refers to the MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE>. The
reason for this error is simply that the client does not have enough memory to
store the whole result.

</P>
<P>
To remedy the problem, first check that your query is correct. Is it
reasonable that it should return so many rows?  If so,
you can use <CODE>mysql --quick</CODE>, which uses <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
to retrieve the result set.  This places less of a load on the client (but
more on the server).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Packet_too_large" HREF="manual_toc.html#Packet_too_large">A.2.8  <CODE>Packet too large</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
When a MySQL client or the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server gets a packet bigger
than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes, it issues a <CODE>Packet too large</CODE>
error and closes the connection.

</P>
<P>
In MySQL 3.23 the biggest possible packet is 16M (due to limits in the
client/server protocol). In MySQL 4.0.1 and up, this is only limited by
the amount on memory you have on your server (up to a theoretical
maximum of 2G).

</P>
<P>
A communication packet is a single SQL statement sent to the MySQL server
or a single row that is sent to the client.

</P>
<P>
When a MySQL client or the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server gets a packet bigger
than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes, it issues a <CODE>Packet too
large</CODE> error and closes the connection.  With some clients, you may also
get <CODE>Lost connection to MySQL server during query</CODE> error if the
communication packet is too big.

</P>
<P>
Note that both the client and the server has it's own
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> variable. If you want to handle big packets,
you have to increase this variable both in the client and in the server.

</P>
<P>
It's safe to increase this variable as memory is only allocated when
needed; this variable is more a precaution to catch wrong packets
between the client/server and also to ensure that you don't accidentally
use big packets so that you run out of memory.

</P>
<P>
If you are using the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client, you may specify a bigger
buffer by starting the client with
<CODE>mysql --set-variable=max_allowed_packet=8M</CODE>.
Other clients have different methods to set this variable.
Please note that <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> is deprecated since
MySQL 4.0, just use <CODE>--max-allowed-packet=8M</CODE> instead.
 
You can use the option file to set <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to a larger
size in <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  For example, if you are expecting to store the
full length of a <CODE>MEDIUMBLOB</CODE> into a table, you'll need to start
the server with the <CODE>set-variable=max_allowed_packet=16M</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
You can also get strange problems with large packets if you are using
big blobs, but you haven't given <CODE>mysqld</CODE> access to enough memory
to handle the query.  If you suspect this is the case, try adding
<CODE>ulimit -d 256000</CODE> to the beginning of the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script
and restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

Other reasons for problems with Aborted clients / Aborted connections.

<UL>
<LI>

Usage of duplex Ethernet protocol, both half and full with
Linux. Many Linux Ethernet drivers have this bug. You should test
for this bug by transferring a huge file via ftp between these two
machines. If a transfer goes in burst-pause-burst-pause ... mode then
you are experiencing a Linux duplex syndrome. The only solution to
this problem is switching off either half or full duplex mode on hubs
and switches, and testing the results to decide on the best setting.
<LI>

Some problem with the thread library that causes interrupts on reads.
<LI>

Badly configured TCP/IP.
<LI>

Faulty Ethernets or hubs or switches, cables ... This can be diagnosed
properly only by replacing hardware.
<LI>

<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is too small or queries require more memory
than you have alloacated for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Packet_too_large">A.2.8  <CODE>Packet too large</CODE> Error</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Full_table" HREF="manual_toc.html#Full_table">A.2.10  <CODE>The table is full</CODE> Error</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1780"></A>

</P>
<P>
There is a couple of different cases when you can get this error:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You are using an older MySQL version (before 3.23.0) when an in-memory
temporary table becomes larger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE> bytes.
To avoid this problem, you can use the <CODE>-O tmp_table_size=#</CODE> option
to make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> increase the temporary table size or use the SQL
option <CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> before you issue the problematic query.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.

You can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--big-tables</CODE> option.
This is exactly the same as using <CODE>BIG_TABLES</CODE> for all queries.

In MySQL Version 3.23, in-memory temporary tables will automatically be
converted to a disk-based <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table after the table size gets
bigger than <CODE>tmp_table_size</CODE>.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables and run out of room in the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tablespace. In this case the solution is to extend the
<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tablespace.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>ISAM</CODE> or <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables on an OS that only
supports files of 2G in size and you have hit this limit for the data
or index file.
<LI>

You are using <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables and the needed data or index size is
bigger than what MySQL has allocated pointers for.  (If you don't specify
<CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> MySQL will only allocate pointers
to hold 4G of data).

You can check the maximum data/index sizes by doing

<PRE>
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM database LIKE 'table_name';
</PRE>

or using <CODE>myisamchk -dv database/table_name</CODE>.

If this is the problem, you can fix it by doing something like:

<PRE>
ALTER TABLE table_name MAX_ROWS=1000000000 AVG_ROW_LENGTH=nnn;
</PRE>

You only have to specify <CODE>AVG_ROW_LENGTH</CODE> for tables with BLOB/TEXT
fields as in this case MySQL can't optimise the space required based
only on the number of rows.

<P>
If you get an error for some queries of type:

</P>

<PRE>
Can't create/write to file '\\sqla3fe_0.ism'.

<P>
this means that MySQL can't create a temporary file for the

</P>
<P>
this means that when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> was started or when it reloaded the

an invalid password.  As a result, the entry is simply ignored by the

</P>
<P>
Possible causes of and fixes for this problem:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You may be running a new version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with an old
<CODE>user</CODE> table.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqlshow mysql user</CODE> to see if
the password field is shorter than 16 characters. If so, you can correct this
condition by running the <CODE>scripts/add_long_password</CODE> script.

<LI>

The user has an old password (8 characters long) and you didn't start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option.
Update the user in the <CODE>user</CODE> table with a new password or
restart <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--old-protocol</CODE>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1783"></A>
You have specified a password in the <CODE>user</CODE> table without using the

<P>
This means one of the following things:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The character set is a multi-byte character set and you have no support
for the character set in the client.

In this case you need to recompile the client with
<CODE>--with-charset=xxx</CODE> or with <CODE>--with-extra-charsets=xxx</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

All standard MySQL binaries are compiled with
<CODE>--with-extra-character-sets=complex</CODE> which will enable support for
all multi-byte character sets. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Character_sets">4.6.1  The Character Set Used for Data and Sorting</A>.

<LI>

The character set is a simple character set which is not compiled into
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> and the character set definition files are not in the place
where the client expects to find them.

In this case you need to:


<UL>
<LI>

Recompile the client with support for the character set.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.
<LI>

Specify to the client where the character set definition files are. For many
clients you can do this with the

File table overflow
shell&#62; perror 24
Too many open files
shell&#62; perror 11

</PRE>

<P>
The problem here is that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is trying to keep open too many
files simultaneously.  You can either tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to open so
many files at once or increase the number of file descriptors
available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To tell <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to keep open fewer files at a time, you can make
the table cache smaller by using the <CODE>-O table_cache=32</CODE> option to
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> (the default value is 64). Reducing the value of
<CODE>max_connections</CODE> will also reduce the number of open files (the
default value is 90).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1785"></A>
To change the number of file descriptors available to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you
can use the option <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or
<CODE>-O open-files-limit=#</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
The easiest way to do that is to add the option to your option file.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.  If you have an old <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version that
doesn't support this, you can edit the <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> script.  There
is a commented-out line <CODE>ulimit -n 256</CODE> in the script.  You can
remove the <CODE>'#'</CODE> character to uncomment this line, and change the
number 256 to affect the number of file descriptors available to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ulimit</CODE> (and <CODE>open-files-limit</CODE>) can increase the number of
file descriptors, but only up to the limit imposed by the operating
system. There is also a 'hard' limit that can only be overrided if you
start <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> or <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as root (just remember that
you need to also use the <CODE>--user=...</CODE> option in this case).  If you
need to increase the OS limit on the number of file descriptors
available to each process, consult the documentation for your operating
system.

</P>
<P>
Note that if you run the <CODE>tcsh</CODE> shell, <CODE>ulimit</CODE> will not work!
<CODE>tcsh</CODE> will also report incorrect values when you ask for the current

<P>
Another way to solve this problem is to link your program statically, with

<H3><A NAME="Changing_MySQL_user" HREF="manual_toc.html#Changing_MySQL_user">A.3.2  How to Run MySQL As a Normal User</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server <CODE>mysqld</CODE> can be started and run by any user.
In order to change <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to run as a Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, you must
do the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Stop the server if it's running (use <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).

<LI>

Change the database directories and files so that <CODE>user_name</CODE> has
privileges to read and write files in them (you may need to do this as
the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user):


<PRE>
shell&#62; chown -R user_name /path/to/mysql/datadir
</PRE>

If directories or files within the MySQL data directory are
symlinks, you'll also need to follow those links and change the directories
and files they point to.  <CODE>chown -R</CODE> may not follow symlinks for
you.

<LI>

Start the server as user <CODE>user_name</CODE>, or, if you are using
MySQL Version 3.22 or later, start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE>
user and use the <CODE>--user=user_name</CODE> option.  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will switch
to run as the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE> before accepting any connections.

<LI>

To start the server as the given user name automatically at system
startup time, add a <CODE>user</CODE> line that specifies the user name to
the <CODE>[mysqld]</CODE> group of the <TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT> option file or the
<TT>`my.cnf'</TT> option file in the server's data directory. For example:


<PRE>
[mysqld]
user=user_name
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
At this point, your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> process should be running fine and dandy as
the Unix user <CODE>user_name</CODE>. One thing hasn't changed, though: the
contents of the permissions tables. By default (right after running the
permissions table install script <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE>), the MySQL
user <CODE>root</CODE> is the only user with permission to access the <CODE>mysql</CODE>
database or to create or drop databases.  Unless you have changed those
permissions, they still hold. This shouldn't stop you from accessing
MySQL as the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> user when you're logged in
as a Unix user other than <CODE>root</CODE>; just specify the <CODE>-u root</CODE> option
to the client program.

<P>
Note that accessing MySQL as <CODE>root</CODE>, by supplying <CODE>-u
root</CODE> on the command-line, has <STRONG>nothing</STRONG> to do with MySQL running
as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user, or, indeed, as another Unix user. The access
permissions and user names of MySQL are completely separate from
Unix user names. The only connection with Unix user names is that if you
don't provide a <CODE>-u</CODE> option when you invoke a client program, the client
will try to connect using your Unix login name as your MySQL user
name.

</P>
<P>
If your Unix box itself isn't secured, you should probably at least put a
password on the MySQL <CODE>root</CODE> users in the access tables.
Otherwise, any user with an account on that machine can run <CODE>mysql -u
root db_name</CODE> and do whatever he likes.

If you have problems with file permissions, for example, if <CODE>mysql</CODE>
issues the following error message when you create a table:

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1794"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1795"></A>
then the environment variable <CODE>UMASK</CODE> might be set incorrectly when
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts up.  The default umask value is <CODE>0660</CODE>. You can
change this behaviour by starting <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK=384  # = 600 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1796"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1797"></A>
By default MySQL will create database and <CODE>RAID</CODE>
directories with permission type 0700.  You can modify this behaviour by
setting the <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> variable. If you set this, new
directories are created with the combined <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and
<CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE>. For example, if you want to give group access to
all new directories, you can do:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; UMASK_DIR=504  # = 770 in octal
shell&#62; export UMASK_DIR
shell&#62; /path/to/safe_mysqld &#38;
</PRE>

<P>
In MySQL Version 3.23.25 and above, MySQL assumes that the
value for <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> is in octal if it starts
with a zero.

<H3><A NAME="Crashing" HREF="manual_toc.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1798"></A>

</P>
<P>
All MySQL versions are tested on many platforms before they are
released.  This doesn't mean that there aren't any bugs in
MySQL, but it means if there are bugs, they are very few and can be
hard to find.  If you have a problem, it will always help if you try to
find out exactly what crashes your system, as you will have a much better
chance of getting this fixed quickly.

</P>
<P>
First, you should try to find out whether the problem is that the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon dies or whether your problem has to do with your
client.  You can check how long your <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server has been up by
executing <CODE>mysqladmin version</CODE>.  If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has died, you may
find the reason for this in the file
<TT>`mysql-data-directory/`hostname`.err'</TT>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
Many crashes of MySQL are caused by corrupted index / data
files.  MySQL will update the data on disk, with the
<CODE>write()</CODE> system call, after every SQL statement and before the
client is notified about the result. (This is not true if you are running
with <CODE>delay_key_write</CODE>, in which case only the data is written.)
This means that the data is safe even if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes, as the OS will
ensure that the not flushed data is written to disk.  You can force
MySQL to sync everything to disk after every SQL command by
starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--flush</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The above means that normally you shouldn't get corrupted tables unless:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Someone/something killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> or the machine in the middle
of an update.
<LI>

You have found a bug in <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that caused it to die in the
middle of an update.
<LI>

Someone is manipulating the data/index files outside of <STRONG>mysqld</STRONG>
without locking the table properly.
<LI>

If you are running many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same data on a
system that doesn't support good filesystem locks (normally handled by
the <CODE>lockd</CODE> daemon ) or if you are running
multiple servers with <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE>
<LI>

You have a crashed index/datafile that contains very wrong data that
got <CODE>mysqld</CODE> confused.
<LI>

You have found a bug in the data storage code. This isn't that likely,
but it's at least possible.  In this case you can try to change the file
type to another storage engine by using <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on a
repaired copy of the table!
</UL>

<P>
Because it is very difficult to know why something is crashing, first try to
check whether things that work for others crash for you.  Please try
the following things:

</P>

<UL>
Take down the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>, run
<CODE>myisamchk --silent --force */*.MYI</CODE> on all tables, and restart the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon.  This will ensure that you are running from a clean
state.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

<LI>

Use <CODE>mysqld --log</CODE> and try to determine from the information in the log
whether some specific query kills the server. About 95% of all bugs are
related to a particular query!  Normally this is one of the last queries in
the log file just before MySQL restarted. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_log">4.9.2  The General Query Log</A>.
If you can repeatadly kill MySQL with one of the queries, even
when you have checked all tables just before doing the query, then you
have been able to locate the bug and should do a bug report for this!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

<LI>

Try to make a test case that we can use to reproduce the problem.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case When You Experience Table Corruption</A>.

<LI>

Try running the included mysql-test test and the MySQL
benchmarks.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_test_suite">9.1.2  MySQL Test Suite</A>.  They should test MySQL
rather well.  You can also add code that to the benchmarks to simulates
your application!  The benchmarks can be found in the <TT>`bench'</TT>
directory in the source distribution or, for a binary distribution, in
the <TT>`sql-bench'</TT> directory under your MySQL installation
directory.

<LI>

Try <CODE>fork_test.pl</CODE> and <CODE>fork2_test.pl</CODE>.

<LI>

If you configure MySQL for debugging, it will be much easier to
gather information about possible errors if something goes wrong.
Reconfigure MySQL with the <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> option or
<CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> to <CODE>configure</CODE> and then recompile.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

<LI>

Configuring MySQL for debugging causes a safe memory allocator to be
included that can find some errors. It also provides a lot of output about
what is happening.

<LI>

Have you applied the latest patches for your operating system?

<LI>

Use the <CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  On some
systems, the <CODE>lockd</CODE> lock manager does not work properly; the
<CODE>--skip-external-locking</CODE> option tells <CODE>mysqld</CODE> not to use external
locking.  (This means that you cannot run 2 <CODE>mysqld</CODE> servers on the same
data and that you must be careful if you use <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, but it may be
instructive to try the option as a test.)

<LI>

Have you tried <CODE>mysqladmin -u root processlist</CODE> when <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
appears to be running but not responding?  Sometimes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is not
comatose even though you might think so.  The problem may be that all
connections are in use, or there may be some internal lock problem.
<CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> will usually be able to make a connection even
in these cases, and can provide useful information about the current number
of connections and their status.

<LI>

Run the command <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5 status</CODE> or <CODE>mysqladmin -i 5
-r status</CODE> or in a separate window to produce statistics while you run
your other queries.

<LI>

Try the following:

<OL>
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from <CODE>gdb</CODE> (or in another debugger).
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Using_gdb_on_mysqld">E.1.3  Debugging mysqld under gdb</A>.

<LI>

Run your test scripts.

<LI>

Print the backtrace and the local variables at the 3 lowest levels. In gdb you
can do this with the following commands when <CODE>mysqld</CODE> has crashed inside
gdb:


<PRE>
backtrace
info local
up
info local
up
info local
</PRE>

With gdb you can also examine which threads exist with <CODE>info
threads</CODE> and switch to a specific thread with <CODE>thread #</CODE>, where
<CODE>#</CODE> is the thread id.
</OL>

<LI>

Try to simulate your application with a Perl script to force
MySQL to crash or misbehave.

<LI>

Send a normal bug report. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>. Be even more detailed
than usual.  Because MySQL works for many people, it may be that the
crash results from something that exists only on your computer (for example,
an error that is related to your particular system libraries).
<LI>

If you have a problem with tables with dynamic-length rows and you are
not using <CODE>BLOB/TEXT</CODE> columns (but only <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> columns), you
can try to change all <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> to <CODE>CHAR</CODE> with <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE>.  This will force MySQL to use fixed-size rows.
Fixed-size rows take a little extra space, but are much more tolerant to
corruption!

The current dynamic row code has been in use at MySQL AB for at
least 3 years without any problems, but by nature dynamic-length rows are
more prone to errors, so it may be a good idea to try the above to see if
it helps!

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1802"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1803"></A>

</P>
<P>
When a disk-full condition occurs, MySQL does the following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

It checks once every minute to see whether there is enough space to
write the current row. If there is enough space, it continues as if nothing had
happened.
<LI>

Every 6 minutes it writes an entry to the log file warning about the disk
full condition.
</UL>

<P>
To alleviate the problem, you can take the following actions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

To continue, you only have to free enough disk space to insert all records.
<LI>

To abort the thread, you must send a <CODE>mysqladmin kill</CODE> to the thread.
The thread will be aborted the next time it checks the disk (in 1 minute).
<LI>

Note that other threads may be waiting for the table that caused the disk
full condition.  If you have several ``locked'' threads, killing the one
thread that is waiting on the disk-full condition will allow the other
threads to continue.
</UL>

<P>
Exceptions to the above behaveour is when you use <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> or
<CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE> or when the indexes are created in a batch after an
<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> or after an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> statement.

</P>
<P>
All of the above commands may use big temporary files that left to
themself would cause big problems for the rest of the system.  If
MySQL gets disk full while doing any of the above operations,
it will remove the big temporary files and mark the table as crashed
(except for <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, in which the old table will be left
unchanged).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Temporary_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Temporary_files">A.4.4  Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files</A></H3>

<P>
MySQL uses the value of the <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> environment variable as
the pathname of the directory in which to store temporary files.  If you don't
have <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> set, MySQL uses the system default, which is
normally <TT>`/tmp'</TT> or <TT>`/usr/tmp'</TT>.  If the filesystem containing your
temporary file directory is too small, you should edit <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> to
set <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> to point to a directory in a filesystem where you have
enough space!  You can also set the temporary directory using the
<CODE>--tmpdir</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
MySQL creates all temporary files as hidden files. This ensures
that the temporary files will be removed if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is terminated.  The
disadvantage of using hidden files is that you will not see a big temporary
file that fills up the filesystem in which the temporary file directory is
located.

</P>
<P>
When sorting (<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>), MySQL normally
uses one or two temporary files. The maximum disk-space needed is:

</P>

<PRE>
(length of what is sorted + sizeof(database pointer))
* number of matched rows
* 2
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>sizeof(database pointer)</CODE> is usually 4, but may grow in the future for
really big tables.

</P>
<P>
For some <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries, MySQL also creates temporary SQL
tables. These are not hidden and have names of the form <TT>`SQL_*'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> creates a temporary table in the same directory as
the original table.

</P>
<P>
If you use MySQL 4.1 or later you can spread load between
several physical disks by setting <CODE>--tmpdir</CODE> to a list of paths
separated by colon <CODE>:</CODE> (semicolon <CODE>;</CODE> on Windows). They
will be used in round-robin fashion.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> These paths should end up on different <STRONG>physical</STRONG> disks,
not different partitions of the same disk.

If you have problems with the fact that anyone can delete the

</P>
<P>
By default, MySQL searches are case-insensitive (although there are
some character sets that are never case-insensitive, such as <CODE>czech</CODE>).
That means that if you search with <CODE>col_name LIKE 'a%'</CODE>, you will get all
column values that start with <CODE>A</CODE> or <CODE>a</CODE>. If you want to make this
search case-sensitive, use something like <CODE>INSTR(col_name, "A")=1</CODE> to
check a prefix. Or use <CODE>STRCMP(col_name, "A") = 0</CODE> if the column value
must be exactly <CODE>"A"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Simple comparison operations (<CODE>&#62;=, &#62;, = , &#60; , &#60;=</CODE>, sorting and
grouping) are based on each character's ``sort value''. Characters with
the same sort value (like E, e and é) are treated as the same character!

</P>
<P>
In older MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> comparisons where done on
the uppercase value of each character (E == e but E &#60;&#62; é).  In newer
MySQL versions <CODE>LIKE</CODE> works just like the other comparison
operators.

</P>
<P>
If you want a column always to be treated in case-sensitive fashion,
declare it as <CODE>BINARY</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#CREATE_TABLE">6.5.3  <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using Chinese data in the so-called big5 encoding, you want to
make all character columns <CODE>BINARY</CODE>. This works because the sorting
order of big5 encoding characters is based on the order of ASCII codes.

The format of a <CODE>DATE</CODE> value is <CODE>'YYYY-MM-DD'</CODE>. According to ANSI
SQL, no other format is allowed. You should use this format in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
expressions and in the WHERE clause of <CODE>SELECT</CODE> statements.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE date &#62;= '1997-05-05';
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience, MySQL automatically converts a date to a number if
the date is used in a numeric context (and vice versa). It is also smart
enough to allow a ``relaxed'' string form when updating and in a <CODE>WHERE</CODE>
clause that compares a date to a <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, or a
<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> column.  (Relaxed form means that any punctuation character
may be used as the separator between parts. For example, <CODE>'1998-08-15'</CODE>
and <CODE>'1998#08#15'</CODE> are equivalent.) MySQL can also convert a
string containing no separators (such as <CODE>'19980815'</CODE>), provided it
makes sense as a date.

</P>
<P>
The special date <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> can be stored and retrieved as
<CODE>'0000-00-00'.</CODE> When using a <CODE>'0000-00-00'</CODE> date through
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE>, it will automatically be converted to <CODE>NULL</CODE> in
<CODE>MyODBC</CODE> Version 2.50.12 and above, because ODBC can't handle this kind of
date.

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL performs the conversions described above, the following
statements work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES (19970505);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('19970505');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('97-05-05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997.05.05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('1997 05 05');
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO tbl_name (idate) VALUES ('0000-00-00');

mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '1997-05-05';
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT MOD(idate,100) FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= 19970505;
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE idate &#62;= '19970505';
</PRE>

<P>
However, the following will not work:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT idate FROM tbl_name WHERE STRCMP(idate,'19970505')=0;
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>STRCMP()</CODE> is a string function, so it converts <CODE>idate</CODE> to
a string and performs a string comparison.  It does not convert
<CODE>'19970505'</CODE> to a date and perform a date comparison.

</P>
<P>
Note that MySQL does very limited checking whether the date is
correct.  If you store an incorrect date, such as <CODE>'1998-2-31'</CODE>, the
wrong date will be stored.

</P>
<P>
Because MySQL packs dates for storage, it can't store any given date as
it would not fit onto the result buffer. The rules for accepting a date
are:

<UL>
<LI>

If MySQL can store and retrieve a given date, the wrong date is accepted
for <CODE>DATE</CODE> and <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> columns.
<LI>

All days values between 0-31 are accepted for any date.  This makes it
very convenient for web applications where you ask year, month and day
in 3 different fields.
<LI>

The day or month field may be zero.  This is convenient if you want
to store a birthdate in a <CODE>DATE</CODE> column and you only know part
of the date.
</UL>

<P>
If the date cannot be converted to any reasonable value, a <CODE>0</CODE> is
stored in the <CODE>DATE</CODE> field, which will be retrieved as
<CODE>0000-00-00</CODE>.  This is both a speed and convenience issue as we
believe that the database's responsiblity is to retrieve the same date
you stored (even if the data was not logically correct in all cases).
We think it is up to the application to check the dates, and not the server.

<P>
The concept of the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is a common source of confusion for
newcomers to SQL, who often think that <CODE>NULL</CODE> is the same thing as an
empty string <CODE>""</CODE>.  This is not the case! For example, the following
statements are completely different:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES (NULL);
mysql&#62; INSERT INTO my_table (phone) VALUES ("");
</PRE>

<P>
Both statements insert a value into the <CODE>phone</CODE> column, but the first
inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value and the second inserts an empty string.  The
meaning of the first can be regarded as ``phone number is not known'' and the
meaning of the second can be regarded as ``she has no phone''.

</P>
<P>
In SQL, the <CODE>NULL</CODE> value is always false in comparison to any
other value, even <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  An expression that contains <CODE>NULL</CODE>
always produces a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value unless otherwise indicated in
the documentation for the operators and functions involved in the
expression. All columns in the following example return <CODE>NULL</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT NULL,1+NULL,CONCAT('Invisible',NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to search for column values that are <CODE>NULL</CODE>, you
cannot use the <CODE>=NULL</CODE> test. The following statement returns no
rows, because <CODE>expr = NULL</CODE> is FALSE, for any expression:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
To look for <CODE>NULL</CODE> values, you must use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> test.
The following shows how to find the <CODE>NULL</CODE> phone number and the
empty phone number:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone IS NULL;
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE phone = "";
</PRE>

<P>
Note that you can only add an index on a column that can have <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values if you are using MySQL Version 3.23.2 or newer and are using the
<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> or <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table type.
In earlier versions and with other table types, you must declare such
columns <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>. This also means you cannot then insert
<CODE>NULL</CODE> into an indexed column.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1820"></A>
When reading data with <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE>, empty columns are updated
with <CODE>''</CODE>. If you want a <CODE>NULL</CODE> value in a column, you should use
<CODE>\N</CODE> in the text file. The literal word <CODE>'NULL'</CODE> may also be used
under some circumstances.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#LOAD_DATA">6.4.9  <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented first.
In versions prior to 4.0.2, if you sort in descending order using
<CODE>DESC</CODE>, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are presented last.
When using <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>, all <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are regarded as equal.

</P>
<P>
To help with <CODE>NULL</CODE> handling, you can use the <CODE>IS NULL</CODE> and
<CODE>IS NOT NULL</CODE> operators and the <CODE>IFNULL()</CODE> function.

<A NAME="IDX1822"></A>

For some column types, <CODE>NULL</CODE> values are handled specially.  If you
insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into the first <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> column of a table, the
current date and time is inserted.  If you insert <CODE>NULL</CODE> into an
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column, the next number in the sequence is inserted.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Problems_with_alias" HREF="manual_toc.html#Problems_with_alias">A.5.4  Problems with <CODE>alias</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1825"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can use an alias to refer to a column in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>,
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>, or in the <CODE>HAVING</CODE> part.  Aliases can also be used
to give columns better names:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT SQRT(a*b) as rt FROM table_name GROUP BY rt HAVING rt &#62; 0;
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name GROUP BY id HAVING cnt &#62; 0;
SELECT id AS "Customer identity" FROM table_name;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that ANSI SQL doesn't allow you to refer to an alias in a
<CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.  This is because when the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> code is
executed the column value may not yet be determined. For example, the
following query is <STRONG>illegal</STRONG>:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT id,COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM table_name WHERE cnt &#62; 0 GROUP BY id;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>WHERE</CODE> statement is executed to determine which rows should
be included in the <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> part while <CODE>HAVING</CODE> is used to
decide which rows from the result set should be used.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Deleting_from_related_tables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Deleting_from_related_tables">A.5.5  Deleting Rows from Related Tables</A></H3>

</P>
<P>
As MySQL doesn't support subqueries (prior to Version 4.1), nor the use of more
than one table in the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statement (prior to Version 4.0), you
should use the following approach to delete rows from 2 related tables:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> the rows based on some <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition in the main table.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE</CODE> the rows in the main table based on the same condition.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM related_table WHERE related_column IN (selected_rows)</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
If the total number of characters in the query with
<CODE>related_column</CODE> is more than 1,048,576 (the default value of
<CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE>, you should split it into smaller parts and
execute multiple <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements.  You will probably get the
fastest <CODE>DELETE</CODE> by only deleting 100-1000 <CODE>related_column</CODE>
id's per query if the <CODE>related_column</CODE> is an index.  If the
<CODE>related_column</CODE> isn't an index, the speed is independent of the
number of arguments in the <CODE>IN</CODE> clause.

If you have a complicated query that has many tables and that doesn't
return any rows, you should use the following procedure to find out what
is wrong with your query:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Test the query with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> and check if you can find something that is
obviously wrong. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

<LI>

Select only those fields that are used in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.

<LI>

Remove one table at a time from the query until it returns some rows.
If the tables are big, it's a good idea to use <CODE>LIMIT 10</CODE> with the query.

<LI>

Do a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> for the column that should have matched a row against
the table that was last removed from the query.

<LI>

If you are comparing <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> or <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> columns with numbers that
have decimals, you can't use <CODE>'='</CODE>. This problem is common in most
computer languages because floating-point values are not exact values.
In most cases, changing the <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> to a <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> will fix this.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Problems_with_float">A.5.7  Problems with Floating-Point Comparison</A>.

<LI>

If you still can't figure out what's wrong, create a minimal test that can
be run with <CODE>mysql test &#60; query.sql</CODE> that shows your problems.
You can create a test file with <CODE>mysqldump --quick database tables &#62; query.sql</CODE>. Open the file in an editor, remove some insert lines (if there are
too many of these), and add your select statement at the end of the file.

Test that you still have your problem by doing:


<PRE>
shell&#62; mysqladmin create test2
shell&#62; mysql test2 &#60; query.sql
</PRE>

Post the test file using <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> to <a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.

floating-point numbers cause confusion sometimes, because these numbers

CREATE TABLE t1 (i INT, d1 DECIMAL(9,2), d2 DECIMAL(9,2));

</PRE>

<P>
The result is correct. Although the first five records look like they
shouldn't pass the comparison test, they may do so because the
difference between the numbers show up around tenth decimal, or so
depending on computer architecture.

</P>
<P>
The problem cannot be solved by using ROUND() (or similar function),
because the result is still a floating-point number. Example:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2) AS a, ROUND(SUM(d2), 2) AS b
    -&#62; FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a &#60;&#62; b;

This is what the numbers in column 'a' look like:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2)*1.0000000000000000 AS a,
    -&#62; ROUND(SUM(d2), 2) AS b FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a &#60;&#62; b;

<P>
Depending on the computer architecture you may or may not see similar results.
Each CPU may evaluate floating-point numbers differently. For example in
some machines you may get 'right' results by multiplaying both arguments
with 1, an example follows.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>WARNING: NEVER TRUST THIS METHOD IN YOUR APPLICATION, THIS IS
AN EXAMPLE OF A WRONG METHOD!!!</STRONG>

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, ROUND(SUM(d1), 2)*1 AS a, ROUND(SUM(d2), 2)*1 AS b
    -&#62; FROM t1 GROUP BY i HAVING a &#60;&#62; b;
+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
</PRE>

<P>
The reason why the above example seems to be working is that on the
particular machine where the test was done, the CPU floating-point
arithmetics happens to round the numbers to same, but there is no
rule that any CPU should do so, so it cannot be trusted.

</P>
<P>
The correct way to do floating-point number comparison is to first
decide on what is the wanted tolerance between the numbers and then do
the comparsion against the tolerance number. For example, if we agree on
that floating-point numbers should be regarded the same, if they are
same with precision of one of ten thousand (0.0001), the comparsion
should be done like this:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -&#62; GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) &#62; 0.0001;
+------+--------+------+
| i    | a      | b    |
+------+--------+------+
|    6 | -51.40 | 0.00 |
+------+--------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>

<P>
And vice versa, if we wanted to get rows where the numbers are the same,
the test would be:

</P>

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT i, SUM(d1) AS a, SUM(d2) AS b FROM t1
    -&#62; GROUP BY i HAVING ABS(a - b) &#60; 0.0001;
+------+-------+-------+
| i    | a     | b     |
+------+-------+-------+
|    1 | 21.40 | 21.40 |
|    2 | 76.80 | 76.80 |
|    3 |  7.40 |  7.40 |
|    4 | 15.40 | 15.40 |

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> changes a table to the current character set.
If you get a duplicate key error during <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, then the cause
is either that the new character sets maps two keys to the same value
or that the table is corrupted, in which case you should run
<CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> on the table.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> dies with an error like this:

</P>

<PRE>
Error on rename of './database/name.frm' to './database/B-a.frm' (Errcode: 17)
</PRE>

<P>
the problem may be that MySQL has crashed in a previous <CODE>ALTER
TABLE</CODE> and there is an old table named <TT>`A-something'</TT> or
<TT>`B-something'</TT> lying around.  In this case, go to the MySQL data
directory and delete all files that have names starting with <CODE>A-</CODE> or
<CODE>B-</CODE>.  (You may want to move them elsewhere instead of deleting them.)

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> works the following way:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Create a new table named <TT>`A-xxx'</TT> with the requested changes.

<LI>All rows from the old table are copied to <TT>`A-xxx'</TT>.

<LI>The old table is renamed <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>.

<LI><TT>`A-xxx'</TT> is renamed to your old table name.

<LI><TT>`B-xxx'</TT> is deleted.

</UL>

<P>
If something goes wrong with the renaming operation, MySQL tries to
undo the changes.  If something goes seriously wrong (this shouldn't happen,
of course), MySQL may leave the old table as <TT>`B-xxx'</TT>, but a
simple rename on the system level should get your data back.

The whole point of SQL is to abstract the application from the data
storage format.  You should always specify the order in which you wish to
retrieve your data.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT col_name1, col_name2, col_name3 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
will return columns in the order <CODE>col_name1</CODE>, <CODE>col_name2</CODE>, <CODE>col_name3</CODE>, whereas:

</P>

<PRE>
SELECT col_name1, col_name3, col_name2 FROM tbl_name;
</PRE>

<P>
will return columns in the order <CODE>col_name1</CODE>, <CODE>col_name3</CODE>, <CODE>col_name2</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you want to change the order of columns anyway, you can do it as follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Create a new table with the columns in the right order.
<LI>

Execute
<CODE>INSERT INTO new_table SELECT fields-in-new_table-order FROM old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

Drop or rename <CODE>old_table</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME old_table</CODE>.
</OL>

<P>
You should <STRONG>never</STRONG>, in an application, use <CODE>SELECT *</CODE> and
retrieve the columns based on their position, because the order and
position in which columns are returned <STRONG>cannot</STRONG> may not remain
the same (if you add/move/delete columns). A simple change to your
database structure would then cause your application to fail.
Of course <CODE>SELECT *</CODE> is quite suitable for testing queries.

inserted into a new table. An example is when you want to create a new
table for a different site you are working on, but the table is just a

While <CODE>MySQL AB</CODE> owns all copyrights in the <CODE>MySQL server</CODE>

contributions of one kind or another to the <CODE>MySQL distribution</CODE>.
Contributors are listed here, in somewhat random order:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Paul DuBois
<DD>
Ongoing help with making this manual correct and understandable.
That includes rewriting Monty's and David's attempts at English into
English as other people know it.
<DT>Gianmassimo Vigazzola <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@mbox.vol.it">qwerg@mbox.vol.it</a> or <a HREF="mailto:qwerg@tin.it">qwerg@tin.it</a>
<DD>
The initial port to Win32/NT.
<DT>Kim Aldale
<DD>
Helped to rewrite Monty's and David's early attempts at English into
English.
<DT>Per Eric Olsson
<DD>
For more or less constructive criticism and real testing of the dynamic
record format.
<DT>Irena Pancirov <a HREF="mailto:irena@mail.yacc.it">irena@mail.yacc.it</a>
<DD>
Win32 port with Borland compiler.  <CODE>mysqlshutdown.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>mysqlwatch.exe</CODE>
<DT>David J. Hughes
<DD>
For the effort to make a shareware SQL database. At TcX, the predecessor
of MySQL AB, we started with <CODE>mSQL</CODE>, but found that it couldn't
satisfy our purposes so instead we wrote a SQL interface to our
application builder Unireg.  <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE> and <CODE>mysql</CODE> client are
programs that were largely influenced by their <CODE>mSQL</CODE> counterparts.
We have put a lot of effort into making the MySQL syntax a superset of
<CODE>mSQL</CODE>. Many of the API's ideas are borrowed from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to
make it easy to port free <CODE>mSQL</CODE> programs to the MySQL API.
The MySQL software doesn't contain any code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE>.
Two files in the distribution (<TT>`client/insert_test.c'</TT> and
<TT>`client/select_test.c'</TT>) are based on the corresponding (non-copyrighted)
files in the <CODE>mSQL</CODE> distribution, but are modified as examples showing
the changes necessary to convert code from <CODE>mSQL</CODE> to MySQL Server.
(<CODE>mSQL</CODE> is copyrighted David J. Hughes.)
<DT>Fred Fish
<DD>
For his excellent C debugging and trace library. Monty has made a number
of smaller improvements to the library (speed and additional options).
<DT>Richard A. O'Keefe
<DD>
For his public domain string library.
<DT>Henry Spencer
<DD>
For his regex library, used in <CODE>WHERE column REGEXP regexp</CODE>.
<DT>Free Software Foundation
<DD>
From whom we got an excellent compiler (<CODE>gcc</CODE>), the <CODE>libc</CODE> library
(from which we have borrowed <TT>`strto.c'</TT> to get some code working in Linux),
and the <CODE>readline</CODE> library (for the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client).
<DT>Free Software Foundation &#38; The XEmacs development team

</P>
<P>
This appendix lists the changes from version to version in the MySQL
source code.

</P>
<P>
We are now working actively on MySQL 4.1 &#38; 5.0 and will only provide
critical bug fixes for MySQL 4.0 and MySQL 3.23.  We update this section
as we add new features, so that everybody can follow the development.

</P>
<P>
Our TODO section contains what further plans we have for 4.1 &#38;
5.0. See section <A HREF="manual.html#TODO">1.8  MySQL and The Future (The TODO)</A>.

</P>
<P>
Note that we tend to update the manual at the same time we make changes to
MySQL.  If you find a version listed here that you can't
find on the MySQL download page (<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</a>),
this means that the version has not yet been released!

</P>



<H2><A NAME="News-5.0.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-5.0.x">D.1  Changes in release 5.0.0 (Development)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1853"></A>

</P>
<P>
Version 5.0 is for the moment only available on for MySQL developers.
It will be publicly available as soon we are confident that the base
for stored procedures is sound and working.

</P>
<P>
The following changelog shows what is already done in the 5.0 tree:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Some support for stored procedures (ANSI SQL 99 style).
<LI>

connecting to <CODE>localhost</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>REPAIR of MyISAM tables now uses less temporary disk space when
sorting char columns</CODE>.

supported anymore; One must either have separators between each
<CODE>DATE</CODE>/<CODE>TIME</CODE> part or not at all.
<LI>

Server side help for all MySQL functions. One can now type <CODE>help
week</CODE> in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client and get help for the <CODE>week()</CODE>
function.

<LI>

Fixed bug in libmysqlclient that fetched field defaults
<LI>

Fixed bug in <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT> client when skipping comments

<A NAME="IDX1855"></A>

</P>
<P>
Version 4.0 of the MySQL server includes many enhancements and new features:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table type is now included in the standard binaries,
adding transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>.
<LI>

A query cache, offering vastly increased performance for many applications.
By caching complete result sets, later identical queries can return
instantly.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Query_Cache">6.9  MySQL Query Cache</A>.
<LI>

Improved full-text indexing with boolean mode, truncation, and phrase searching.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Fulltext_Search">6.8  MySQL Full-text Search</A>.
<LI>

Enhanced <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables, now supporting <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s and
<CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.
<LI>

<CODE>UNION</CODE> syntax in <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#UNION">6.4.1.2  <CODE>UNION</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE> statements.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#DELETE">6.4.6  <CODE>DELETE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

<CODE>libmysqld</CODE>, the embedded server library.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#libmysqld">8.4.9  libmysqld, the Embedded MySQL Server Library</A>.
<LI>

Additional <CODE>GRANT</CODE> privilege options for even tighter control and
security.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#GRANT">4.3.1  <CODE>GRANT</CODE> and <CODE>REVOKE</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Management of user resources in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> system, particularly
useful for ISPs and other hosting providers.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#User_resources">4.3.6  Limiting user resources</A>.
<LI>

Dynamic server variables, allowing configuration changes without having
to take down the server.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SET_OPTION">5.5.6  <CODE>SET</CODE> Syntax</A>.
<LI>

Improved replication code and features.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Replication">4.10  Replication in MySQL</A>.

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<TT>`mysqld'</TT> no longer reads options from world-writeable config files.
<LI>

Integer values between 9223372036854775807 and 9999999999999999999 are now
regarded as unsigned longlongs, not as floats. This makes these values work
similar to values between 10000000000000000000 and 18446744073709551615.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> will now include the client TCP port after the
hostname to make it easier to know from which client the request
originated.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed <TT>`mysqld'</TT> crash on extremely small values of
<CODE>sort_buffer</CODE> variable.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO u SELECT ... FROM t</CODE> was written too late to the
binary log if t was very frequently updated during the execution of 
this query. This could cause a problem with <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> or
replication. The master must be upgraded, not the slave. (bug #136).
<LI>

Fixed checking of random part of <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause (bug #142).
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>multi-table updates</CODE> with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
tables. This bug occured as, in many cases, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables can not
be updated "on the fly", but offsets to the records have to be stored in
a temporary table. 
<LI>

Added missing file <TT>`mysql_secure_installation'</TT> to the <CODE>server</CODE>
RPM subpackage (bug #141).
<LI>

Fixed MySQL (and <TT>`myisamchk'</TT>) crash on artificially
corrupted <CODE>.MYI</CODE> files.
<LI>

Don't allow <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> to overwrite existing files.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with multi-table <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>s when user had all privileges
on the database where tables are located and there were any entries in
<CODE>tables_priv</CODE> table, i.e. <CODE>grant_option</CODE> was true.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that allowed a user with table or column grants on some table,
<CODE>TRUNCATE</CODE> any table in the same database.
<LI>

Fixed deadlock when doing <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> followed by <CODE>DROP
TABLE</CODE> in the same thread.  In this case one could still kill the thread
with <CODE>KILL</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> was not properly written to the binary
log (hence not properly replicated). (bug #82).
<LI>

<CODE>RAND()</CODE> entries were not read correctly by <CODE>mysqlbinlog</CODE> from
the binary log which caused problems when restoring a table that was
inserted with <CODE>RAND()</CODE>. <CODE>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(RAND())</CODE>. In
replication this worked ok.
<LI>

<CODE>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</CODE> was ignored for <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
queries. (bug #104).
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> reported too old positions
(columns <CODE>Relay_Master_Log_File</CODE> and <CODE>Exec_master_log_pos</CODE>)
for the last executed statement from the master, if this statement
was the <CODE>COMMIT</CODE> of a transaction. The master must be upgraded for that,
not the slave. (bug #52).
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> was not replicated by the slave if
<CODE>replicate_*_table</CODE> was set on the slave. (bug #86).
<LI>

After <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>, the coordinates displayed by <CODE>SHOW
SLAVE STATUS</CODE> looked un-reset (though they were, but only
internally). (bug #70).
<LI>

Fixed query cache invalidation on <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed memory leak on <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> procedure with error.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns that could cause wrong
results from the query.
<LI>

Fixed rare bug with wrong initialization of <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column,
as a secondary column in a multi-column key (see section <A HREF="manual.html#example-AUTO_INCREMENT">3.5.9  Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE></A>), when
data was inserted with <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> or <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> into
an empty table.
<LI>

On windows, <CODE>STOP SLAVE</CODE> didn't stop the slave until the slave
got one new command from the master (this bug has been fixed for MySQL 4.0.11
by releasing updated 4.0.11a windows packages, which include this individual
fix on top of the 4.0.11 sources). (bug #69).
<LI>

Fixed a crash when no database was selected and <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> command
was issued with full table name specified, including database prefix.
<LI>

Fixed a crash when shutting down replication on some platforms
(e.g. Mac OS X).
<LI>

Fixed a portability bug with <CODE>pthread_attr_getstacksize</CODE> on
HP-UX 10.20 (Patch was also included in 4.0.11a sources).
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>bigint</CODE> test to not fail on some platforms (e.g. HP-UX and
Tru64) due to different return values of the <CODE>atof()</CODE> function.
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>rpl_rotate_logs</CODE> test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed <CODE>slave-master-info.opt</CODE>
to <CODE>.slave-mi</CODE>).

<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.11" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.11">D.3.2  Changes in release 4.0.11 (20 Feb 2003)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>NULL</CODE> is now sorted <STRONG>LAST</STRONG> if you use <CODE>ORDER BY ... DESC</CODE>
(as it was before before MySQL 4.0.2).  This is change was required to
follow ANSI SQL 99.  (The original change was because we thought that
ANSI SQL 99 required NULL to be always sorted at the same position, but
this was wrong).
<LI>

Added <CODE>START TRANSACTION</CODE> (ANSI SQL-99 syntax) as alias for <CODE>BEGIN</CODE>.
This is recommended to use instead of <CODE>BEGIN</CODE> to start a transaction.
<LI>

Added <CODE>OLD_PASSWORD()</CODE> as a synonym for <CODE>PASSWORD()</CODE>.
<LI>

Allow keyword <CODE>ALL</CODE> in group functions.
<LI>

Added support for some new <CODE>INNER JOIN</CODE> and <CODE>JOIN</CODE> syntaxes.
For example, <CODE>SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2</CODE> didn't work before.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>multi-table-delete</CODE> and InnoDB tables.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>BLOB NOT NULL</CODE> columns used with <CODE>IS NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Re-added missing pre- and post(un)install scripts to the Linux RPM packages
(they were missing after the renaming of the server subpackage).
<LI>

Fixed that table locks are not released with multi-table updates and 
deletes with InnoDB storage engine.
<LI>

Fixed bug in updating BLOB columns with long strings.
<LI>

Fixed integer-wraparound when giving big integer (&#62;= 10 digits) to
function that requires an unsigned argument, like <CODE>CREATE TABLE (...) 
AUTO_INCREMENT=#</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> could in some cases return <CODE>NULL</CODE> on a column
with <CODE>NULL</CODE> and other values.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(key_column)</CODE> could in some cases
return wrong values when used in <CODE>OUTER JOIN</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>MIN(key_column)</CODE> and <CODE>MAX(key_column)</CODE> could return wrong
values if one of the tables was empty.
<LI>

Fixed rare crash in compressed MyISAM tables with blobs.
<LI>

Fixed bug in using aggregate functions as argument for <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>,
<CODE>CASE</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD</CODE>, <CODE>CONCAT_WS</CODE>, <CODE>ELT</CODE> and
<CODE>MAKE_SET</CODE> functions.
<LI>

When running with <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> (default on windows)
and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
executing <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> followed with <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>
or <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> could fail with <CODE>Errcode 13</CODE>.

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

Added option <CODE>--log-error[=file_name]</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> and
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. This option will force all error messages to be put in a
log file if the option <CODE>--console</CODE> is not given. On Windows
<CODE>--log-error</CODE> is enabled as default.
<LI>

Changed some things from <CODE>Warning:</CODE> to <CODE>Note:</CODE> in the log files.
<LI>

The mysqld server should now compile on Netware.
<LI>

Added optimisation that if one does <CODE>GROUP BY ... ORDER BY NULL</CODE>
then result is not sorted.
<LI>

New command-line option for <TT>`mysqld'</TT> to replace/disable
built-in stopword list, that is used in fulltext search.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>.
<LI>

Changed default stack size from 64K to 192K; This fixes a core dump
problem on RedHat 8.0 and other systems with a glibc that requires &#62; 128K
stack for <CODE>gethostbyaddr()</CODE> to resolve a hostname. You can fix
this for earlier MySQL versions by starting mysqld with
<CODE>--thread-stack=192K</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>mysql_waitpid</CODE> to the binary distribution and the
<CODE>MySQL-client</CODE> RPM subpackage (required for <CODE>mysql-test-run</CODE>).
<LI>

Renamed the main <CODE>MySQL</CODE> RPM package to <CODE>MySQL-server</CODE>. When
updating from an older version, <CODE>MySQL-server.rpm</CODE> will simply replace
<CODE>MySQL.rpm</CODE>.
<LI>

If a slave is configured with <CODE>replicate_wild_do_table=db.%</CODE> or
<CODE>replicate_wild_ignore_table=db.%</CODE>, these rules will be applied to
<CODE>CREATE/DROP DATABASE</CODE> too.
<LI>

Added timeout value for <CODE>MASTER_POS_WAIT()</CODE>.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed initialization of the random seed for newly created threads to
give a better <CODE>rand()</CODE> distribution from the first call.
<LI>

Fixed a bug that caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to hang when a
table was opened with the <CODE>HANDLER</CODE> command and then
dropped without being closed.
<LI>

Fixed bug in logging to binary log (which affects replication) a query
that inserts a <CODE>NULL</CODE> in an <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> field and also
uses <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed an unlikely bug that could cause a memory overrun when using
<CODE>ORDER BY constant_expression</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a table corruption in <TT>`myisamchk'</TT>'s parallel repair mode.
<LI>

Fixed bug in query cache invalidation on simple table renaming.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqladmin --relative</CODE>.
<LI>

On some 64 bit systems, <CODE>show status</CODE> reported a strange number for
<CODE>Open_files</CODE> and <CODE>Open_streams</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed wrong number of columns in <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> on empty table.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> that caused zero rows to be returned in
the case the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> condition was evaluated as <CODE>FALSE</CODE> after
reading const tables. (Unlikely condition).
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH PRIVILEGES</CODE> didn't correctly flush table/column privileges
when <CODE>mysql.tables_priv</CODE> is empty.
<LI>

Fixed bug in replication when using <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> one a file
that updated and auto_increment field with <CODE>NULL</CODE> or <CODE>0</CODE>. This
bug only affected MySQL 4.0 masters (not slaves or MySQL 3.23 masters).
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: If you have a slave that has replicated a file with
generated auto_increment fields then the slave data is corrupted and you
should reinitialise the affected tables from the master.
<LI>

Fixed possible memory overrun when sending a blob &#62; 16M to the client.
<LI>

Fixed wrong error message when setting a <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> field to an
expression that returned <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>str LIKE "%other_str%"</CODE> where <CODE>str</CODE> or
<CODE>other_str</CODE> contained characters &#62;= 128.
<LI>

Fixed bug: When executing on master <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE> and InnoDB failed
with <CODE>table full</CODE> error the binary log was corrupted.

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

<UL>
<LI>

<CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> will for MyISAM tables treat all <CODE>NULL</CODE>
values as different when calculating cardinality.  This helps in
optimising joins between tables where one of the tables has a lot of
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values in a indexed column:

<PRE>
SELECT * from t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.key_with_a_lot_of_null;
</PRE>

<LI>

Added join operator <CODE>FORCE INDEX (key_list)</CODE>. This acts likes
<CODE>USE INDEX (key_list)</CODE> but with the addition that a table scan is
assumed to be VERY expensive.  One bad thing with this is that it makes
<CODE>FORCE</CODE> a reserved word.
<LI>

Reset internal row buffer in MyISAM after each query. This will reduce
memory in the case you have a lot of big blobs in a table.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

A security patch in 4.0.8 causes the mysqld server to die if the remote
hostname can't be resolved. This is now fixed.
<LI>

Fixed crash when replication big <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> statement that
caused log rotation.
</UL>

Default <CODE>max_packet_length</CODE> for libmysqld.c is now 1024*1024*1024.
<LI>

One can now specify <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> in a file ready by
<CODE>mysql_options(MYSQL_READ_DEFAULT_FILE)</CODE>.
for clients.
<LI>

When sending a too big packet to the server with the not compressed
protocol, the client now gets an error message instead of a lost
connection.
<LI>

We now send big queries/result rows in bigger hunks, which should give a
small speed improvement.
<LI>

Fixed some bugs with the compressed protocol for rows &#62; 16M.
<LI>

InnoDB tables now also supports <CODE>ON UPDATE CASCADE</CODE> in
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> constraints. See the InnoDB section in the manual
for the InnoDB changelog.
</UL>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> with BDB tables.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>QUOTE()</CODE> function.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling communication packets bigger than
16M. Unfortunately this required a protocol change; If you upgrade the
server to 4.0.8 and above and have clients that uses packets &#62;=
255*255*255 bytes (=16581375) you must also upgrade your clients to at
least 4.0.8.  If you don't upgrade, the clients will hang when sending a
big packet.
<LI>

Fixed bug when sending blobs longer than 16M to client.
<LI>

Fixed compilation problems on OpenUnix and HPUX 10.20.
<LI>

Fixed some optimisation problems when compiling MySQL with <CODE>-DBIG_TABLES</CODE>
on a 32 bit system.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_drop_db()</CODE> didn't check permissions properly so anyone could

Added syntax support for <CODE>CHARACTER SET xxx</CODE> and <CODE>CHARSET=xxx</CODE>
table options (to be able to read table dumps from 4.1).
<LI>

Fixed replication bug that caused the slave to loose its position in
some cases when the replication log was rotated.
<LI>

Fixed that a slave will restart from the start of a transaction if
it's killed in the middle of one.
<LI>

Moved the manual pages from <TT>`man'</TT> to <TT>`man/man1'</TT> in the
binary distributions.
<LI>

The default type returned by <CODE>IFNULL(A,B)</CODE> is now set to be the
more 'general' of the types of <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>. (The order is
<CODE>STRING</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE> or <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>).
<LI>

Moved the <TT>`mysql.server'</TT> startup script in the RPM packages from
<TT>`/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql'</TT> to <TT>`/etc/init.d/mysql'</TT>
(which almost all current Linux distributions support for LSB compliance).
<LI>

Added <CODE>Qcache_lowmem_prunes</CODE> status variable (number of queries that were
deleted from cache because of low memory).
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE> so it can deal with table names containing dashes.
<LI>

Bulk insert optimisation
(see section <A HREF="manual.html#SHOW_VARIABLES">4.5.6.4  <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE></A>)
is no longer used when inserting small (less than 100) number of rows.
<LI>

Optimisation added for queries like
<CODE>SELECT ... FROM merge_table WHERE indexed_column=constant_expr</CODE>.

The <CODE>CURRENT_USER()</CODE> function can be used to get a <CODE>user@host</CODE>
value as it was matched in the <CODE>GRANT</CODE> system.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Miscellaneous_functions">6.3.6.2  Miscellaneous Functions</A>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>CHECK</CODE> constraints to be compatible with ANSI SQL. This made
<CODE>CHECK</CODE> a reserved word. (Checking of <CODE>CHECK</CODE> constraints is
still not implemented).
<LI>

Added <CODE>CAST(... as CHAR)</CODE>.
<LI>

Added PostgreSQL compatible <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> syntax:
<CODE>SELECT ... LIMIT # OFFSET #</CODE>

<P>
Bugs fixed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fixed number of found rows returned in <CODE>multi table updates</CODE>
<LI>

Make <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> default on Mac OS X as the file system
is case sensitive.
<LI>

<LI>

A fix for the bug in a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> with joined tables with
<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> and <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> clause when filesort had to be used.
In that case <CODE>LIMIT</CODE> was applied to filesort of one of the tables,
although it could not be.
This fix solved problems with <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> too.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_server_init()</CODE> now makes a copy of all arguments. This fixes
a problem when using the embedded server in C# program.
<LI>

Fixed buffer overrun in <CODE>libmysqlclient</CODE> library
that allowed a malicious <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server to crash the client
application.
<LI>

Fixed security-related bug in <CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE> handling.
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.6.

<H3><A NAME="News-4.0.5" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-4.0.5">D.3.8  Changes in release 4.0.5 (13 Nov 2002)</A></H3>

<P>
Functionality added or changed:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Port number was added to host name (if it is known) in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>
command
<LI>

Changed handling of last argument in <CODE>WEEK()</CODE> so that one can get
week number according to the ISO 8601 specification.
(Old code should still work).
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE> threads doesn't hang on <CODE>Waiting for
INSERT</CODE> when one sends a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> to mysqld.
<LI>

Change that <CODE>AND</CODE> works according to SQL ANSI99 when it comes to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> handling. In practice, this only affects queries where you
do something like <CODE>WHERE ... NOT (NULL AND 0)</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now resolve <CODE>basedir</CODE> to its full path (with
<CODE>realpath()</CODE>). This enables one to use relative symlinks to the
MySQL installation directory.  This will however cause <CODE>show
variables</CODE> to report different directories on systems where there is
a symbolic link in the path.
<LI>

Fixed that MySQL will not use index scan on index disabled with
<CODE>IGNORE INDEX</CODE> or <CODE>USE INDEX</CODE>.
to be ignored.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--use-frm</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>. When used with
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, it gets the table structure from the <CODE>.frm</CODE> file, so the
table can be repaired even if the <CODE>.MYI</CODE> header is corrupted.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>MAX()</CODE> optimisation when used with <CODE>JOIN</CODE> and
<CODE>ON</CODE> expressions.
<LI>

Added support for reading of MySQL 4.1 table definition files.
<LI>

<CODE>BETWEEN</CODE> behaviour changed (see section <A HREF="manual.html#Comparison_Operators">6.3.1.2  Comparison Operators</A>).
Now <CODE>datetime_col BETWEEN timestamp AND timestamp</CODE> should work
as expected.
<LI>

One can create <CODE>TEMPORARY</CODE> <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables now.
<LI>

<CODE>DELETE FROM myisam_table</CODE> now shrinks not only the <TT>`.MYD'</TT> file but
also the <TT>`.MYI'</TT> file.
<LI>

When one uses the <CODE>--open-files-limit=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE>
it's now passed on to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed output from <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> from <CODE>'where used'</CODE> to
<CODE>'Using where'</CODE> to make it more in line with other output.
<LI>

Removed variable <CODE>safe_show_database</CODE> as it was not used anymore.
<LI>

Updated source tree to be built using <CODE>automake 1.5</CODE> and 
<CODE>libtool 1.4</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed an inadvertently changed option (<CODE>--ignore-space</CODE>) back to the
original <CODE>--ignore-spaces</CODE> in <CODE>mysqlclient</CODE>. (Both syntaxes will
work).
<LI>

Don't require <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> privilege when using <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added support for <CODE>DROP TEMPORARY TABLE ...</CODE>, to be used to make
replication safer.
<LI>

When transactions are enabled, all commands that update temporary tables
inside a <CODE>BEGIN/COMMIT</CODE> are now stored in the binary log on
<CODE>COMMIT</CODE> and not stored if one does <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE>.  This fixes
some problems with non-transactional temporary tables used inside
transactions.
<LI>

Allow braces in joins in all positions. Formerly, things like
<CODE>SELECT * FROM (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a)), t1</CODE> worked, but
not <CODE>SELECT * FROM t1, (t2 LEFT JOIN t3 USING (a))</CODE>. Note that
braces are simply removed, they do not change the way the join is
executed.
<LI>

InnoDB now supports also isolation levels
<CODE>READ UNCOMMITTED</CODE> and <CODE>READ COMMITTED</CODE>.
For a detailed InnoDB changelog, see section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB_change_history">7.5.14  InnoDB Change History</A>
in this manual.

The filename argument for the <CODE>--des-key-file</CODE> argument to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
is interpreted relative to the data directory if given as a relative pathname.
<LI>

Removed a condition that temp table with index on column that can be
<CODE>NULL</CODE> has to be <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. This was okay for 3.23, but not
needed in 4.*. This resulted in slowdown in many queries since 4.0.2.

Small code improvement in multi-table updates.
<LI>

Fixed a newly introduced bug that caused <CODE>ORDER BY ... LIMIT #</CODE>
to not return all rows.

in this database are not cached in the query cache.
<LI>

Small fix in <CODE>mysqld_safe</CODE> for some shells.

Fixed bug in <CODE>MATCH ... AGAINST( ... IN BOOLEAN MODE)</CODE>
used with <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> and <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES</CODE> privilege on
the database level.  One must run the <CODE>mysql_fix_privilege_tables</CODE>
script on old installations to activate these.
<LI>

In <CODE>SHOW TABLE ... STATUS</CODE>, compressed tables sometimes showed up as

<LI>

<CODE>AND</CODE> is now optional between <CODE>REQUIRE</CODE> options.

so core files can be generated.
<LI>

Fixed bug in query cache after temporary table creation.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--count=N</CODE> (<CODE>-c</CODE>) option to <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, to make the

<LI>

Fix <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> to work with <CODE>UNION</CODE>s. It will work only
if the first <CODE>SELECT</CODE> has this option and if there is global <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>
for the entire statement. For the moment, this requires using parentheses for
individual <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries within the statement.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</CODE> and <CODE>LIMIT</CODE>.
<LI>

Don't give an error for <CODE>CREATE TABLE ...(... VARCHAR(0))</CODE>.

<CODE>net_store_length()</CODE> linked in the <CODE>CONVERT::store()</CODE> method.
<LI>

<CODE>DOUBLE</CODE> and <CODE>FLOAT</CODE> columns now honor the <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> flag
on storage.

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now retains foreign key constraints through <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>
and <CODE>CREATE/DROP INDEX</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now allows foreign key constraints to be added through the
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> syntax.
<LI>

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables can now be set to automatically grow in size (autoextend).
<LI>

Added <CODE>--ignore-lines=n</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>.  This has the
same effect as the <CODE>IGNORE n LINES</CODE> clause for <CODE>LOAD DATA</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>UNION</CODE> with last offset being transposed to total result
set.
<LI>

<CODE>REPAIR ... USE_FRM</CODE> added.

Fixed bug that sometimes appeared when full-text search was used
with ``const'' tables.
<LI>

Fixed incorrect error value when doing a <CODE>SELECT</CODE> with an empty
<CODE>HEAP</CODE> table.
<LI>

Use <CODE>ORDER BY column DESC</CODE> now sorts <CODE>NULL</CODE> values first.

<LI>

Fixed some problems with <CODE>USE/IGNORE INDEX</CODE> when using
many keys with the same start column.

Optimised <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> sort-buffer handling to take less memory.
<LI>

Fixed bug in multi-table <CODE>DELETE</CODE> and <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.

Added <CODE>NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION</CODE> to the set of flags that may be
specified with the <CODE>--sql-mode</CODE> option for <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  It disables
unsigned arithmetic rules when it comes to subtraction. (This will make
MySQL 4.0 behave more closely to 3.23 with <CODE>UNSIGNED</CODE> columns).
<LI>

The result returned for all bit functions (<CODE>|</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;&#60;</CODE>, ...) is now of
type <CODE>unsigned integer</CODE>.

Changed to use <CODE>autoconf</CODE> 2.52 (from <CODE>autoconf</CODE> 2.13).
<LI>

Fixed optimisation problem where the MySQL Server was in ``preparing'' state
for a long time when selecting from an empty table which had contained
a lot of rows.
<LI>

Fixed bug in complicated join with <CODE>const</CODE> tables. This fix also

<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>FLUSH QUERY CACHE</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>CAST()</CODE> and <CODE>CONVERT()</CODE> functions. The <CODE>CAST</CODE> and
<CODE>CONVERT</CODE> functions are nearly identical and mainly useful when you
want to create a column with a specific type in a <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE>
statement.  For more information, read section <A HREF="manual.html#Cast_Functions">6.3.5  Cast Functions</A>.

<H2><A NAME="News-3.23.x" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.x">D.4  Changes in release 3.23.x (Stable)</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1856"></A>

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release has several major features that are not
present in previous versions.  We have added three new
table types:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
<DD>
A new ISAM library which is tuned for SQL and supports large files.
<DT><CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
<DD>
A transaction-safe storage engine that supports row level locking, and many
Oracle-like features.
<DT><CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> or <CODE>BDB</CODE>
<DD>
Uses the Berkeley DB library from Sleepycat Software to implement
transaction-safe tables.
</DL>

<P>
Note that only <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> is available in the standard binary distribution.

</P>
<P>
The 3.23 release also includes support for database replication between
a master and many slaves, full-text indexing, and much more.

</P>
<P>
All new features are being developed in the 4.x version.  Only
bug fixes and minor enhancements to existing features will be
added to 3.23.

</P>
<P>
The replication code and BerkeleyDB code is still not as tested and as
the rest of the code, so we will probably need to do a couple of future
releases of 3.23 with small fixes for this part of the code. As long as
you don't use these features, you should be quite safe with
MySQL 3.23!

</P>
<P>
Note that the above doesn't mean that replication or Berkeley DB don't
work.  We have done a lot of testing of all code, including replication
and <CODE>BDB</CODE> without finding any problems.  It only means that not as many
users use this code as the rest of the code and because of this we are
not yet 100% confident in this code.

</P>

Security enhancement:
<TT>`mysqld'</TT> no longer reads options from world-writeable config files.
<LI>

Security enhancement:
<TT>`mysqld'</TT> and <TT>`safe_mysqld'</TT> now only use the first <CODE>--user</CODE>
option specified on the command line. (Normally this comes from
<TT>`/etc/my.cnf'</TT>)
<LI>

Security enhancement:
Don't allow <CODE>BACKUP TABLE</CODE> to overwrite existing files.
<LI>

Fixed unlikely deadlock bug when one thread did a <CODE>LOCK TABLE</CODE> and
another thread did a <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>.  In this case one could do
a <CODE>KILL</CODE> on one of the threads to resolve the deadlock.

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> was not replicated by slave if
<CODE>replicate_*_table</CODE> was set on the slave.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in handling <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns that could cause wrong
results from the query.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> on 64-bit platforms. The bug was
caused by wrong declaration of variable <CODE>server_id</CODE>.
<LI>

The Comment column in <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> now reports that it can
contain <CODE>NULL</CODE> values (which is the case for a crashed <TT>`.frm'</TT> file).
<LI>

Fixed the <CODE>rpl_rotate_logs</CODE> test to not fail on certain platforms (e.g.
Mac OS X) due to a too long file name (changed <CODE>slave-master-info.opt</CODE>

<CODE>poll()</CODE> system call, which resulted in timeout the value specified as
it was executed in both <CODE>select()</CODE> and <CODE>poll()</CODE>.

Fixed bug in
<CODE>SELECT * FROM table WHERE datetime1 IS NULL OR datetime2 IS NULL</CODE>.

When running with <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> (default on windows)
and you had tables or databases with mixed case on disk, then
executing <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> followed with <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>

On some 64 bit systems, <CODE>show status</CODE> reported a strange number for
<CODE>Open_files</CODE> and <CODE>Open_streams</CODE>.

<LI>

Fixed double <CODE>free</CODE>'d pointer bug in <CODE>mysql_change_user()</CODE>
handling, that enabled a specially hacked version of MySQL client
to crash <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. <STRONG>Note</STRONG>, that one needs to login to the server
by using a valid user account to be able to exploit this bug.
<LI>

Fixed bug with the <CODE>--slow-log</CODE> when logging an administrator command
(like <CODE>FLUSH TABLES</CODE>).
<LI>

Bugfix for <CODE>--chroot</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#News-3.23.54">D.4.4  Changes in release 3.23.54 (05 Dec 2002)</A>)
is reverted. Unfortunately, there is no way to make it to work, without
introducing backward-incompatible changes in <TT>`my.cnf'</TT>.
Those who need <CODE>--chroot</CODE> functionality, should upgrade to MySQL 4.0.

<LI>

Make <CODE>--lower-case-table-names</CODE> default on Mac OS X as the file system
is case insensitive.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <TT>`scripts/mysqld_safe.sh'</TT> in <CODE>NOHUP_NICENESS</CODE>
testing.
<LI>

Transactions in <CODE>AUTOCOMMIT=0</CODE> mode didn't rotate binary log.

Fixed a bug in <CODE>scripts/make_binary_distribution</CODE> that resulted in
a remaining <CODE>@HOSTNAME@</CODE> variable instead of replacing it with the
correct path to the <CODE>hostname</CODE> binary.

Fixed a very unlikely bug that could cause <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE> to core
dump in pthread_mutex_unlock() if a new thread was connecting.
<LI>

Forbid <CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> if the thread executing the query has locked
tables.  This removes a possible deadlock situation.

<LI>

Fixed unlikely caching bug when doing a join without keys. In this case
the last used field for a table always returned <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Added options to make <CODE>LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</CODE> more secure.

MySQL binary release 3.23.48 for Linux contained a new <CODE>glibc</CODE> library,
which has serious problems under high load and RedHat 7.2.  The 3.23.49 binary
release doesn't have this problem.

Some <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> variables were always shown in <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> as
<CODE>OFF</CODE> on high-byte-first systems (like SPARC).
<LI>

Fixed problem with one thread using an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table and another
thread doing an <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> on the same table. Before that,
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> could crash with an assertion failure in <TT>`row0row.c'</TT>,
line 474.
<LI>

Tuned the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> SQL optimiser to favor index searches more often
over table scans.
<LI>

Fixed a performance problem with <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables when several large
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries are run concurrently on a multiprocessor Linux
computer.  Large CPU-bound <CODE>SELECT</CODE> queries will now also generally
run faster on all platforms.
<LI>

If MySQL binlogging is used, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now prints after crash recovery the
latest MySQL binlog name and the offset <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> was able to recover
to. This is useful, for example, when resynchronising a master and a
slave database in replication.

<CODE>InnoDB</CODE> now prevents a <CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> declaration where the
signedness is not the same in the referencing and referenced integer columns.
<LI>

Calling <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>SHOW TABLE STATUS</CODE> could cause
memory corruption and make <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crash.  Especially at risk was
<CODE>mysqldump</CODE>, because it frequently calls <CODE>SHOW CREATE TABLE</CODE>.

If inserts to several tables containing an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column were
wrapped inside one <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>, <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> asserted in
<TT>`lock0lock.c'</TT>.
<LI>

In 3.23.47 we allowed several <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in a <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> secondary
index for an <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> table.  But <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> was not relaxed: it
reports the table as corrupt.  <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> no longer complains in
this situation.

<CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> now shows <CODE>REFERENCES</CODE> instead of <CODE>REFERENCE</CODE>.

The <CODE>doublewrite</CODE> file flush method is used in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
It reduces the need for Unix <CODE>fsync()</CODE> calls to a fraction and
improves performance on most Unix flavors.
<LI>

You can now use the <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Monitor to print a lot of <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> state
information, including locks, to the standard output.  This is useful in
performance tuning.

Several bugs which could cause hangs in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> have been fixed.
<LI>

Split <CODE>record_buffer</CODE> to <CODE>record_buffer</CODE> and

Fixed problem when using <CODE>GRANT FILE ON database.* ...</CODE>; previously
we added the <CODE>DROP</CODE> privilege for the database.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>DELETE FROM tbl_name ... LIMIT 0</CODE> and
<CODE>UPDATE FROM tbl_name ... LIMIT 0</CODE>, which acted as though the

rows).
<LI>

<CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> now checks if an <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> column contains
the value 0.
<LI>

Sending a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now only flush the logs,
not reset the replication.

<LI>

Option <CODE>--force</CODE> to <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> now also updates states.

New program <CODE>mysqlcheck</CODE>.
<LI>

Added database name to output for administrative commands like <CODE>CHECK</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>, <CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE>.
<LI>

Lots of portability fixes for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed optimiser so that queries like
<CODE>SELECT * FROM tbl_name,tbl_name2 ... ORDER BY key_part1 LIMIT #</CODE>
will use index on <CODE>key_part1</CODE> instead of <CODE>filesort</CODE>.

Added <CODE>--mysql-version</CODE> option to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>
<LI>

Changed <CODE>INNOBASE</CODE> to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> (because the <CODE>INNOBASE</CODE>
name was already used). All <CODE>configure</CODE> options and <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
start options now use <CODE>innodb</CODE> instead of <CODE>innobase</CODE>. This
means that before upgrading to this version, you have to change any
configuration files where you have used <CODE>innobase</CODE> options!
<LI>

Fixed bug when using indexes on <CODE>CHAR(255) NULL</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Slave thread will now be started even if <CODE>master-host</CODE> is not set, as

Partial updates (terminated with kill) are now logged with a special error
code to the binary log. Slave will refuse to execute them if the error code
indicates the update was terminated abnormally, and will have to be recovered
with <CODE>SET SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1; SLAVE START</CODE> after a manual sanity
check/correction of data integrity.
<LI>

Fixed bug that erroneously logged a drop of internal temporary table
on thread termination to the binary log -- this bug affected replication.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>REGEXP</CODE> on 64-bit machines.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>DELETE</CODE> with <CODE>WHERE unique_key_part IS NULL</CODE>
didn't update/delete all rows.

with wrong date format.

UDFs now also work on Windows. (Patch by Ralph Mason.)
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> that disabled
key-sorting. These commands should now be faster in most cases.

Fixed performance bug where reopened tables (tables that had been
waiting for <CODE>FLUSH</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>) would not use indexes for the
next query.
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables on FreeBSD.
<LI>

Added <CODE>mysqld</CODE> variables <CODE>myisam_max_sort_file_size</CODE> and
<CODE>myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size</CODE>.
<LI>

Initialise signals early to avoid problem with signals in <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>.
<LI>

Applied patch for the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set to make comparisons
case-independent and to fix a bug in <CODE>LIKE</CODE> for this character set.
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: All tables that uses the <CODE>tis620</CODE> character set must be
fixed with  <CODE>myisamchk -r</CODE> or <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> !
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

Fixed bug that caused a core dump when using a very complex query involving
<CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> and summary functions.

Fixed a bug in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> where keys weren't always used to find the
rows to be updated.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>CONCAT_WS()</CODE> where it returned incorrect results.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>CREATE ... SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> to not
allow concurrent inserts as this could make the binary log hard to repeat.
(Concurrent inserts are enabled if you are not using the binary or update log.)

Portability fixes for OpenBSD and OS/2.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--temp-pool</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.  Using this option
will cause most temporary files created to use a small set of names,

memory, as it's being allocated to the directory entry cache instead of
the disk cache.

Added <CODE>have_bdb</CODE>, <CODE>have_gemini</CODE>, <CODE>have_innobase</CODE>,
<CODE>have_raid</CODE> and <CODE>have_openssl</CODE> to <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE> to make it
easy to test for supported extensions.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--open-files-limit</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>--open-files</CODE> option to <CODE>--open-files-limit</CODE> in
<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where some rows were not found with <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables
that had many keys.
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>--bdb-no-sync</CODE> works.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>--bdb-recover</CODE> to <CODE>--bdb-no-recover</CODE> as recover should

<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.29" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.29">D.4.30  Changes in release 3.23.29 (16 Dec 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Configure updates for Tru64, large file support, and better TCP wrapper
support. By Albert Chin-A-Young.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> operator.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>REPLACE</CODE> with <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

<CODE>LPAD()</CODE> and <CODE>RPAD()</CODE> will shorten the result string if it's longer
than the length argument.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SHOW LOGS</CODE> command.
<LI>

Remove unused <CODE>BDB</CODE> logs on shutdown.
<LI>

When creating a table, put <CODE>PRIMARY</CODE> keys first, followed by
<CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> keys.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> involving multi-part keys where one
specified all key parts both in the update and the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part. In
this case MySQL could try to update a record that didn't match
the whole <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part.
<LI>

Changed drop table to first drop the tables and then the <TT>`.frm'</TT> file.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the hostname cache which caused <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to report the
hostname as <CODE>''</CODE> in some error messages.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>HEAP</CODE> type tables; the variable
<CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE> wasn't used. Now either <CODE>MAX_ROWS</CODE> or
<CODE>max_heap_table_size</CODE> can be used to limit the size of a <CODE>HEAP</CODE>
type table.
<LI>

Changed the default server-id to 1 for masters and 2 for slaves
to make it easier to use the binary log.
<LI>

Renamed <CODE>bdb_lock_max</CODE> variable to <CODE>bdb_max_lock</CODE>.
<LI>

Added support for <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> on sub-fields for <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

Added <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE> of <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

In <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables, we now store the number of rows; this helps to optimise
queries when we need an approximation of the number of rows.
<LI>

If we get an error in a multi-row statement, we now only roll back the
last statement, not the entire transaction.
<LI>

If you do a <CODE>ROLLBACK</CODE> when you have updated a non-transactional table
you will get an error as a warning.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--bdb-shared-data</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>Slave_open_temp_tables</CODE> status variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
<LI>

Added <CODE>binlog_cache_size</CODE> and <CODE>max_binlog_cache_size</CODE> variables to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and
<CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> are now transaction endpoints.
<LI>

If you do a <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> on a symbolically linked database, both
the link and the original database is deleted.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE> to work on OS/2.
<LI>

Fixed bug when doing a <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT ... table1 LEFT JOIN
table2 ...</CODE> when <CODE>table2</CODE> was empty.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--abort-slave-event-count</CODE> and
<CODE>--disconnect-slave-event-count</CODE> options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> for
debugging and testing of replication.
<LI>

Fixed replication of temporary tables. Handles everything except
slave server restart.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW KEYS</CODE> now shows whether key is <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>.
<LI>

New script <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysqld_multi">4.7.3  <CODE>mysqld_multi</CODE>, A Program for Managing Multiple MySQL Servers</A>.
<LI>

Added new script, <CODE>mysql-multi.server.sh</CODE>.  Thanks to
Tim Bunce <a HREF="mailto:Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk">Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk</a> for modifying <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> to
easily handle hosts running many <CODE>mysqld</CODE> processes.
<LI>

<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>, <CODE>mysql.server</CODE>, and <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> have
been modified to use <CODE>mysql_print_defaults</CODE> instead of various hacks
to read the <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> files.  In addition, the handling of various
paths has been made more consistent with how <CODE>mysqld</CODE> handles them
by default.
<LI>

Automatically remove Berkeley DB transaction logs that no longer are in
use.
<LI>

Fixed bug with several <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> indexes in one table.
<LI>

Added a warning if number of rows changes on <CODE>REPAIR</CODE>/<CODE>OPTIMIZE</CODE>.
<LI>

Applied patches for OS/2 by <CODE>Yuri Dario</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH TABLES tbl_name</CODE> didn't always flush the index tree
to disk properly.
<LI>

<CODE>--bootstrap</CODE> is now run in a separate thread. This fixes a problem
that caused <CODE>mysql_install_db</CODE> to core dump on some Linux machines.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>mi_create()</CODE> to use less stack space.
<LI>

Fixed bug with optimiser trying to over-optimise <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> when used
with <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE> key.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>crash-me</CODE> and the MySQL benchmarks to also work
with FrontBase.
<LI>

Allow <CODE>RESTRICT</CODE> and <CODE>CASCADE</CODE> after <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> to make
porting easier.
<LI>

Reset status variable which could cause problem if one used <CODE>--slow-log</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>connect_timeout</CODE> variable to <CODE>mysql</CODE> and <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>connect-timeout</CODE> as an alias for <CODE>timeout</CODE> for option files
read by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.28" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.28">D.4.31  Changes in release 3.23.28 (22 Nov 2000: Gamma)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Added new options <CODE>--pager[=...]</CODE>, <CODE>--no-pager</CODE>,
<CODE>--tee=...</CODE> and <CODE>--no-tee</CODE> to the <CODE>mysql</CODE> client.  The
new corresponding interactive commands are <CODE>pager</CODE>, <CODE>nopager</CODE>,
<CODE>tee</CODE> and <CODE>notee</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#mysql">4.8.2  <CODE>mysql</CODE>, The Command-line Tool</A>, <CODE>mysql --help</CODE>
and the interactive help for more information.
<LI>

Fixed crash when automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> table failed.
<LI>

Fixed a major performance bug in the table locking code when one
constantly had a lot of <CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and <CODE>INSERT</CODE>
statements running. The symptom was that the <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> and
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> queries were locked for a long time while new <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements were executed before the updates.
<LI>

When reading <CODE>options_files</CODE> with <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE> the
<CODE>return-found-rows</CODE> option was ignored.
<LI>

One can now specify <CODE>interactive-timeout</CODE> in the option file that
is read by <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>. This makes it possible to force
programs that run for a long time (like <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>) to use the
<CODE>interactive_timeout</CODE> time instead of the <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> time.
<LI>

Added to the slow query log the time and the user name for each logged
query. If you are using <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> then also queries that
do not use an index are logged, even if the query takes less than
<CODE>long_query_time</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

Fixed a problem in <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> which caused all columns in a reference
table to be <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem when using <CODE>NATURAL JOIN</CODE> without keys.
<LI>

Fixed a bug when using a multi-part keys where the first part was of type
<CODE>TEXT</CODE> or <CODE>BLOB</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>DROP</CODE> of temporary tables wasn't stored in the update/binary log.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT * ... LIMIT #</CODE> only returned one row.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in the assembler code in <CODE>strstr()</CODE> for SPARC and cleaned up
the <TT>`global.h'</TT> header file to avoid a problem with bad aliasing with
the compiler submitted with RedHat 7.0. (Reported by Trond Eivind Glomsrød)
<LI>

The <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option now works properly on NT.
<LI>

Fixed a long outstanding bug in the <CODE>ISAM</CODE> tables when a row with a length
of more than 65K was shortened by a single byte.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> when running multiple updating processes on
the same table.
<LI>

Allow one to use <CODE>FLUSH TABLE tbl_name</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--replicate-ignore-table</CODE>, <CODE>--replicate-do-table</CODE>,
<CODE>--replicate-wild-ignore-table</CODE>, and <CODE>--replicate-wild-do-table</CODE>
options to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed all log files to use our own <CODE>IO_CACHE</CODE> mechanism instead of
<CODE>FILE</CODE> to avoid OS problems when there are many files open.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--open-files</CODE> and <CODE>--timezone</CODE> options to <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a fatal bug in <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... SELECT ...</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>CREATE TABLE ... SELECT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Added variables <CODE>large_file_support</CODE>,<CODE>net_read_timeout</CODE>,
<CODE>net_write_timeout</CODE> and <CODE>query_buffer_size</CODE> to <CODE>SHOW VARIABLES</CODE>.
<LI>

Added status variables <CODE>created_tmp_files</CODE> and <CODE>sort_merge_passes</CODE>
to <CODE>SHOW STATUS</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where we didn't allow an index name after the
<CODE>FOREIGN KEY</CODE> definition.
<LI>

Added <CODE>TRUNCATE table_name</CODE> as a synonym for
<CODE>DELETE FROM table_name</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> key compare function when comparing part keys.
<LI>

Added <CODE>bdb_lock_max</CODE> variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added more tests to the benchmark suite.
<LI>

Fixed an overflow bug in the client code when using overly long database names.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE> now aborts on Linux if the server doesn't answer in
<CODE>timeout</CODE> seconds.
<LI>

<CODE>SLAVE START</CODE> did not work if you started with
<CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> and had not explicitly run <CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed the output of <CODE>SHOW MASTER STATUS</CODE> to be consistent with
<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE>. (It now has no directory in the log name.)
<LI>

Added <CODE>PURGE MASTER LOGS TO</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SHOW MASTER LOGS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--safemalloc-mem-limit</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to simulate memory
shortage when compiled with the <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed several core dumps in out-of-memory conditions.
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</CODE> was using an uninitialised mutex if the slave had
not been started yet.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>ELT()</CODE> and <CODE>MAKE_SET()</CODE> when the query used
a temporary table.
<LI>

<CODE>CHANGE MASTER TO</CODE> without specifying <CODE>MASTER_LOG_POS</CODE> would
set it to 0 instead of 4 and hit the magic number in the master binlog.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ...</CODE> syntax added.  This will create the
new table with the rows in a specific order.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.27" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.27">D.4.32  Changes in release 3.23.27 (24 Oct 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed a bug where the automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables sometimes failed
when the datafile was corrupt.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>SHOW CREATE</CODE> when using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables to use new compare function in Berkeley DB 3.2.3.

<LI>

Small portability fixes.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.26" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.26">D.4.33  Changes in release 3.23.26 (18 Oct 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Renamed <CODE>FLUSH MASTER</CODE> and <CODE>FLUSH SLAVE</CODE> to <CODE>RESET MASTER</CODE>
and <CODE>RESET SLAVE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>&#60;&#62;</CODE> to work properly with <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with <CODE>SUBSTRING_INDEX()</CODE> and <CODE>REPLACE()</CODE>.
(Patch by Alexander Igonitchev)
<LI>

Fix <CODE>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</CODE> not to produce an error
if the table exists.
<LI>

If you don't create a <CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> in a <CODE>BDB</CODE> table, a hidden
<CODE>PRIMARY KEY</CODE> will be created.
<LI>

Added read-only-key optimisation to <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
<LI>

<CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> in some cases preferred a full table scan when there was
no <CODE>WHERE</CODE> clause.
<LI>

When using <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>, don't count the time waiting for a lock.
<LI>

Fixed bug in lock code on Windows which could cause the key cache
to report that the key file was crashed even if it was okay.
<LI>

Automatic repair of <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables if you start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--myisam-recover</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed the <CODE>TYPE=</CODE> keyword from <CODE>CHECK</CODE> and
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE>. Allow <CODE>CHECK</CODE> options to be combined. (You can still
use <CODE>TYPE=</CODE>, but this usage is deprecated.)
<LI>

Fixed mutex bug in the binary replication log -- long update queries could
be read only in part by the slave if it did it at the wrong time, which
was not fatal, but resulted in a performance-degrading reconnect and
a scary message in the error log.
<LI>

Changed the format of the binary log -- added magic number, server
version, binlog version. Added server id and query error code for each
query event.
<LI>

Replication thread from the slave now will kill all the stale threads
from the same server.
<LI>

Long replication user names were not being handled properly.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--replicate-rewrite-db</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-slave-start</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Updates that generated an error code (such as <CODE>INSERT INTO foo(some_key)
values (1),(1)</CODE>) erroneously terminated the slave thread.
<LI>

Added optimisation of queries where <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is only used on columns
from some of the tables.
<LI>

Allow floating-point numbers where there is no sign after the exponent
(like <CODE>1e1</CODE>).
<LI>

<CODE>SHOW GRANTS</CODE> didn't always show all column grants.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--default-extra-file=#</CODE> option to all MySQL clients.
<LI>

Columns referenced in <CODE>INSERT</CODE> statements now are initialised properly.
<LI>

<CODE>UPDATE</CODE> didn't always work when used with a range on a timestamp that
was part of the key that was used to find rows.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index when inserting a <CODE>NULL</CODE> column.
<LI>

Changed to use <CODE>mkstemp()</CODE> instead of <CODE>tempnam()</CODE>. Based
on a patch from John Jones.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.25" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.25">D.4.34  Changes in release 3.23.25 (29 Sep 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Fixed that <CODE>databasename</CODE> works as second argument to <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE>.
<LI>

The values for the <CODE>UMASK</CODE> and <CODE>UMASK_DIR</CODE> environment variables
now can be specified in octal by beginning the value with a zero.
<LI>

Added <CODE>RIGHT JOIN</CODE>. This makes <CODE>RIGHT</CODE> a reserved word.
<LI>

Added <CODE>@@IDENTITY</CODE> as a synonym for <CODE>LAST_INSERT_ID()</CODE>.
(This is for MSSQL compatibility.)
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> and <CODE>REPAIR</CODE> when using <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE>
index.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> now works with FIFOs.
(Patch by Toni L. Harbaugh-Blackford.)
<LI>

<CODE>FLUSH LOGS</CODE> broke replication if you specified a log name with an
explicit extension as the value of the <CODE>log-bin</CODE> option.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> with packed multi-part keys.
<LI>

Fixed crash when using <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> on Windows.
<LI>

Fixed a bug where <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index always used the <CODE>koi8_ukr</CODE>
character set.

log files couldn't be created.
<LI>

Added lock time and number of selected processed rows to slow query log.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--memlock</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to lock <CODE>mysqld</CODE>
in memory on systems with the <CODE>mlockall()</CODE> call (like in Solaris).
<LI>

<CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables didn't use keys properly. (Bug from 3.23.23.)
<LI>

Added better support for <CODE>MERGE</CODE> tables (keys, mapping, creation,
documentation...). See section <A HREF="manual.html#MERGE">7.2  <CODE>MERGE</CODE> Tables</A>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> from 3.23 which caused some <CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns
not to be quoted.
<LI>

Merged <CODE>analyze</CODE>, <CODE>check</CODE>, <CODE>optimize</CODE> and repair code.
<LI>

<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.24" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.24">D.4.35  Changes in release 3.23.24 (08 Sep 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Added <CODE>created_tmp_disk_tables</CODE> variable to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

To make it possible to reliably dump and restore tables with
<CODE>TIMESTAMP(X)</CODE> columns, MySQL now reports columns with <CODE>X</CODE>
other than 14 or 8 to be strings.
<LI>

Changed sort order for <CODE>latin1</CODE> as it was before MySQL Version 3.23.23.
Any table that was created or modified with 3.23.22 must be repaired if it has
<CODE>CHAR</CODE> columns that may contain characters with ASCII values greater than
128!
<LI>

Fixed small memory leak introduced from 3.23.22 when creating a
temporary table.
<LI>

Fixed problem with <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables and reading on a unique (not primary) key.
<LI>

Restored the <CODE>win1251</CODE> character set (it's now only marked deprecated).
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="News-3.23.23" HREF="manual_toc.html#News-3.23.23">D.4.36  Changes in release 3.23.23 (01 Sep 2000)</A></H3>


<UL>
<LI>

Changed sort order for 'German'; all tables created with 'German' sortorder
must be repaired with <CODE>REPAIR TABLE</CODE> or <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> before use!
<LI>

Added <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to get a core file on
Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies on the <CODE>SIGSEGV</CODE> signal.
<LI>

MySQL client <CODE>mysql</CODE> now starts with option
<CODE>--no-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-g</CODE>) by default. This option can be
disabled with <CODE>--enable-named-commands</CODE> (<CODE>-G</CODE>). This may cause
incompatibility problems in some cases, for example, in SQL scripts that
use named commands without a semicolon, etc. !  Long format commands
still work from the first line.
<LI>

Fixed a problem when using many pending <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> statements at
the same time.
<LI>

Optimiser didn't use keys properly when using <CODE>LEFT JOIN</CODE> on an
empty table.
<LI>

Added shorter help text when invoking <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with incorrect options.
<LI>

Fixed non-fatal <CODE>free()</CODE> bug in <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> index handling of
<CODE>DECIMAL</CODE>/<CODE>NUMERIC</CODE> keys.
<LI>

Fixed a bug in concurrent insert in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables.  In some contexts,
usage of <CODE>MIN(key_part)</CODE> or <CODE>MAX(key_part)</CODE> returned an empty set.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>mysqlhotcopy</CODE> to use the new <CODE>FLUSH TABLES table_list</CODE>
syntax. Only tables which are being backed up are flushed now.
<LI>

Changed behaviour of <CODE>--enable-thread-safe-client</CODE> so
that both non-threaded (<CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE>) and threaded
(<CODE>-lmysqlclient_r</CODE>) libraries are built.  Users who linked
against a threaded <CODE>-lmysqlclient</CODE> will need to link against
<CODE>-lmysqlclient_r</CODE> now.
<LI>

Added atomic <CODE>RENAME TABLE</CODE> command.
<LI>

Don't count <CODE>NULL</CODE> values in <CODE>COUNT(DISTINCT ...)</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> on empty tables and
<CODE>INSERT ... SELECT ...</CODE> on empty tables to create non-unique indexes
in a separate batch with sorting. This will make the above calls much
faster when you have many indexes.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> now logs the first used insert_id correctly.
<LI>

Fixed crash when adding a default value to a <CODE>BLOB</CODE> column.
<LI>

Fixed a bug with <CODE>DATE_ADD/DATE_SUB</CODE> where it returned a datetime instead
of a date.
<LI>

Fixed a problem with the thread cache which made some threads show up as
<CODE>***DEAD***</CODE> in <CODE>SHOW PROCESSLIST</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed a lock in our thr_rwlock code, which could make selects that run
at the same time as concurrent inserts crash. This only affects systems

When deleting rows with a non-unique key in a <CODE>HEAP</CODE> table, all rows
weren't always deleted.

<LI>

<CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE> now updates key statistics for the table.
<LI>

<CODE>ANALYZE TABLE</CODE> will now only update tables that have been changed
since the last <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>. Note that this is a new feature and tables
will not be marked to be analysed until they are updated in any way with
3.23.23 or newer.  For older tables, you have to do <CODE>CHECK TABLE</CODE>
to update the key distribution.
<LI>

Fixed some minor privilege problems with <CODE>CHECK</CODE>, <CODE>ANALYZE</CODE>,
<CODE>REPAIR</CODE> and <CODE>SHOW CREATE</CODE> commands.

table during index re-build.
<LI>

<CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> broke replication if the database was excluded
from replication.

<CODE>SLAVE STOP</CODE> now will not return until the slave thread actually exits.
<LI>

Full-text search via the <CODE>MATCH()</CODE> function and <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> index type
(for <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> files).  This makes <CODE>FULLTEXT</CODE> a reserved word.

<CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE> now also prints out whether MySQL needs to
create a temporary table or use file sorting when resolving the <CODE>SELECT</CODE>.
<LI>

Added optimisation to skip <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> parts where the part is a
constant expression in the <CODE>WHERE</CODE> part.  Indexes can now be used
even if the <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> doesn't match the index exactly, as long as
all the unused index parts and all the extra <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>

Fixed a bug in <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> where one of the arguments was a function
that returned a modified argument.
<LI>

Fixed a critical bug in <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>, where it updated the header in
the index file when one only checked the table.  This confused the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> daemon if it updated the same table at the same time. Now
the status in the index file is only updated if one uses
<CODE>--update-state</CODE>.  With older <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> versions you should
use <CODE>--read-only</CODE> when only checking tables, if there is the
slightest chance that the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is working on the table at the
same time!

Fixed that <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE> is logged in the update log.

LOTS of patches for Linux Alpha. MySQL now appears to be relatively
stable on Alpha.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> on <CODE>HEAP</CODE> temporary tables to use hashed

Fixed optimiser problem on <CODE>SELECT</CODE> when using many overlapping indexes.
MySQL should now be able to choose keys even better when there
are many keys to choose from.

A new storage engine library (<CODE>MyISAM</CODE>) with a lot of new features.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MyISAM">7.1  <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> Tables</A>.
<LI>

You can create in-memory <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables which are extremely fast for
lookups.
<LI>

Support for big files (63-bit) on OSes that support big files.
<LI>

New function <CODE>LOAD_FILE(filename)</CODE> to get the contents of a file as a
string value.
<LI>

New operator <CODE>&#60;=&#62;</CODE> which will act as <CODE>=</CODE> but will return TRUE
if both arguments are <CODE>NULL</CODE>.  This is useful for comparing changes
between tables.
<LI>

Added the ODBC 3.0 <CODE>EXTRACT(interval FROM datetime)</CODE> function.
<LI>

Columns defined as <CODE>FLOAT(X)</CODE> are not rounded on storage and may be
in scientific notation (1.0 E+10) when retrieved.
<LI>

<CODE>REPLACE</CODE> is now faster than before.
<LI>

Changed <CODE>LIKE</CODE> character comparison to behave as <CODE>=</CODE>;
This means that <CODE>'e' LIKE ''e'</CODE> is now true.  (If the line doesn't
display correctly, the latter 'e' is a French 'e' with a dot above.)

<LI>

New create syntax: <CODE>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...</CODE>
<LI>

Allow creation of <CODE>CHAR(0)</CODE> columns.
<LI>

<CODE>DATE_FORMAT()</CODE> now requires <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> before any format character.
<LI>

<CODE>DELAYED</CODE> is now a reserved word (sorry about that :( ).
<LI>

An example procedure is added: <CODE>analyse</CODE>, file: <TT>`sql_analyse.c'</TT>.
This will describe the data in your query.  Try the following:

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM ...
WHERE ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE([max elements,[max memory]])
</PRE>

This procedure is extremely useful when you want to check the data in your
table!
<LI>

<CODE>BINARY</CODE> cast to force a string to be compared in case-sensitive fashion.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-show-database</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Check whether a row has changed in an <CODE>UPDATE</CODE> now also works
with <CODE>BLOB</CODE>/<CODE>TEXT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Added the <CODE>INNER</CODE> join syntax.  <STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>:  This made <CODE>INNER</CODE>
a reserved word!
<LI>

Added support for netmasks to the hostname in the MySQL grant tables.
You can specify a netmask using the <CODE>IP/NETMASK</CODE> syntax.
<LI>

If you compare a <CODE>NOT NULL DATE/DATETIME</CODE> column with <CODE>IS
NULL</CODE>, this is changed to a compare against <CODE>0</CODE> to satisfy some ODBC
applications.  (By <a HREF="mailto:shreeve@uci.edu">shreeve@uci.edu</a>.)
<LI>

<CODE>NULL IN (...)</CODE> now returns <CODE>NULL</CODE> instead of <CODE>0</CODE>.  This will
ensure that <CODE>null_column NOT IN (...)</CODE> doesn't match
<CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Fix storage of floating-point values in <CODE>TIME</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Changed parsing of <CODE>TIME</CODE> strings to be more strict.  Now the
fractional second part is detected (and currently skipped). The
following formats are supported:

<UL>
<LI>[[DAYS] [H]H:]MM:]SS[.fraction]

<LI>[[[[[H]H]H]H]MM]SS[.fraction]

</UL>

<LI>

Detect (and ignore) fractional second part from <CODE>DATETIME</CODE>.

<LI>

Some small changes to the join table optimiser to make some joins faster.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> is much faster; it uses the new <CODE>UNIQUE</CODE>
functionality in <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>. One difference compared to MySQL Version 3.22
is that the output of <CODE>DISTINCT</CODE> is not sorted anymore.
<LI>

All C client API macros are now functions to make shared libraries more
reliable. Because of this, you can no longer call <CODE>mysql_num_fields()</CODE> on
a <CODE>MYSQL</CODE> object, you must use <CODE>mysql_field_count()</CODE> instead.
<LI>

Added use of <CODE>LIBWRAP</CODE>; patch by Henning P. Schmiedehausen.
<LI>

Don't allow <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> for other than numerical columns.
<LI>

Using <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> will now automatically make the column
<CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

Show <CODE>NULL</CODE> as the default value for <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> columns.
<LI>

Added <CODE>SQL_BIG_RESULT</CODE>; <CODE>SQL_SMALL_RESULT</CODE> is now default.

Upgraded <CODE>readline</CODE> to 4.0.
<LI>

New <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> options: <CODE>PACK_KEYS</CODE> and <CODE>CHECKSUM</CODE>.

The 3.22 version has faster and safer connect code than version 3.21, as well

<CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>DATE</CODE> keys.
<LI>

Changed optimiser to make it better at deciding when to do a full join
and when using keys.
<LI>

You can now use <CODE>mysqladmin proc</CODE> to display information about your own
threads. Only users with the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege can get
information about all threads.
(In 4.0.2 one needs the <CODE>SUPER</CODE> privilege for this.)
<LI>

Added handling of formats <CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>, <CODE>YYYYMMDD</CODE>,
<CODE>YYMMDDHHMMSS</CODE> for numbers when using <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> and
<CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE> types. (Formerly these formats only worked with strings.)
<LI>

Added connect option <CODE>CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE</CODE> to allow use of spaces
after function names and before <SAMP>`('</SAMP> (Powerbuilder requires this).
This will make all function names reserved words.
<LI>

Added the <CODE>--log-long-format</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to enable timestamps
and INSERT_ID's in the update log.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--where</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> (patch by Jim Faucette).

<LI>

All table lock handing is changed to avoid some very subtle
deadlocks when using <CODE>DROP TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE FROM
TABLE</CODE> and <CODE>mysqladmin flush-tables</CODE> under heavy usage.
Changed locking code to get better handling of locks of different types.
<LI>

Updated <CODE>DBI</CODE> to 1.00 and <CODE>DBD</CODE> to 1.2.0.
<LI>

Added a check that the error message file contains error messages suitable for
the current version of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>. (To avoid errors if you accidentally
try to use an old error message file.)
<LI>

All count structures in the client (<CODE>affected_rows()</CODE>,
<CODE>insert_id()</CODE>, ...) are now of type <CODE>BIGINT</CODE> to allow 64-bit values
to be used.
This required a minor change in the MySQL protocol which should affect
only old clients when using tables with <CODE>AUTO_INCREMENT</CODE> values &#62; 16M.
<LI>

The return type of <CODE>mysql_fetch_lengths()</CODE> has changed from <CODE>uint *</CODE>
to <CODE>ulong *</CODE>. This may give a warning for old clients but should work
on most machines.
<LI>

Change <CODE>mysys</CODE> and <CODE>dbug</CODE> libraries to allocate all thread variables
in one struct.  This makes it easier to make a threaded <TT>`libmysql.dll'</TT>
library.
<LI>

Use the result from <CODE>gethostname()</CODE> (instead of <CODE>uname()</CODE>) when
constructing <TT>`.pid'</TT> file names.

New better compressed server/client protocol.
<LI>

<CODE>COUNT()</CODE>, <CODE>STD()</CODE> and <CODE>AVG()</CODE> are extended to handle more than
4G rows.

You can now store values in the range <CODE>-838:59:59</CODE> &#60;= x &#60;=
<CODE>838:59:59</CODE> in a <CODE>TIME</CODE> column.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: incompatible change!!</STRONG>
If you set a <CODE>TIME</CODE> column to too short a value, MySQL now
assumes the value is given as: <CODE>[[[D ]HH:]MM:]SS</CODE> instead of
<CODE>HH[:MM[:SS]]</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>TIME_TO_SEC()</CODE> and <CODE>SEC_TO_TIME()</CODE> can now handle negative times
and hours up to 32767.

Added new option
<CODE>SET SQL_LOG_UPDATE={0|1}</CODE> to allow users with
the <CODE>PROCESS</CODE> privilege to bypass the update log.
(Modified patch from Sergey A Mukhin <a HREF="mailto:violet@rosnet.net">violet@rosnet.net</a>.)
<LI>

Fixed fatal bug in <CODE>LPAD()</CODE>.
<LI>

Initialise line buffer in <TT>`mysql.cc'</TT> to make <CODE>BLOB</CODE> reading from
pipes safer.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O max_connect_errors=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
Connect errors are now reset for each correct connection.
<LI>

Increased the default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> to <CODE>1M</CODE> in
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--low-priority-updates</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to give
table-modifying operations (<CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>REPLACE</CODE>, <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>,
<CODE>DELETE</CODE>) lower priority than retrievals.  You can now use
<CODE>{INSERT | REPLACE | UPDATE | DELETE} LOW_PRIORITY ...</CODE> You can
also use <CODE>SET SQL_LOW_PRIORITY_UPDATES={0|1}</CODE> to change
the priority for one thread.  One side effect is that <CODE>LOW_PRIORITY</CODE>
is now a reserved word. :(
<LI>

Add support for <CODE>INSERT INTO table ... VALUES(...),(...),(...)</CODE>,
to allow inserting multiple rows with a single statement.
<LI>

<CODE>INSERT INTO tbl_name</CODE> is now also cached when used with <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE>.
(Previously only <CODE>INSERT ... SELECT</CODE> and <CODE>LOAD DATA INFILE</CODE> were
cached.)
<LI>

Allow <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> functions with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT col FROM table GROUP BY col HAVING COUNT(*)&#62;0;
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> will now ignore trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> characters in queries. This
is to make it easier to migrate from some other SQL servers that require the
trailing <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>.
<LI>

Fix for corrupted fixed-format output generated by <CODE>SELECT INTO OUTFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: incompatible change!</STRONG>
Added Oracle <CODE>GREATEST()</CODE> and <CODE>LEAST()</CODE> functions.  You must now use
these instead of the <CODE>MAX()</CODE> and <CODE>MIN()</CODE> functions to get the
largest/smallest value from a list of values. These can now handle <CODE>REAL</CODE>,
<CODE>BIGINT</CODE> and string (<CODE>CHAR</CODE> or <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>) values.
<LI>

<STRONG>Warning: incompatible change!</STRONG>
<CODE>DAYOFWEEK()</CODE> had offset 0 for Sunday. Changed the offset to 1.
<LI>

Give an error for queries that mix <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> columns and fields when
there is no <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> specification.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--vertical</CODE> option to <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for printing results in
vertical mode.

Index-only optimisation; some queries are now resolved using
only indexes.  Until MySQL 4.0, this works only for numeric columns.

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL

<PRE>
SELECT ... FROM table WHERE auto_increment_column == LAST_INSERT_ID()

<UL>
<LI>

Added new C API function <CODE>mysql_ping()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new API functions <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> and <CODE>mysql_options()</CODE>.
You now MUST call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> before you call
<CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE>.
You don't have to call <CODE>mysql_init()</CODE> if you only use
<CODE>mysql_connect()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>mysql_options(...,MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT,...)</CODE> so you can set a

<LI>

Added <CODE>--timeout</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>, as a test of

Added <CODE>AFTER column</CODE> and <CODE>FIRST</CODE> options to
<CODE>ALTER TABLE ... ADD columns</CODE>.
This makes it possible to add a new column at some specific location

<CODE>WEEK()</CODE> assumes the week starts on Sunday.
<LI>

<CODE>TIME</CODE> columns weren't stored properly (bug in MySQL Version 3.22.0).

<UL>
<LI>

New (backward-compatible) connect protocol that allows you to
specify the database to use when connecting, to get much faster
connections to a specific database.

The <CODE>mysql_real_connect()</CODE> call is changed to:


<PRE>
mysql_real_connect(MYSQL *mysql, const char *host, const char *user,
                   const char *passwd, const char *db, uint port,
                   const char *unix_socket, uint client_flag)
</PRE>

<LI>

Each connection is handled by its own thread, rather than by the
master <CODE>accept()</CODE> thread.  This fixes permanently the telnet bug
that was a topic on the mail list some time ago.
<LI>

All TCP/IP connections are now checked with backward-resolution of
the hostname to get better security. <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now has a local hostname
resolver cache so connections should actually be faster than before,
even with this feature.
<LI>

A site automatically will be blocked from future connections if someone
repeatedly connects with an ``improper header'' (like when one uses telnet).
<LI>

You can now refer to tables in different databases with references of the form
<CODE>tbl_name@db_name</CODE> or <CODE>db_name.tbl_name</CODE>.  This makes it possible to
give a user read access to some tables and write access to others simply by
keeping them in different databases!
<LI>

Added <CODE>--user</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to allow it to run
as another Unix user (if it is started as the Unix <CODE>root</CODE> user).
<LI>

Added caching of users and access rights (for faster access rights checking)
<LI>

Normal users (not anonymous ones) can change their password with
<CODE>mysqladmin password 'new_password'</CODE>.  This uses encrypted passwords
that are not logged in the normal MySQL log!
<LI>

All important string functions are now coded in assembler for x86 Linux
machines.  This gives a speedup of 10% in many cases.
<LI>

For tables that have many columns, the column names are now hashed for
much faster column name lookup (this will speed up some benchmark
tests a lot!)
<LI>

Some benchmarks are changed to get better individual timing.
(Some loops were so short that a specific test took &#60; 2 seconds. The
loops have been changed to take about 20 seconds to make it easier
to compare different databases. A test that took 1-2 seconds before
now takes 11-24 seconds, which is much better)
<LI>

Re-arranged <CODE>SELECT</CODE> code to handle some very specific queries
involving group functions (like <CODE>COUNT(*)</CODE>) without a <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> but
with <CODE>HAVING</CODE>. The following now works:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT COUNT(*) as C FROM table HAVING C &#62; 1;
</PRE>

<LI>

Changed the protocol for field functions to be faster and avoid some
calls to <CODE>malloc()</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-T32</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, for running all queries under the
main thread.  This makes it possible to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under Linux with
<CODE>gdb</CODE>!
<LI>

Added optimisation of <CODE>not_null_column IS NULL</CODE> (needed for some Access
queries).
<LI>

Allow <CODE>STRAIGHT_JOIN</CODE> to be used between two tables to force the optimiser
to join them in a specific order.
<LI>

String functions now return <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> rather than <CODE>CHAR</CODE> and
the column type is now <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE> for fields saved as <CODE>VARCHAR</CODE>.
This should make the <CODE>MyODBC</CODE> driver better, but may break some old
MySQL clients that don't handle <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VARCHAR</CODE> the same
way as <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> are now implemented through
<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE>.
<CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE> is still the recommended (fast) way to create indexes.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--set-variable</CODE> option <CODE>wait_timeout</CODE> to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added time column to <CODE>mysqladmin processlist</CODE> to show how long a query
has taken or how long a thread has slept.
<LI>

Added lots of new variables to <CODE>show variables</CODE> and some new to
<CODE>show status</CODE>.
<LI>

Added new type <CODE>YEAR</CODE>. <CODE>YEAR</CODE> is stored in 1 byte with allowable
values of 0, and 1901 to 2155.
<LI>

Added new <CODE>DATE</CODE> type that is stored in 3 bytes rather than 4 bytes.
All new tables are created with the new date type if you don't use the
<CODE>--old-protocol</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed bug in record caches; for some queries, you could get
<CODE>Error from table handler: #</CODE> on some operating systems.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--enable-assembler</CODE> option to <CODE>configure</CODE>, for x86 machines
(tested on Linux + <CODE>gcc</CODE>).  This will enable assembler functions for the
most important string functions for more speed!

if the returned string should be longer than <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> bytes.
<LI>

Changed the name of the <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> type to <CODE>ENUM</CODE>, because
<CODE>INTERVAL</CODE> is used in ANSI SQL.

Lots of changes for Windows 95 port. In theory, this version should now be
easily portable to Windows 95.
<LI>

Changed the <CODE>CREATE COLUMN</CODE> syntax of <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> columns to be after
the <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> value, as specified in the ANSI SQL standard. This will
make <CODE>mysqldump</CODE> with <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE> and default values incompatible with

<LI>

Added the beginnings of a benchmark suite.
<LI>

Added more secure password handling.
<LI>

Added new client function <CODE>mysql_errno()</CODE>, to get the error number of
the error message. This makes error checking in the client much easier.
This makes the new server incompatible with the 3.20.x server when running

<UL>
<LI>

Added reverse check lookup of hostnames to get better security.
<LI>

Fixed some possible buffer overflows if filenames that are too long are used.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't accept hostnames that start with digits followed by a
<CODE>'.'</CODE>, because the hostname may look like an IP number.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--skip-networking</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to allow only socket
connections.  (This will not work with MIT-pthreads!)
<LI>

Added check of too long table names for alias.
<LI>

Added check if database name is okay.
<LI>

Added check if too long table names.
<LI>

Removed incorrect <CODE>free()</CODE> that killed the server on
<CODE>CREATE DATABASE</CODE> or <CODE>DROP DATABASE</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed some <CODE>mysqld</CODE> <CODE>-O</CODE> options to better names.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O join_cache_size=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O max_join_size=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to be able to set a
limit how big queries (in this case big = slow) one should be able to handle
without specifying <CODE>SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1</CODE>.  A # = is about 10
examined records. The default is ``unlimited''.
<LI>

When comparing a <CODE>TIME</CODE>, <CODE>DATE</CODE>, <CODE>DATETIME</CODE> or <CODE>TIMESTAMP</CODE>
column to a constant, the constant is converted to a time value before
performing the comparison.
This will make it easier to get ODBC (particularly Access97) to work with
the above types. It should also make dates easier to use and the comparisons
should be quicker than before.
<LI>

Applied patch from Jochen Wiedmann that allows <CODE>query()</CODE> in
<CODE>mysqlperl</CODE> to take a query with <CODE>\0</CODE> in it.
<LI>

Storing a timestamp with a 2-digit year (<CODE>YYMMDD</CODE>) didn't work.

Now the automatic timestamp field is the FIRST timestamp field.
<LI>

<CODE>SELECT * INTO OUTFILE</CODE>, which didn't correctly if the outfile already
existed.
<LI>

<CODE>mysql</CODE> now shows the thread ID when starting or doing a reconnect.
<LI>

Changed the default sort buffer size from 2M to 1M.

<LI>

More portable. Should compile on AIX and alpha-digital.
At least the <CODE>isam</CODE> library should be relatively 64-bit clean.

Better checking of pthread(s) library.
<LI>

czech error messages by <a HREF="mailto:snajdr@pvt.net">snajdr@pvt.net</a>.
<LI>

Decreased size of some buffers to get fewer problems on systems with little
memory.  Also added more checks to handle ``out of memory'' problems.
<LI>

<CODE>mysqladmin</CODE>: you can now do <CODE>mysqladmin kill 5,6,7,8</CODE> to kill
multiple threads.
<LI>

When the maximum connection limit is reached, one extra connection by a user
with the <STRONG>process_acl</STRONG> privilege is granted.
<LI>

Added <CODE>-O backlog=#</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
<LI>

Increased maximum packet size from 512K to 1024K for client.
<LI>

Almost all of the function code is now tested in the internal test suite.
<LI>

<CODE>ALTER TABLE</CODE> now returns warnings from field conversions.
<LI>

Port changed to 3306 (got it reserved from ISI).
<LI>

Added a fix for Visual FoxBase so that any schema name from a table
specification is automatically removed.
<LI>

New function <CODE>ASCII()</CODE>.
<LI>

Removed function <CODE>BETWEEN(a,b,c)</CODE>. Use the standard ANSI
syntax instead: <CODE>expr BETWEEN expr AND expr</CODE>.
<LI>

MySQL no longer has to use an extra temporary table when sorting
on functions or <CODE>SUM()</CODE> functions.
<LI>

Fixed bug that you couldn't use <CODE>tbl_name.field_name</CODE> in <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed <CODE>SELECT DISTINCT</CODE> when using 'hidden group'. For example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT DISTINCT MOD(some_field,10) FROM test
    -&#62;        GROUP BY some_field;
</PRE>

Note: <CODE>some_field</CODE> is normally in the <CODE>SELECT</CODE> part. ANSI SQL should
require it.

<UL>
<LI>

New reserved words used: <CODE>INTERVAL</CODE>, <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>, <CODE>READ</CODE>,
<CODE>WRITE</CODE>, <CODE>BINARY</CODE>.
<LI>

Added ODBC function <CODE>CHAR(num,...)</CODE>.
<LI>

New operator <CODE>IN</CODE>. This uses a binary search to find a match.
<LI>

New command <CODE>LOCK TABLES tbl_name [AS alias] {READ|WRITE} ...</CODE>
<LI>

Added <CODE>--log-update</CODE> option to <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, to get a log suitable for
incremental updates.
<LI>

New command <CODE>EXPLAIN SELECT ...</CODE> to get information about how the
optimiser will do the join.
<LI>

For easier client code, the client should no longer use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY_BLOB</CODE>, <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_MEDIUM_BLOB</CODE>,
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_LONG_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_VAR_STRING</CODE> (as
previously returned by <CODE>mysql_list_fields</CODE>).  You should instead only use
<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_BLOB</CODE> or <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_STRING</CODE>.  If you want exact
types, you should use the command <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
<LI>

Added varbinary syntax: <CODE>0x######</CODE> which can be used as a string
(default) or a number.
<LI>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> is renamed to <CODE>FIELD_TYPE_TINY</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed all fields to C++ classes.
<LI>

Removed FORM struct.
<LI>

Fields with <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> values no longer need to be <CODE>NOT NULL</CODE>.
<LI>

New field types:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ENUM</CODE>
<DD>
A string which can take only a couple of defined values. The value is
stored as a 1-3 byte number that is mapped automatically to a string.
This is sorted according to string positions!
<DT><CODE>SET</CODE>
<DD>
A string which may have one or many string values separated with ','.
The string is stored as a 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-byte number where each bit stands
for a specific set member.  This is sorted according to the unsigned value
of the stored packed number.
</DL>
<LI>

Now all function calculation is done with <CODE>double</CODE> or <CODE>long long</CODE>.
This will provide the full 64-bit range with bit functions and fix some
conversions that previously could result in precision losses.  One should
avoid using <CODE>unsigned long long</CODE> columns with full 64-bit range
(numbers bigger than 9223372036854775807) because calculations are done
with <CODE>signed long long</CODE>.
<LI>

<CODE>ORDER BY</CODE> will now put <CODE>NULL</CODE> field values first. <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE>
will also work with <CODE>NULL</CODE> values.
<LI>

Full <CODE>WHERE</CODE> with expressions.
<LI>

New range optimiser that can resolve ranges when some keypart prefix is
constant. Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT * FROM tbl_name
    -&#62;          WHERE key_part_1="customer"
    -&#62;          AND key_part_2&#62;=10 AND key_part_2&#60;=10;

The <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server is now compiled by default without debugging
information.  This will make the daemon smaller and faster.
<LI>

Now one usually only has to specify the <CODE>--basedir</CODE> option to
<CODE>mysqld</CODE>. All other paths are relative in a normal installation.
<LI>

<CODE>BLOB</CODE> columns sometimes contained garbage when used with a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
on more than one table and <CODE>ORDER BY</CODE>.
<LI>

Fixed that calculations that are not in <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> work as expected

Example:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT id,id+1 FROM table GROUP BY id;

Arithmetic error on SPARC-386.
<LI>

Added <CODE>--unbuffered</CODE> option to <CODE>mysql</CODE>, for new <CODE>mysqlaccess</CODE>.

All communication packets and row buffers are now allocated dynamically
on demand. The default value of <CODE>max_allowed_packet</CODE> is now 64K for

The following now works:

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT filter_nr,filter_nr FROM filter ORDER BY filter_nr;

<LI>

<CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> and <CODE>mysql.server</CODE> changed to be more compatible
between the source and the binary releases.
<LI>

<CODE>LIMIT</CODE> now takes one or two numeric arguments.
If one argument is given, it indicates the maximum number of rows in
a result. If two arguments are given, the first argument indicates the offset
of the first row to return, the second is the maximum number of rows.
With this it's easy to do a poor man's next page/previous page WWW
application.

Changed name of SQL function <CODE>FIELDS()</CODE> to <CODE>ELT()</CODE>.
Changed SQL function <CODE>INTERVALL()</CODE> to <CODE>INTERVAL()</CODE>.
<LI>

Made <CODE>SHOW COLUMNS</CODE> a synonym for <CODE>SHOW FIELDS</CODE>.
Added compatibility syntax <CODE>FRIEND KEY</CODE> to <CODE>CREATE TABLE</CODE>. In
MySQL, this creates a non-unique key on the given columns.
<LI>

Added <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> and <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> as compatibility functions.
In MySQL, <CODE>CREATE INDEX</CODE> only checks if the index exists and
issues an error if it doesn't exist. <CODE>DROP INDEX</CODE> always succeeds.
<LI>

<TT>`mysqladmin.c'</TT>: added client version to version information.
<LI>

Fixed core dump bug in <CODE>sql_acl</CODE> (core on new connection).
<LI>

Removed <CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>user</CODE> and <CODE>db</CODE> tables from database <CODE>test</CODE>

<CODE>FIELD_TYPE_CHAR</CODE> can now be signed (-128 to 127) or unsigned (0 to 255)
Previously, it was always unsigned.
<LI>

Bug fixes in <CODE>CONCAT()</CODE> and <CODE>WEEKDAY()</CODE>.
<LI>

Changed a lot of source to get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to be compiled with SunPro
compiler.
<LI>

SQL functions must now have a <CODE>'('</CODE> immediately after the function name
(no intervening space).
For example, <CODE>'USER('</CODE> is regarded as beginning a function call, and
<CODE>'USER ('</CODE> is regarded as an identifier <CODE>USER</CODE> followed by a
<CODE>'('</CODE>, not as a function call.

This appendix will help you port MySQL to other operationg systems.
Do check the list of currently supported operating systems first.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Which_OS">2.2.5  Operating Systems Supported by MySQL</A>.
If you have created a new port of MySQL, please let us know so that
we can list it here and on our web site (<a HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>),
recommending it to other users.

</P>
<P>
Note: If you create a new port of MySQL, you are free to copy and
distribute it under the GPL license, but it does not make you a
copyright holder of MySQL.

</P>
<P>
A working Posix thread library is needed for the server. On Solaris 2.5
we use Sun PThreads (the native thread support in 2.4 and earlier
versions are not good enough) and on Linux we use LinuxThreads by Xavier
Leroy, <a HREF="mailto:Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr">Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr</a>.

</P>
<P>
The hard part of porting to a new Unix variant without good native
thread support is probably to port MIT-pthreads. See
<TT>`mit-pthreads/README'</TT> and Programming POSIX Threads
(<a HREF="http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/">http://www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/</a>).

</P>
<P>
The MySQL distribution includes a patched version of
Provenzano's Pthreads from MIT (see the MIT Pthreads web page at
<a HREF="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html">http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html</a>).
This can be used for some operating systems that do not
have POSIX threads.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use another user level thread package named
FSU Pthreads (see
<a HREF="http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~mueller/pthreads.html"> FSU Pthreads
home page</a>). This implementation is being used for the SCO port.

</P>
<P>
See the <TT>`thr_lock.c'</TT> and <TT>`thr_alarm.c'</TT> programs in the <TT>`mysys'</TT>
directory for some tests/examples of these problems.

</P>
<P>
Both the server and the client need a working C++ compiler (we use <CODE>gcc</CODE>
and have tried SPARCworks). Another compiler that is known to work is the
Irix <CODE>cc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To compile only the client use <CODE>./configure --without-server</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There is currently no support for only compiling the server, nor is it
likly to be added unless someone has a good reason for it.

</P>
<P>
If you want/need to change any <TT>`Makefile'</TT> or the configure script you must
get Automake and Autoconf. We have used the <CODE>automake-1.2</CODE> and

If you run into problems with a new port, you may have to do some debugging
of MySQL!
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Debugging_server">E.1  Debugging a MySQL server</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: before you start debugging <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, first get the test
programs <CODE>mysys/thr_alarm</CODE> and <CODE>mysys/thr_lock</CODE> to work.  This
will ensure that your thread installation has even a remote chance to work!

If you are using some functionality that is very new in MySQL,
you can try to run <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-new</CODE> (which will disable all
new, potentially unsafe functionality) or with <CODE>--safe-mode</CODE> which
disables a lot of optimisation that may cause problems.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> doesn't want to start, you should check that you don't have
any <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> files that interfere with your setup!
You can check your <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> arguments with <CODE>mysqld --print-defaults</CODE>
and avoid using them by starting with <CODE>mysqld --no-defaults ...</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> starts to eat up CPU or memory or if it ``hangs'', you
can use <CODE>mysqladmin processlist status</CODE> to find out if someone is
executing a query that takes a long time.  It may be a good idea to
run <CODE>mysqladmin -i10 processlist status</CODE> in some window if you are
experiencing performance problems or problems when new clients can't connect.

</P>
<P>
The command <CODE>mysqladmin debug</CODE> will dump some information about
locks in use, used memory and query usage to the mysql log file. This
may help solve some problems.  This command also provides some useful
information even if you haven't compiled MySQL for debugging!

</P>
<P>
If the problem is that some tables are getting slower and slower you
should try to optimise the table with <CODE>OPTIMIZE TABLE</CODE> or
<CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>. You should also
check the slow queries with <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
You should also read the OS-specific section in this manual for
problems that may be unique to your environment.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Operating_System_Specific_Notes">2.6  Operating System Specific Notes</A>.

<H3><A NAME="Compiling_for_debugging" HREF="manual_toc.html#Compiling_for_debugging">E.1.1  Compiling MYSQL for Debugging</A></H3>

<P>
If you have some very specific problem, you can always try to debug
MySQL.  To do this you must configure MySQL with the
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE> or the <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE> option.  You can check
whether MySQL was compiled with debugging by doing:
<CODE>mysqld --help</CODE>.  If the <CODE>--debug</CODE> flag is listed with the
options then you have debugging enabled.  <CODE>mysqladmin ver</CODE> also
lists the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> version as <CODE>mysql ... --debug</CODE> in this case.

</P>
<P>
If you are using gcc or egcs, the recommended configure line is:

</P>

<PRE>
CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O2" CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-O2 -felide-constructors \
   -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql \
   --with-debug --with-extra-charsets=complex
</PRE>

<P>
This will avoid problems with the <CODE>libstdc++</CODE> library and with C++
exceptions (many compilers have problems with C++ exceptions in threaded
code) and compile a MySQL version with support for all character sets.

</P>
<P>
If you suspect a memory overrun error, you can configure MySQL
with <CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>, which will install a memory allocation
(<CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE>) checker. Running with <CODE>SAFEMALLOC</CODE> is however
quite slow, so if you get performance problems you should start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--skip-safemalloc</CODE> option. This will
disable the memory overrun checks for each call to <CODE>malloc</CODE> and
<CODE>free</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> stops crashing when you compile it with
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>, you have probably found a compiler bug or a timing
bug within MySQL.  In this case you can try to add <CODE>-g</CODE> to
the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> variables above and not use
<CODE>--with-debug</CODE>. If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> now dies, you can at least attach
to it with <CODE>gdb</CODE> or use <CODE>gdb</CODE> on the core file to find out
what happened.

</P>
<P>
When you configure MySQL for debugging you automatically enable a
lot of extra safety check functions that monitor the health of <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.
If they find something ``unexpected,'' an entry will be written to
<CODE>stderr</CODE>, which <CODE>safe_mysqld</CODE> directs to the error log!  This also
means that if you are having some unexpected problems with MySQL and
are using a source distribution, the first thing you should do is to
configure MySQL for debugging!  (The second thing, of course, is to
send mail to <a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a> and ask for help.  Please use the
<CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> script for all bug reports or questions regarding the
MySQL version you are using!

In the Windows MySQL distribution, <CODE>mysqld.exe</CODE> is by
default compiled with support for trace files.

<P>
If the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server doesn't start or if you can cause the
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server to crash quickly, you can try to create a trace
file to find the problem.

</P>
<P>
To do this you have to have a <CODE>mysqld</CODE> that is compiled for debugging.
You can check this by executing <CODE>mysqld -V</CODE>.  If the version number
ends with <CODE>-debug</CODE>, it's compiled with support for trace files.

</P>
<P>
Start the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with a trace log in <TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>
(or <TT>`C:\mysqld.trace'</TT> on Windows):

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug</CODE>

</P>
<P>
On Windows you should also use the <CODE>--standalone</CODE> flag to not start
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> as a service:

</P>
<P>
In a DOS window do:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld --debug --standalone
</PRE>

<P>
After this you can use the <CODE>mysql.exe</CODE> command-line tool in a
second DOS window to reproduce the problem. You can take down the above
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> server with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that the trace file will get <STRONG>very big</STRONG>!
If you want to have a smaller trace file, you can use something like:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>mysqld --debug=d,info,error,query,general,where:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace</CODE>

</P>
<P>
which only prints information with the most interesting tags in
<TT>`/tmp/mysqld.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you make a bug report about this, please only send the lines from the
trace file to the appropriate mailing list where something seems to go
wrong! If you can't locate the wrong place, you can ftp the trace file,
together with a full bug report, to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a> so that a MySQL
developer can take a look a this.

</P>
<P>
On most systems you can also start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> from <CODE>gdb</CODE> to get
more information if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> crashes.

</P>
<P>
With some older <CODE>gdb</CODE> versions on Linux you must use <CODE>run
--one-thread</CODE> if you want to be able to debug <CODE>mysqld</CODE> threads.  In
this case you can only have one thread active at a time.  We recommend you
to upgrade to gdb 5.1 ASAP as thread debugging works much better with this
version!

</P>
<P>
When running <CODE>mysqld</CODE> under gdb, you should disable the stack trace
with <CODE>--skip-stack-trace</CODE> to be able to catch segfaults within gdb.

</P>
<P>
It's very hard to debug MySQL under <CODE>gdb</CODE> if you do a lot of
new connections the whole time as <CODE>gdb</CODE> doesn't free the memory for
old threads.  You can avoid this problem by starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>-O thread_cache_size= 'max_connections +1'</CODE>.  In most cases just
using <CODE>-O thread_cache_size=5'</CODE> will help a lot!

</P>
<P>
If you want to get a core dump on Linux if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies with a
SIGSEGV signal, you can start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>--core-file</CODE> option.
This core file can be used to make a backtrace that may help you
find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb mysqld core
gdb&#62;   backtrace full
gdb&#62;   exit
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Crashing">A.4.1  What To Do If MySQL Keeps Crashing</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using gdb 4.17.x or above on Linux, you should install a
<TT>`.gdb'</TT> file, with the following information, in your current
directory:

</P>

<PRE>
set print sevenbit off
handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
handle SIGUSR2 nostop noprint
handle SIGWAITING nostop noprint
handle SIGLWP nostop noprint
handle SIGPIPE nostop
handle SIGALRM nostop
handle SIGHUP nostop
handle SIGTERM nostop noprint
</PRE>

<P>
If you have problems debugging threads with gdb, you should download
gdb 5.x and try this instead. The new gdb version has very improved
thread handling!

</P>
<P>
Here is an example how to debug mysqld:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; gdb /usr/local/libexec/mysqld
gdb&#62; run
...
backtrace full # Do this when mysqld crashes
</PRE>

<P>
Include the above output in a mail generated with <CODE>mysqlbug</CODE> and
mail this to <CODE>mysql@lists.mysql.com</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> hangs you can try to use some system tools like
<CODE>strace</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/proc/bin/pstack</CODE> to examine where
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> has hung.

</P>

<PRE>
strace /tmp/log libexec/mysqld

If you are using the Perl <CODE>DBI</CODE> interface, you can turn on
debugging information by using the <CODE>trace</CODE> method or by
setting the <CODE>DBI_TRACE</CODE> environment variable.

<H3><A NAME="Using_stack_trace" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_stack_trace">E.1.4  Using a Stack Trace</A></H3>

<P>
On some operating systems, the error log will contain a stack trace if
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies unexpectedly. You can use this to find out where (and
maybe why) <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Error_log">4.9.1  The Error Log</A>.  To get a stack trace,
you must not compile <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with the <CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE>
option to gcc. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Compiling_for_debugging">E.1.1  Compiling MYSQL for Debugging</A>.

</P>
<P>
If the error file contains something like the following:

</P>

<PRE>
mysqld got signal 11;
The manual section 'Debugging a MySQL server' tells you how to use a
stack trace and/or the core file to produce a readable backtrace that may
help in finding out why mysqld died
Attemping backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died.  If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong
stack range sanity check, ok, backtrace follows
0x40077552
0x81281a0
0x8128f47
0x8127be0

0x80c3c91
0x80c6b43
0x80c1fd9
0x80c1686
</PRE>

<P>
you can find where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died by doing the following:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Copy the above numbers to a file, for example <TT>`mysqld.stack'</TT>.

<LI>

Make a symbol file for the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server:

<PRE>
nm -n libexec/mysqld &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

Note that many MySQL binary distributions comes with the above
file, named <CODE>mysqld.sym.gz</CODE>.  In this case you must unpack this by
doing:

<PRE>
gunzip &#60; bin/mysqld.sym.gz &#62; /tmp/mysqld.sym
</PRE>

<LI>

Execute <CODE>resolve_stack_dump -s /tmp/mysqld.sym -n mysqld.stack</CODE>.

This will print out where <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died. If this doesn't help you
find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died, you should make a bug report and include
the output from the above commend with the bug report.

Note however that in most cases it will not help us to just have a stack
trace to find the reason for the problem.  To be able to locate the bug
or provide a workaround, we would in most cases need to know the query
that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and preferable a test case so that we can
repeat the problem!  See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.
</OL>



<H3><A NAME="Using_log_files" HREF="manual_toc.html#Using_log_files">E.1.5  Using Log Files to Find Cause of Errors in mysqld</A></H3>

<P>
Note that before starting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log</CODE> you should
check all your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies or hangs, you should start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with
<CODE>--log</CODE>.  When <CODE>mysqld</CODE> dies again, you can examine the end of
the log file for the query that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you are using <CODE>--log</CODE> without a file name, the log is stored in
the database directory as 'hostname'.log In most cases it's the last
query in the log file that killed <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, but if possible you
should verify this by restarting <CODE>mysqld</CODE> and executing the found
query from the <CODE>mysql</CODE> command-line tools. If this works, you
should also test all complicated queries that didn't complete.

</P>
<P>
You can also try the command <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> on all <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements that takes a long time to ensure that <CODE>mysqld</CODE> is using
indexes properly. See section <A HREF="manual.html#EXPLAIN">5.2.1  <CODE>EXPLAIN</CODE> Syntax (Get Information About a <CODE>SELECT</CODE>)</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can find the queries that take a long time to execute by starting
<CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log-slow-queries</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Slow_query_log">4.9.5  The Slow Query Log</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you find the text <CODE>mysqld restarted</CODE> in the error log file
(normally named <TT>`hostname.err'</TT>) you have probably found a query
that causes <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to fail.  If this happens you should check all
your tables with <CODE>myisamchk</CODE> (see section <A HREF="manual.html#MySQL_Database_Administration">4  Database Administration</A>),
and test the queries in the MySQL log files to see if one doesn't
work.  If you find such a query, try first upgrading to the newest
MySQL version.  If this doesn't help and you can't find anything
in the <CODE>mysql</CODE> mail archive, you should report the bug to
<a HREF="mailto:mysql@lists.mysql.com">mysql@lists.mysql.com</a>.  Links to mail archives are available
online at <a HREF="http://lists.mysql.com/">http://lists.mysql.com/</a>.

</P>
<P>
If you have started <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>myisam-recover</CODE>,
MySQL will automatically check and try to repair <CODE>MyISAM</CODE>
tables if they are marked as 'not closed properly' or 'crashed'.  If
this happens, MySQL will write an entry in the
<CODE>hostname.err</CODE> file <CODE>'Warning: Checking table ...'</CODE> which is
followed by <CODE>Warning: Repairing table</CODE> if the table needs to be
repaired.  If you get a lot of these errors, without <CODE>mysqld</CODE> having
died unexpectedly just before, then something is wrong and needs to
be investigated further. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Command-line_options">4.1.1  <CODE>mysqld</CODE> Command-line Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
It's of course not a good sign if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> did died unexpectedly,
but in this case one shouldn't investigate the <CODE>Checking table...</CODE>
messages but instead try to find out why <CODE>mysqld</CODE> died.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="Reproduceable_test_case" HREF="manual_toc.html#Reproduceable_test_case">E.1.6  Making a Test Case When You Experience Table Corruption</A></H3>

<P>
If you get corrupted tables or if <CODE>mysqld</CODE> always fails after some
update commands, you can test if this bug is reproducible by doing the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Take down the MySQL daemon (with <CODE>mysqladmin shutdown</CODE>).
<LI>

Make a backup of the tables (to guard against the very unlikely case that
the repair will do something bad).
<LI>

Check all tables with <CODE>myisamchk -s database/*.MYI</CODE>.  Repair any
wrong tables with <CODE>myisamchk -r database/table.MYI</CODE>.
<LI>

Make a second backup of the tables.
<LI>

Remove (or move away) any old log files from the MySQL data
directory if you need more space.
<LI>

Start <CODE>mysqld</CODE> with <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Binary_log">4.9.4  The Binary Update Log</A>.
If you want to find a query that crashes <CODE>mysqld</CODE>, you should use
<CODE>--log --log-bin</CODE>.
<LI>

When you have gotten a crashed table, stop the <CODE>mysqld server</CODE>.
<LI>

Restore the backup.
<LI>

Restart the <CODE>mysqld</CODE> server <STRONG>without</STRONG> <CODE>--log-bin</CODE>
<LI>

Re-execute the commands with <CODE>mysqlbinlog update-log-file | mysql</CODE>.
The update log is saved in the MySQL database directory with
the name <CODE>hostname-bin.#</CODE>.
<LI>

If the tables are corrupted again or you can get <CODE>mysqld</CODE> to die with the
above command, you have found reproducible bug that should be easy to
fix! FTP the tables and the binary log to
<a HREF="ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/">ftp://support.mysql.com/pub/mysql/secret/</a> and send a mail to
<a HREF="mailto:bugs@lists.mysql.com">bugs@lists.mysql.com</a> or (if you are a support customer) to
<a HREF="mailto:support@mysql.com">support@mysql.com</a> about the problem and the MySQL team
will fix it as soon as possible.
</UL>

<P>
You can also use the script <CODE>mysql_find_rows</CODE> to just execute some of the
update statements if you want to narrow down the problem.

<H2><A NAME="Debugging_client" HREF="manual_toc.html#Debugging_client">E.2  Debugging a MySQL client</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1872"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1873"></A>

</P>
<P>
To be able to debug a MySQL client with the integrated debug package,
you should configure MySQL with <CODE>--with-debug</CODE> or
<CODE>--with-debug=full</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="manual.html#configure_options">2.3.3  Typical <CODE>configure</CODE> Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1874"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1875"></A>
Before running a client, you should set the <CODE>MYSQL_DEBUG</CODE> environment
variable:

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
shell&#62; export MYSQL_DEBUG
</PRE>

<P>
This causes clients to generate a trace file in <TT>`/tmp/client.trace'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you have problems with your own client code, you should attempt to
connect to the server and run your query using a client that is known to
work.  Do this by running <CODE>mysql</CODE> in debugging mode (assuming you
have compiled MySQL with debugging on):

</P>

<PRE>
shell&#62; mysql --debug=d:t:O,/tmp/client.trace
</PRE>

<P>
This will provide useful information in case you mail a bug report.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Bug_reports">1.6.1.3  How to Report Bugs or Problems</A>.

</P>
<P>
If your client crashes at some 'legal' looking code, you should check
that your <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> include file matches your mysql library file.
A very common mistake is to use an old <TT>`mysql.h'</TT> file from an old
MySQL installation with new MySQL library.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="The_DBUG_package" HREF="manual_toc.html#The_DBUG_package">E.3  The DBUG Package</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1876"></A>

</P>
<P>
The MySQL server and most MySQL clients are compiled
with the DBUG package originally made by Fred Fish.  When one has configured
MySQL for debugging, this package makes it possible to get a trace
file of what the program is debugging. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Making_trace_files">E.1.2  Creating Trace Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
One uses the debug package by invoking the program with the
<CODE>--debug="..."</CODE> or the <CODE>-#...</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Most MySQL programs has a default debug string that will be
used if you don't specify an option to <CODE>--debug</CODE>.  The default
trace file is usually <CODE>/tmp/programname.trace</CODE> on Unix and
<CODE>\programname.trace</CODE> on Windows.

</P>
<P>
The debug control string is a sequence of colon separated fields
as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
&#60;field_1&#62;:&#60;field_2&#62;:...:&#60;field_N&#62;
</PRE>

<P>
Each field consists of a mandatory flag character followed by
an optional "," and comma-separated list of modifiers:

</P>

<PRE>
flag[,modifier,modifier,...,modifier]
</PRE>

<P>
The currently recognised flag characters are:

</P>
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Flag</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>d </TD><TD> Enable output from DBUG_&#60;N&#62; macros for the current state. May be followed by a list of keywords which selects output only for the DBUG macros with that keyword. An empty list of keywords implies output for all macros.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>D </TD><TD> Delay after each debugger output line. The argument is the number of tenths of seconds to delay, subject to machine capabilities. That is, <CODE>-#D,20</CODE> is delay two seconds.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>f </TD><TD> Limit debugging and/or tracing, and profiling to the list of named functions.  Note that a null list will disable all functions.	The appropriate "d" or "t" flags must still be given, this flag only limits their actions if they are enabled.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>F </TD><TD> Identify the source file name for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>i </TD><TD> Identify the process with the pid or thread id for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>g </TD><TD> Enable profiling.  Create a file called 'dbugmon.out' containing information that can be used to profile the program.  May be followed by a list of keywords that select profiling only for the functions in that list.  A null list implies that all functions are considered.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>L </TD><TD> Identify the source file line number for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>n </TD><TD> Print the current function nesting depth for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>N </TD><TD> Number each line of dbug output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>o </TD><TD> Redirect the debugger output stream to the specified file.  The default output is stderr.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>O </TD><TD> As <CODE>O</CODE> but the file is really flushed between each write. When needed the file is closed and reopened between each write.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>p </TD><TD> Limit debugger actions to specified processes. A process must be identified with the DBUG_PROCESS macro and match one in the list for debugger actions to occur.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>P </TD><TD> Print the current process name for each line of debug or trace output.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>r </TD><TD> When pushing a new state, do not inherit the previous state's function nesting level. Useful when the output is to start at the left margin.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S </TD><TD> Do function _sanity(_file_,_line_) at each debugged function until _sanity() returns something that differs from 0. (Mostly used with safemalloc to find memory leaks)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>t </TD><TD> Enable function call/exit trace lines. May be followed by a list (containing only one modifier) giving a numeric maximum trace level, beyond which no output will occur for either debugging or tracing macros.  The default is a compile time option.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Some examples of debug control strings which might appear on a shell
command-line (the "-#" is typically used to introduce a control string
to an application program) are:

</P>

<PRE>
-#d:t
-#d:f,main,subr1:F:L:t,20
-#d,input,output,files:n
-#d:t:i:O,\\mysqld.trace

In MySQL, common tags to print (with the <CODE>d</CODE> option) are:
<CODE>enter</CODE>,<CODE>exit</CODE>,<CODE>error</CODE>,<CODE>warning</CODE>,<CODE>info</CODE> and
<CODE>loop</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="Locking_methods" HREF="manual_toc.html#Locking_methods">E.4  Locking methods</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1877"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1878"></A>

</P>
<P>
Currently MySQL only supports table locking for
<CODE>ISAM</CODE>/<CODE>MyISAM</CODE> and <CODE>HEAP</CODE> tables,
page-level locking for <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables and
row-level locking for <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#Internal_locking">5.3.1  How MySQL Locks Tables</A>.
With <CODE>MyISAM</CODE> tables one can freely mix <CODE>INSERT</CODE> and
<CODE>SELECT</CODE> without locks, if the <CODE>INSERT</CODE>s are non-conflicting
(i.e. whenever they append to the end of the table file rather than
filling freespace from deleted rows/data).

</P>
<P>
Starting in version 3.23.33, you can analyse the table lock contention
on your system by checking <CODE>Table_locks_waited</CODE> and
<CODE>Table_locks_immediate</CODE> environment variables.

</P>
<P>
To decide if you want to use a table type with row-level locking,
you will want to look at what the application does and what the
select/update pattern of the data is.

</P>
<P>
Pros for row locking:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Fewer lock conflicts when accessing different rows in many threads.
<LI>

Fewer changes for rollbacks.
<LI>

Makes it possible to lock a single row a long time.
</UL>

<P>
Cons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Takes more memory than page level or table locks.
<LI>

Is slower than page level or table locks when used on a big part of the table,
because one has to do many more locks.
<LI>

Is definitely much worse than other locks if you do often do <CODE>GROUP
BY</CODE> on a large part of the data or if one has to often scan the whole table.
<LI>

With higher level locks one can also more easily support locks of
different types to tune the application as the lock overhead is less
notable as for row level locks.
</UL>

<P>
Table locks are superior to page level / row level locks in the
following cases:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Mostly reads
<LI>

Read and updates on strict keys; this is where one updates or deletes
a row that can be fetched with one key read:

<PRE>
UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE unique_key#
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE unique_key=#
</PRE>

<LI>

<CODE>SELECT</CODE> combined with <CODE>INSERT</CODE> (and very few <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>s
and <CODE>DELETE</CODE>s).
<LI>

Many scans / <CODE>GROUP BY</CODE> on the whole table without any writers.
</UL>

<P>
Other options than row / page level locking:

</P>
<P>
Versioning (like we use in MySQL for concurrent inserts) where
you can have one writer at the same time as many readers.  This means
that the database/table supports different views for the data depending
on when one started to access it. Other names for this are time travel,
copy on write or copy on demand.

</P>
<P>
Copy on demand is in many case much better than page or row level
locking; the worst case does, however, use much more memory than
when using normal locks.

</P>
<P>
Instead of using row level locks one can use application level locks
(like get_lock/release_lock in MySQL).  This works of course
only in well-behaved applications.

</P>
<P>
In many cases one can do an educated guess which locking type is best
for the application, but generally it's very hard to say that a given
lock type is better than another; everything depends on the application
and different part of the application may require different lock types.

</P>
<P>
Here are some tips about locking in MySQL:

</P>
<P>
Most web applications do lots of selects, very few
deletes, updates mainly on keys, and inserts in some specific tables.
The base MySQL setup is very well tuned for this.

</P>
<P>
Concurrent users are not a problem if one doesn't mix updates with selects
that need to examine many rows in the same table.

</P>
<P>
If one mixes inserts and deletes on the same table then <CODE>INSERT DELAYED</CODE>
may be of great help.

</P>
<P>
One can also use <CODE>LOCK TABLES</CODE> to speed up things (many updates within
a single lock is much faster than updates without locks).  Splitting
thing to different tables will also help.

</P>
<P>
If you get speed problems with the table locks in MySQL, you
may be able to solve these by converting some of your tables to <CODE>InnoDB</CODE>
or <CODE>BDB</CODE> tables.
See section <A HREF="manual.html#InnoDB">7.5  <CODE>InnoDB</CODE> Tables</A>. See section <A HREF="manual.html#BDB">7.6  <CODE>BDB</CODE> or <CODE>BerkeleyDB</CODE> Tables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The optimisation section in the manual covers a lot of different aspects of
how to tune applications. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Tips">5.2.12  Other Optimisation Tips</A>.

<H2><A NAME="RTS-threads" HREF="manual_toc.html#RTS-threads">E.5  Comments about RTS threads</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1879"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1880"></A>

</P>
<P>
I have tried to use the RTS thread packages with MySQL but
stumbled on the following problems:

</P>
<P>
They use an old version of a lot of POSIX calls and it is very tedious to
make wrappers for all functions. I am inclined to think that it would
be easier to change the thread libraries to the newest POSIX
specification.

</P>
<P>
Some wrappers are already written. See <TT>`mysys/my_pthread.c'</TT> for more info.

</P>
<P>
At least the following should be changed:

</P>
<P>
<CODE>pthread_get_specific</CODE> should use one argument.
<CODE>sigwait</CODE> should take two arguments.
A lot of functions (at least <CODE>pthread_cond_wait</CODE>,
<CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait</CODE>)
should return the error code on error. Now they return -1 and set <CODE>errno</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Another problem is that user-level threads use the <CODE>ALRM</CODE> signal and this
aborts a lot of functions (<CODE>read</CODE>, <CODE>write</CODE>, <CODE>open</CODE>...).
MySQL should do a retry on interrupt on all of these but it is
not that easy to verify it.

</P>
<P>
The biggest unsolved problem is the following:

</P>
<P>
To get thread-level alarms I changed <TT>`mysys/thr_alarm.c'</TT> to wait between
alarms with <CODE>pthread_cond_timedwait()</CODE>, but this aborts with error
<CODE>EINTR</CODE>.  I tried to debug the thread library as to why this happens,
but couldn't find any easy solution.

</P>
<P>
If someone wants to try MySQL with RTS threads I suggest the
following:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Change functions MySQL uses from the thread library to POSIX.
This shouldn't take that long.
<LI>

Compile all libraries with the <CODE>-DHAVE_rts_threads</CODE>.
<LI>

Compile <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>.
<LI>

If there are some small differences in the implementation, they may be fixed
by changing <TT>`my_pthread.h'</TT> and <TT>`my_pthread.c'</TT>.
<LI>

Run <CODE>thr_alarm</CODE>. If it runs without any ``warning'', ``error'' or aborted
messages, you are on the right track. Here is a successful run on
Solaris:

<H2><A NAME="Thread_packages" HREF="manual_toc.html#Thread_packages">E.6  Differences between different thread packages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1881"></A>

</P>
<P>
MySQL is very dependent on the thread package used. So when
choosing a good platform for MySQL, the thread package is very
important.

</P>
<P>
There are at least three types of thread packages:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

User threads in a single process. Thread switching is managed with
alarms and the threads library manages all non-thread-safe functions
with locks. Read, write and select operations are usually managed with a
thread-specific select that switches to another thread if the running
threads have to wait for data.  If the user thread packages are
integrated in the standard libs (FreeBSD and BSDI threads) the thread
package requires less overhead than thread packages that have to map all
unsafe calls (MIT-pthreads, FSU Pthreads and RTS threads).  In some
environments (for example, SCO), all system calls are thread-safe so the
mapping can be done very easily (FSU Pthreads on SCO).  Downside: All
mapped calls take a little time and it's quite tricky to be able to
handle all situations. There are usually also some system calls that are
not handled by the thread package (like MIT-pthreads and sockets). Thread
scheduling isn't always optimal.
<LI>

User threads in separate processes. Thread switching is done by the
kernel and all data are shared between threads.  The thread package
manages the standard thread calls to allow sharing data between threads.
LinuxThreads is using this method.  Downside: Lots of processes. Thread
creating is slow. If one thread dies the rest are usually left hanging
and you must kill them all before restarting. Thread switching is
somewhat expensive.
<LI>

Kernel threads. Thread switching is handled by the thread library or the
kernel and is very fast. Everything is done in one process, but on some
systems, <CODE>ps</CODE> may show the different threads. If one thread aborts, the
whole process aborts. Most system calls are thread-safe and should
require very little overhead.  Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and OSF/1 have kernel
threads.
</UL>

<P>
In some systems kernel threads are managed by integrating user
level threads in the system libraries. In such cases, the thread
switching can only be done by the thread library and the kernel isn't
really ``thread aware''.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="Environment_variables" HREF="manual_toc.html#Environment_variables">F  Environment Variables</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1882"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of all the environment variables that are used directly or
indirectly by MySQL. Most of these can also be found in other
places in this manual.

</P>
<P>
Note that any options on the command-line will take precedence over
values specified in configuration files and environment variables, and
values in configuration files take precedence over values in environment
variables.

</P>
<P>
In many cases it's preferable to use a configure file instead of environment
variables to modify the behaviour of MySQL. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Option_files">4.1.2  <TT>`my.cnf'</TT> Option Files</A>.

<H1><A NAME="Regexp" HREF="manual_toc.html#Regexp">G  MySQL Regular Expressions</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1925"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1926"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1927"></A>

</P>
<P>
A regular expression (regex) is a powerful way of specifying a complex search.

</P>
<P>
MySQL uses Henry Spencer's implementation of regular
expressions, which is aimed at conformance with POSIX
1003.2. MySQL uses the extended version.

</P>
<P>
This is a simplistic reference that skips the details. To get more exact
information, see Henry Spencer's <CODE>regex(7)</CODE> manual page that is
included in the source distribution. See section <A HREF="manual.html#Credits">C  Credits</A>.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest regexp is
one that has no special characters in it. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello</CODE> matches <CODE>hello</CODE> and nothing else.

</P>
<P>
Non-trivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that
they can match more than one string. For example, the regexp
<CODE>hello|word</CODE> matches either the string <CODE>hello</CODE> or the string
<CODE>word</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
As a more complex example, the regexp <CODE>B[an]*s</CODE> matches any of the
strings <CODE>Bananas</CODE>, <CODE>Baaaaas</CODE>, <CODE>Bs</CODE>, and any other string
starting with a <CODE>B</CODE>, ending with an <CODE>s</CODE>, and containing any
number of <CODE>a</CODE> or <CODE>n</CODE> characters in between.

</P>
<P>
A regular expression may use any of the following special
characters/constructs:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>^</CODE>
<DD>
Match the beginning of a string.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "fo\nfo" REGEXP "^fo$";           -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "fofo" REGEXP "^fo";              -&#62; 1

Match the end of a string.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "fo\no" REGEXP "^fo\no$";         -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "fo\no" REGEXP "^fo$";            -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>.</CODE>
<DD>
Match any character (including newline).

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "fofo" REGEXP "^f.*";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "fo\nfo" REGEXP "^f.*";           -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a*</CODE>
<DD>
Match any sequence of zero or more <CODE>a</CODE> characters.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba*n";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "Baaan" REGEXP "^Ba*n";           -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba*n";              -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a+</CODE>
<DD>
Match any sequence of one or more <CODE>a</CODE> characters.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba+n";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba+n";              -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>
<DD>
Match either zero or one <CODE>a</CODE> character.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "Bn" REGEXP "^Ba?n";              -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "Ban" REGEXP "^Ba?n";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "Baan" REGEXP "^Ba?n";            -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>de|abc</CODE>
<DD>
Match either of the sequences <CODE>de</CODE> or <CODE>abc</CODE>.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "pi" REGEXP "pi|apa";             -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "axe" REGEXP "pi|apa";            -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "apa" REGEXP "pi|apa";            -&#62; 1

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "pi" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";            -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "pip" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";           -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "pipi" REGEXP "^(pi)*$";          -&#62; 1
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>{1}</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>{2,3}</CODE>
<DD>
The is a more general way of writing regexps that match many
occurrences of the previous atom.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a*</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a+</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{1,}</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>a?</CODE>
<DD>
Can be written as <CODE>a{0,1}</CODE>.
</DL>
To be more precise, an atom followed by a bound containing one integer
<CODE>i</CODE> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <CODE>i</CODE> matches of
the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <CODE>i</CODE>
and a comma matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> or more matches of the atom.
An atom followed by a bound containing two integers <CODE>i</CODE> and
<CODE>j</CODE> matches a sequence of <CODE>i</CODE> through <CODE>j</CODE> (inclusive)
matches of the atom.

Both arguments must be in the range from <CODE>0</CODE> to <CODE>RE_DUP_MAX</CODE>
(default 255), inclusive.  If there are two arguments, the second must be
greater than or equal to the first.
<DT><CODE>[a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[^a-dX]</CODE>
<DD>
Matches
any character which is (or is not, if ^ is used) either <CODE>a</CODE>, <CODE>b</CODE>,
<CODE>c</CODE>, <CODE>d</CODE> or <CODE>X</CODE>. To include a literal <CODE>]</CODE> character,
it must immediately follow the opening bracket <CODE>[</CODE>.  To include a
literal <CODE>-</CODE> character, it must be written first or last. So
<CODE>[0-9]</CODE> matches any decimal digit. Any character that does not have
a defined meaning inside a <CODE>[]</CODE> pair has no special meaning and
matches only itself.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "[a-dXYZ]";         -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]$";       -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[a-dXYZ]+$";      -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "aXbc" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";     -&#62; 0
mysql&#62; SELECT "gheis" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";    -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "gheisa" REGEXP "^[^a-dXYZ]+$";   -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[.characters.]]</CODE>
<DD>
The sequence of characters of that collating element. The sequence is a
single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket expression
containing a multi-character collating element can thus match more than
one character, for example, if the collating sequence includes a <CODE>ch</CODE>
collating element, then the regular expression <CODE>[[.ch.]]*c</CODE> matches the
first five characters of <CODE>chchcc</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>[=character_class=]</CODE>
<DD>
An equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters of all
collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself.

For example, if <CODE>o</CODE> and <CODE>(+)</CODE> are the members of an
equivalence class, then <CODE>[[=o=]]</CODE>, <CODE>[[=(+)=]]</CODE>, and
<CODE>[o(+)]</CODE> are all synonymous. An equivalence class may not be an
endpoint of a range.

<DT><CODE>[:character_class:]</CODE>
<DD>
Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class enclosed in
<CODE>[:</CODE> and <CODE>:]</CODE> stands for the list of all characters belonging
to that class. Standard character class names are:

<TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD><STRONG>Name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Name</STRONG> </TD><TD> <STRONG>Name</STRONG>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>alnum </TD><TD> digit </TD><TD> punct

<TR><TD>blank </TD><TD> lower </TD><TD> upper
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>cntrl </TD><TD> print </TD><TD> xdigit
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

These stand for the character classes defined in the <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE> manual
page. A locale may provide others. A character class may not be used as an
endpoint of a range.

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "justalnums" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";       -&#62; 1
mysql&#62; SELECT "!!" REGEXP "[[:alnum:]]+";               -&#62; 0
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>[[:&#60;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>[[:&#62;:]]</CODE>
<DD>
These match the null string at the beginning and end of a word
respectively.  A word is defined as a sequence of word characters which
is neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word character is
an alnum character (as defined by <CODE>ctype(3)</CODE>) or an underscore
(<CODE>_</CODE>).

<PRE>
mysql&#62; SELECT "a word a" REGEXP "[[:&#60;:]]word[[:&#62;:]]";      -&#62; 1

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

<H2><A NAME="SEC886" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC886">H.2  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

<LI>

Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

</P>
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

version number 2.1.]
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC889" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC889">I.1  Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

</P>
<P>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

</P>
<P>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</P>
<P>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

</P>
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

</P>
<P>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

</P>
<P>
  We call this license the <STRONG>Lesser</STRONG> General Public License because it
does <EM>Less</EM> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

</P>
<P>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

</P>
<P>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

</P>
<P>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
``work based on the library'' and a ``work that uses the library''.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC890" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC890">I.2  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called ``this License'').  Each
licensee is addressed as ``you''.

  A ``library'' means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The ``Library'', below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A ``work based on the
Library'' means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term ``modification''.)

  ``Source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

The modified work must itself be a software library.

<LI>

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a ``work that uses the Library''.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a ``work that uses the
library''.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a ``work that uses the Library'' uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<LI>

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a ``work that uses the Library'' with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ``work that
uses the Library'', as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

<LI>

Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at runtime a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

<LI>

Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

<LI>

If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

<LI>

Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</OL>

  For an executable, the required form of the ``work that uses the
Library'' must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

<LI>

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

<LI>

Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</OL>

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
``any later version'', you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.



<P><STRONG>9.6  NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>

<LI>

BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<LI>

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

<H2><A NAME="SEC891" HREF="manual_toc.html#SEC891">I.3  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</A></H2>

<P>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

</P>
<P>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</P>

necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
