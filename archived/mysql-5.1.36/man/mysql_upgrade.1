\fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
examines all tables in all databases for incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL Server.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also upgrades the system tables so that you can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have been added.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL. It supersedes the older
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
script, which should no longer be used.
.PP
If a table is found to have a possible incompatibility,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
performs a table check. If any problems are found, a table repair is attempted. If the table cannot be repaired, see
Section\ 2.12.4, \(lqRebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes\(rq
for manual table repair strategies.

\fBCaution\fR
.PP
You should always back up your current MySQL installation
\fIbefore\fR
performing an upgrade. See
Section\ 6.1, \(lqDatabase Backups\(rq.
.PP
Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before you upgrade your MySQL installation and run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR. See
Section\ 2.12.1, \(lqUpgrading MySQL\(rq, for instructions on determining whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how to handle them.
.PP
To use
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, make sure that the server is running, and then invoke it like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
After running
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, stop the server and restart it so that any changes made to the system tables take effect.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
executes the following commands to check and repair tables and to upgrade the system tables:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysqlcheck \-\-all\-databases \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-auto\-repair
mysql < \fIfix_priv_tables\fR
mysqlcheck \-\-all\-databases \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-fix\-db\-names \-\-fix\-table\-names
.fi
.RE
.PP
Notes about the preceding commands:
.TP 3n
\(bu
Because
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
invokes
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
with the
\fB\-\-all\-databases\fR
option, it processes all tables in all databases, which might take a long time to complete. Each table is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it is being processed. Check and repair operations can be time\-consuming, particularly for large tables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
For details about what checks the
\fB\-\-check\-upgrade\fR
option entails, see the description of the
FOR UPGRADE
option of the
CHECK TABLE
statement (see
Section\ 12.5.2.3, \(lqCHECK TABLE Syntax\(rq).
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fIfix_priv_tables\fR
represents a script generated interally by
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
that contains SQL statements to upgrade the tables in the
mysql
database.
.TP 3n
\(bu
Prior to MySQL 5.1.31,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
does not run the second
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
command, which is necessary to re\-encode database or table names that contain nonalphanumeric characters. (They still appear after the upgrade with the
#mysql50#
prefix described in
Section\ 8.2.3, \(lqMapping of Identifiers to File Names\(rq.) If you have such database or table names, execute the second
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
command manually after executing
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR.
.sp
.RE
.PP
All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL version number. This ensures that next time you run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need to check or repair the table again.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
\fImysql_upgrade_info\fR
in the data directory. This is used to quickly check whether all tables have been checked for this release so that table\-checking can be skipped. To ignore this file and perform the check regardless, use the
\fB\-\-force\fR
option.
.PP
If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the server and client RPMs.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is included in the server RPM but requires the client RPM because the latter includes
\fBmysqlcheck\fR. (See
Section\ 2.4, \(lqInstalling MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux\(rq.)
.PP
In MySQL 5.1.7,
\fBmysql_upgrade \fR
was added as a shell script and worked only for Unix systems. As of MySQL 5.1.10,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is an executable binary and is available on all systems.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
supports the options in the following list. It also reads option files (the
[mysql_upgrade]
and
[client]
groups) and supports the options for processing them described at
Section\ 4.2.3.3.1, \(lqCommand\-Line Options that Affect Option\-File Handling\(rq. Other options are passed to
\fBmysqlcheck\fR. For example, it might be necessary to specify the
\fB\-\-password[=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
option.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR
.sp
Display a short help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-basedir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the MySQL installation directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-datadir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the data directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-check\fR
.sp
Print some debugging information when the program exits. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-info\fR,
\fB\-T\fR
.sp
Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the program exits. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-force\fR
.sp
Ignore the
\fImysql_upgrade_info\fR
file and force execution of
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
even if
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
has already been executed for the current version of MySQL.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-tmpdir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR,
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path name of the directory to use for creating temporary files. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.25.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR,
\fB\-u \fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR
.sp
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server. The default user name is
root.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.sp
