\fBndb_mgmd \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The management server is the process that reads the cluster configuration file and distributes this information to all nodes in the cluster that request it. It also maintains a log of cluster activities. Management clients can connect to the management server and check the cluster's status.
.PP
The following list includes options that are specific to
\fBndb_mgmd\fR. For options common to all NDB programs, see
Section\ 17.6.2, \(lqOptions Common to MySQL Cluster Programs\(rq.

When specified, this option limits management server connections by management clients to clients at the specified host name or IP address (and possibly port, if this is also specified). In such cases, a management client attempting to connect to the management server from any other address fails with the error
Unable to setup port: \fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR!
.sp
If the
\fIport\fR
is not specified, the management client attempts to use port 1186.
.sp
This option was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.2.5 and MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.2.

Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0, configuration data is cached internally rather than being read from the cluster global configuration file each time the management server is started (see
Section\ 17.3.4, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration Files\(rq). This option instructs the management server to its configuration cache in the
\fIdirectory\fR
indicated. By default, this is a directory named
\fImysql\-cluster\fR
in the MySQL installation directory \(em for example, if you compile and install MySQL Cluster on a Unix system using the default location, this is
\fI/usr/local/mysql\-cluster\fR.
.sp
This behavior can be overridden using the
\fB\-\-initial\fR
or
\fB\-\-reload\fR
option for
\fBndb_mgmd\fR. Each of these options is described elsewhere in this section.
.sp
This option is available beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0.

Instructs the management server as to which file it should use for its configuration file. By default, the management server looks for a file named
\fIconfig.ini\fR
in the same directory as the
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
executable; otherwise the file name and location must be specified explicitly.
.sp
Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0, this option is ignored unless the management server is forced to read the configuration file, either because
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
was started with the
\fB\-\-reload\fR
or
\fB\-\-initial\fR
option, or because the management server could not find any configuration cache. See
Section\ 17.3.4, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration Files\(rq, for more information.

Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0, configuration data is cached internally rather than being read from the cluster global configuration file each time the management server is started (see
Section\ 17.3.4, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration Files\(rq). Using this option overrides this behavior, by forcing the management server to delete any existing cache files, and then to re\-read the configuration data from the cluster configuration file and to build a new cache.
.sp
This differs in two ways from the
\fB\-\-reload\fR
option. First,
\fB\-\-reload\fR
forces the server to check the configuration file against the cache and reload its data only if the contents of the file are different from the cache. Second,
\fB\-\-reload\fR
does not delete any existing cache files.
.sp
If
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
is invoked with
\fB\-\-initial\fR
but cannot find a global configuration file, the management server cannot start.
.sp
This option was introduced in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0.

Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0, configuration data is stored internally rather than being read from the cluster global configuration file each time the management server is started (see
Section\ 17.3.4, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration Files\(rq). Using this option forces the management server to check its internal data store against the cluster configuration file and to reload the configuration if it finds that the configuration file does not match the cache. Existing configuration cache files are preserved, but not used.
.sp
This differs in two ways from the
\fB\-\-initial\fR
option. First,
\fB\-\-initial\fR
causes all cache files to be deleted. Second,
\fB\-\-initial\fR
forces the management server to re\-read the global configuration file and construct a new cache.
.sp
If the management server cannot find a global configuration file, then the
\fB\-\-reload\fR
option is ignored.
.sp
This option was introduced in MySQL Cluster NDB 6.4.0.

.PP
It is not strictly necessary to specify a connectstring when starting the management server. However, if you are using more than one management server, a connectstring should be provided and each node in the cluster should specify its node ID explicitly.
.PP
See
Section\ 17.3.4.3, \(lqThe MySQL Cluster Connectstring\(rq, for information about using connectstrings.
\fBndb_mgmd\fR(8), describes other options for
\fBndb_mgmd\fR.
.PP
The following files are created or used by
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
in its starting directory, and are placed in the
DataDir
as specified in the
\fIconfig.ini\fR
configuration file. In the list that follows,
\fInode_id\fR
is the unique node identifier.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fIconfig.ini\fR
is the configuration file for the cluster as a whole. This file is created by the user and read by the management server.
Section\ 17.3, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration\(rq, discusses how to set up this file.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fInode_id\fR\fR\fI_cluster.log\fR
is the cluster events log file. Examples of such events include checkpoint startup and completion, node startup events, node failures, and levels of memory usage. A complete listing of cluster events with descriptions may be found in
Section\ 17.7, \(lqManagement of MySQL Cluster\(rq.
.sp
When the size of the cluster log reaches one million bytes, the file is renamed to
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fInode_id\fR\fR\fI_cluster.log.\fR\fI\fIseq_id\fR\fR, where
\fIseq_id\fR
is the sequence number of the cluster log file. (For example: If files with the sequence numbers 1, 2, and 3 already exist, the next log file is named using the number
4.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fInode_id\fR\fR\fI_out.log\fR
is the file used for
stdout
and
stderr
when running the management server as a daemon.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fIndb_\fR\fI\fInode_id\fR\fR\fI.pid\fR
is the process ID file used when running the management server as a daemon.
